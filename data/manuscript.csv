Technical problem--PUL did not photograph some folios:  f. 20v (picture of f. 19v double, repetition after picture of f. 20r), f. 25v (picture of f. 23v double, repetition after f. 25r, instead of f. 25v); some characters illegible on the inner edge of some folios because of the picture quality (e.g. ff. 45ra, 46ra). PUL Catalog dated this manuscript to 1800s, but that is too late, says Vita.  She dated the manuscript  to the first half of the 18th century (1700-1750), on the basis of paleography; archaic form of some Ethiopic characters: the numeral ፮ has the loop open, looking like a “compressed” ፯ (e.g. f. 10vb); the letter ጵ  has the 6th order marker on the vertical stroke at the top and oriented to the left  (e.g. f. 27rb l. 5, f. 27va l. 8).",,2,15,8,,,,,Täˀammərä Maryam (Ta'ammera Maryam),27,0,,,,

We had called it W-London (BM) 77, after Wright's catalog. But Wright didn't catalog miracles, so when Dorothea worked on this, we decided to rename it, since the catalog wasn't the source. This mss is from the British Library Orient collection. The collection was cataloged by Wright, who didn't describe individual miracles (he gave only the total number of miracles). For this reason Macomber didn't include BL Orient mss in his handlist. This mss, however, was partly translated by Budge (in The Miracles of the Blessed Virgin Mary, and the Life of Hanna). This is the reason Macomber was able to match 69 stories out of the total number of 160 in this mss. The other records will be added from Beta Masaheft (Dorothea recataloged the mss in May 2020). Provenance information is from Beta Masaheft. Place (from where the manuscript was looted) is from Wright catalog.
