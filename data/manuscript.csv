For this reason Macomber didn't include BL Orient mss in his handlist. This mss, however, was partly translated by Budge (in The Miracles of the Blessed Virgin Mary, and the Life of Hanna). This is the reason Macomber was able to match 69 stories out of the total number of 160 in this mss. The other records will be added from Beta Masaheft (Dorothea recataloged the mss in May 2020).
