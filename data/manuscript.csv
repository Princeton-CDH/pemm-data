We had called it W-London (BM) 77, after Wright's catalog. But Wright didn't catalog miracles, so when Dorothea worked on this, we decided to rename it, since the catalog wasn't the source. This mss is from the British Library Orient collection. The collection was cataloged by Wright, who didn't describe individual miracles (he gave only the total number of miracles). For this reason Macomber didn't include BL Orient mss in his handlist. This mss, however, was partly translated by Budge (in The Miracles of the Blessed Virgin Mary, and the Life of Hanna). This is the reason Macomber was able to match 69 stories out of the total number of 160 in this mss. The other records will be added from Beta Masaheft (Dorothea recataloged the mss in May 2020).
