Instructions to those typing incipits and identifying story IDs,,,,,
Open your three work environments,,,,,
,Open the Story Instance Sheet in this spreadsheet,,,,
,"Open your manuscript in electronic form (for the manuscript that was assigned to you, either online, pdf, orphoto)",,,,
,Open the Incipit tool,,,,
,Arrange the Story Instance Sheet and manuscript in half screen so you can see them both at the same time,,,,
,,,,,
"In the manuscript, go to the first miracle story, usually the folio will be in the spreadsheet, if not this is almost never on the first folio or the first page of writing; usually there are pages of introductory material; the usual sign of the beginning of a miracle story are several lines in red ink)",,,,,
"Identify the first unique line of the first story (that is, skip the blessings that open them, the sign of the end of the blessings is ""la-amen amen"")",,,,,
,,,,,
"In the spreadhseet, locate the rows with your manuscript (e.g., ""EMML (HMML) 9002"")",,,,,
Check to see if any of the stories have already been identified with a Macomber ID,,,,,
Check to see if there is a translation or other useful information about content,,,,,
Select the first row so that you can type information there about the first miracle story,,,,,
Type in the following information from your manuscript (in order),,,,,
,"Folio Start, Column Start, and Line Start for where the miracle story starts (from the very beginning, with the blessing, not the first unique line) (a folio is a leaf, each side is called recto or verso)",,,,
,"Folio End, Column End, and Line End for where that miracle story ends",,,,
,"Miracle Number (if it is the fourth miracle story about Mary in the manuscript, put ""4"")",,,,
,"Number of paintings, if there are any images, and their size (for example, ""3 full-page images before the start of the story)",,,,
,Incipit (type in the first full two sentences of the unique first line) (use the sheet for the fidel code),,,,
,"If there is any issue with the incipit, note that in the note field (.g., letters tough to read, folio missing)",,,,
,"[If the incipit includes honorifics for Mary (mostly: ለእግዝእትነ፡ ቅድስት፡ ድንግል፡ በ፪ማርያም፡ ወላዲተ፡ አምላክ), paste it into the Note field and then take the phrase out of the incipit in the incipit field (replace the phrase with ...)]",,,,
,,,,,
"In the Incipit Tool, copy and paste the incipit",,,,,
Study the results to find out which Macomber ID best matches your incipit. ,,,,,
,"If you can understand the Ge`ez language,",,,,
,,read the results and see which incpit ID matches the best. ,,,
,,"If you have a clear match, place that number in the spreadsheet under Canonical Story ID and give it a High Confidence score.",,,
,,"Also copy and paste the best match into the Best Incipit Tool Match; such as ""EMML (HMML) 6949 142v.""",,,
,,"If you don't have a clear match, make your best guess and give it a Medium or Low Confidence Score",,,
,"If you can't understand the Ge'ez language,",,,,
,,"First, look at the ID numbers on the left. If the first three or more results are the same Macomber ID number (e.g., 140), place that number in the spreadsheet under Canonical Story ID and give it a High Confidence score",,,
,,"Second, if only one ID really matches, check the match score on the right. If it is high, and the one after it low, then you probably have a good match. You can put that number in the ID field, but mark it Medium confidence",,,
,,"Third, if nothing seems to really match, go back to the Note field in the spreadsheet and say ""No clear match"" and put no ID number",,,
,,"Fourth, if you don't get many results check your typing and spelling. Are there any typos? Or proper nouns spelled differently? (you don't have to worry about which h or s you use, but whether you use numerals, ፩ or አሐዱ, matters)",,,
,,"If you are fairly confident that you have picked the right ID for the story, but not certain, select Medium Confidence",,,
,,"If you are just guessing, no problem, select Low Confidence",,,
,,,,,
