Check to see if any of the stories have already been identified with a Macomber ID,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Check to see if there is a translation or other useful information about content,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Select the first row so that you can type information there about the first miracle story,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Type in the following information from your manuscript (in order),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Folio Start, Column Start, and Line Start for where the miracle story starts (from the very beginning, with the blessing, not the first unique line) (a folio is a leaf, each side is called recto or verso)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"If you are only typing incipits, you stop here and go to the next story. If you are doing more, you go on to do the following",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Study the results to find out which Macomber ID best matches your incipit. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"If you can understand the Ge`ez language,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,read the results and see which incpit ID matches the best. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,"If you have a clear match, place that number in the spreadsheet under Canonical Story ID and give it a High Confidence score.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,"Also copy and paste the best match into the Best Incipit Tool Match; such as ""EMML (HMML) 6949 142v.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,"If you don't have a clear match, make your best guess and give it a Medium or Low Confidence Score",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"If you can't understand the Ge'ez language,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,"First, look at the ID numbers on the left. If the first three or more results are the same Macomber ID number (e.g., 140), place that number in the spreadsheet under Canonical Story ID and give it a High Confidence score",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,"Second, if only one ID really matches, check the match score on the right. If it is high, and the one after it low, then you probably have a good match. You can put that number in the ID field, but mark it Medium confidence",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,"Third, if nothing seems to really match, go back to the Note field in the spreadsheet and say ""No clear match"" and put no ID number",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,"Fourth, if you don't get many results check your typing and spelling. Are there any typos? Or proper nouns spelled differently? (you don't have to worry about which h or s you use, but whether you use numerals, ፩ or አሐዱ, matters)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,"If you are fairly confident that you have picked the right ID for the story, but not certain, select Medium Confidence",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,"If you are just guessing, no problem, select Low Confidence",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
