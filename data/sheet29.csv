Mary forgave Stephen, and her son granted him given thirty days of life to correct his wrongdoings. On his way to his body, he heard his brother’s voice. Peter explained that he was in Jahannam, and that to save him Stephen would have to convince the church father to pray on his behalf. Once back in his body, Stephen went to the church and told the father everything that had happened to him, showing as proof the mark Saint Sirloreyos had left on his arm. The father prayed for Peter. Meanwhile, Stephen righted his wrongs and prayed daily to Mary. When he died again, he was saved."

One day the knight realized that he had led a sinful life, and he vowed to build a monastery in Mary’s name. The knight rode out of the city to find a place to build the monastery, and as he was contemplating a site, he died. Devils seized the knight’s soul and wanted to cast in into Sheol (Hell), but the Archangel Michael intervened, commanding the devils to release the knight. The devils refused, saying that if God judged the soul, then He would consign it to perdition. Michael appealed to Mary, who in turn pleaded with her son Jesus to have mercy on the knight’s soul.

The Apostle Peter appeared the bishop and promised punishment for his actions. Afraid, the bishop formed a council of wise men. Despite the bishop’s appeals for help, only one wise man stepped forward, advising him to seek mercy from the Virgin Mary. The bishop immediately prostrated before Mary’s altar, weeping bitter tears as he supplicated to the Holy Virgin. Mary appeared to the bishop and commanded him to leave the church, which he defiled with his presence. The bishop continued his beseeching, and Mary appeared again, once more commanding him to leave. When the bishop renewed his prayers, Mary, moved with compassion, implored her son Jesus to have mercy on the supplicant. Jesus granted Mary’s request. Together with the Apostle Peter, Mary appeared before the bishop, forgiving him his sins and ordering him not to commit the like again.

The priest chastised the handmaid for interrupting, and said the old woman could wait. A deacon, who was also in the room, said the priest should go, but the priest again refused, saying the old woman had days to live. The priest rebuffed further pleas for help, and the deacon decided to go himself. As he approached the old woman’s house, a bright light emanated from inside. Upon entering he saw Mary nursing the old woman, and as the woman entered painful death throes, Mary indicated that the deacon should administer the Holy Mystery. The deacon then returned to the dying man, whose body was being defiled by black creatures.

Just as the Muslim army arrived at the foot of the hill, the priest-ruler, who had assembled an army of his own, moved to attack.

Seeing their commitment to prayer, the ruler joined his wife and her mother in the forty-day fast for Lent. Three days before the end of Lent, the ruler’s wife had a vision in which the Apostle Bârtâloméwos |sp| appeared with incense and foretold that she would have a son. Satan appeared in the same vision, threatening to harm the woman, but she called on Bârtâloméwos for assistance and he vanquished the devil.

Bâtârgéla Maryam heard Christ call his name three times, and in response his rose up and praised Mary. Following this vision Bâtârgéla Maryam supplicated to Mary and incised himself with a razor. Then a man ruled by Satan made another accusation against Bâtârgéla Maryam. The ruler sent this man to summon his son, but after retrieving Bâtârgéla Maryam from his cell, the Satanic man did not take the boy directly to his father. Instead, he first led him through a place full of a deadly pestilence. When Bâtârgéla Maryam arrived at the palace, his father received him with tenderness and set him free. The Satanic man once again led Bâtârgéla Maryam through the plague-ridden area. But due to his supplications, the Virgin Mary prevented Bâtârgéla Maryam from falling ill. She also dispersed his accusers “like the dust of the field.”"
289,"As a deadly plague ravaged a Christian land, the ruler of that land commanded his children to hold rogation to God and the Virgin Mary. One of the ruler’s sons died, but Bâtârgéla Maryam remained untouched by the pestilence. It then happened that Bâtârgéla Maryam’s nephew, a wicked man, accused him of a false crime. At first, the Virgin Mary protected Bâtârgéla Maryam. But more false accusations poured into the palace, and in response the ruler grew angry and imprisoned his son, shackling his hands. Bâtârgéla Maryam prayed to the Virgin Mary for help. She eased his father’s anger, and the ruler allowed Bâtârgéla Maryam’s left hand to be unshackled. On the day Bâtârgéla Maryam’s left hand was freed, the ruler invited him to take communion. Bâtârgéla Maryam then fasted for the month of Nähase, on the seventh day of which month he also incised himself with a razor. On the day of the Assumption the ruler summoned to the palace Sabbuha Amlak |sp|, a wicked man who had made false accusations against Bâtârgéla Maryam.

314,"There was a man whose wife and children perished from the plague. He went to a church dedicated to the Virgin Mary and prayed, asking to become her servant. Afterward the man grew restless. He traveled to another country, went mad, and cast aside his clothing. He returned to his city and demanded that its inhabitants observe the clothing Mary had bestowed upon him. The man then went back to the church. Weeping bitterly, he prayed to Mary, who cured him of his madness."
319,"There was a Christian king who loved the Virgin Mary and had an image made of her likeness, adorned with silver, gold, and precious stones. Night and day he prayed before this image, which focused his faith and brought him great comfort. One day the king stood in front of the image and prayed to Mary. He wanted to know if he had a chance of entering Heaven, and if not, he asked Mary to remove his soul from the earthly kingdom. Mary appeared to the king openly (i.e., not in a dream or a vision), and, before she disappeared again, she promised that both the king and his children would have a place in Heaven."
320,"There was a Christian king who loved the Virgin Mary and had an image made of her likeness, adorned in gold. The king always prayed before this image in times of sorrow or anguish. Thus, when he learned that his general had rebelled by running off to joining his enemies, the Muslims, the king stood before the Holy Virgin’s likeness and prayed. He beseeched Mary to punish the rebel on his behalf. Mary answered at once, informing the king that she has already done as he asked. She then showed the king the rebel with his head cut off."
328,"There was a pious abbot who loved God and the Virgin Mary. Other holy men, swayed by Satan, mocked him for indulging in sexual sins that he had never committed. One day the holy men gathered to interrogate the abbot about his sexual past. Upset, the abbot retreated to the sacrarium, where he wept bitterly and prayed that God and Mary might deliver him from disgrace. In the ninth hour of the abbot’s prayers, Mary appeared in the church and chastised the holy men for allowing Satan into their hearts. She then proceeded into the sacrarium, took the abbot, and carried him up to Heaven."
353,"In the land of Agcazi |sp| (Ethiopia), there was a merchant who feared God and loved the Virgin Mary. One day this merchant bought a slave at one market and set off to sell him for a profit at another. But on the way the slave escaped. The merchant bought incense and three candles, then proceeded to a nearby church devoted to Mary. On the way, the merchant encountered a noblewoman flanked by two men. The noblewoman asked the merchant where he was heading and why, and the merchant answered. He explained that, in exchange for Mary’s help in recapturing his slave, he would offer her the incense and candles he had bought and pledge to serve her for the rest of his life. The merchant then followed the noblewoman toward the church, but she disappeared on the way. When the merchant arrived at the church, he showed the incense and candles to the priest, and the two of them prayed fervently to Mary. When the prayer was over the merchant found his slave just outside the church. The slave explained that a woman and two men had approached him and ordered him to go to the church. Upon hearing this miraculous story, the merchant made the slave a servant of the church and he devoted himself to Mary."
364,"In a certain monastery there was an abbot who was pious in every way, yet he rejected the hymns of Abbâ Giyorgis |sp| and abolished the holy man’s horologium (sä'atat) |sp| within his domain. Oppressed by the abbot’s cruelty, Abbâ Giyorgis appealed to the Virgin Mary for help in protecting himself and his work from slander. In response to Abbâ Giyorgis’s prayer, Jesus Christ commanded that the abbot’s soul should be made to ascend like the souls of the righteous elect. Separated from his body, the abbot’s soul first approached the realm of the archangels. Abbâ Giyorgis appeared there among the archangels, ranked as their equal. As they gathered around the abbot, the archangels cited the abbot’s slander against Abbâ Giyorgis and refused to greet him. The abbot then ascended to the realm of the seraphim. Abbâ Giyorgis appeared there as well, and the seraphim also refused to greet the abbot. The same thing happened in the realms of the cherubim, the prophets, the apostles, the martyrs, and the holy fathers. When the abbot reached the Virgin Mary, she commanded the abbot to submit to Abbâ Giyorgis and compensate him for wrongs done against him. When the abbot returned to his former existence, he reinstated Abbâ Giyorgis’s horologium and ensured that it was chanted every day and night within his domain."
365,"There was a monk who loved God, and whom the Virgin Mary visited frequently due to his piety. It happened once that, when Mary was with the monk in the third hour of the day, some clergymen began to chant the horologium (sä'atat) |sp| of Abbâ Giyorgis |sp|. When the clergymen came to the verse that called for Mary to come at the day’s third hour, Mary prepared to leave the monk. The monk asked her where she was going and inquired whether there was one who loved her as he did. Mary responded that she was going to cleanse those assembled of all their sins. Hearing of the grace Mary would bestow upon the clergymen, the monk told her he would join those assembled and remain part of the church community for the rest of his life. Mary blessed the monk along with the assembled clergymen, then ascended to Heaven."
378,"There was a certain holy man named Yohannes (John) Kama |sp| who grew up devoted to Christ. When Yohannes reached adulthood, his family betrothed him to a young virgin. However, Yohannes and his bride made an agreement to remain virgins for the rest of their lives. One Sunday night the Virgin Mary appeared to Yohannes. Angels hovered about her, and Yohannes fell down in fear. Mary lifted him back up and blessed him. She then encouraged him to stay strong, and promised to protect him and his spiritual family for three generations. Mary also told Yohannes that a church with impregnable walls would be built in his name, and that his spiritual children would follow in his path and, like him, inherit everlasting life in Heaven. Mary gave Yohannes three dinars stamped with the Cross and told him to deposit them in the church treasury. Finally, she offered Yohannes a salutation of peace and departed."
383,"There was a man who loved the Eucharist and took communion on every festival of Our Lady Mary. This man never ate anything before he received the offering, and one day he fainted as he made his way to the church. While resting under a tree the man wept and prayed to the Virgin Mary. Mary heard the man’s prayer and called upon her Son to come to his aid. He responded to his mother’s petition by sending priests and bread to where the man lay. The priests pitched a tent and established a shrine inside it. They then celebrated the Eucharist, and the man received the offering with them."
384,"A certain monk regularly observed the fast of the Virgin Mary, but aside from this had no good deeds to his credit. When this monk died the angel of death took him to Sheol (Hell). Mary went to her Son and begged him to have compassion for the monk, since every year he kept the fast in her honor. Christ assented, and the monk was granted entry to Paradise."
391,"One night, as he was sleeping, Malka Sedeq |sp| was startled by the voice of a shining man. This man held in his hand a sign of the Cross, and he beckoned Malka Sedeq to follow him to the gate [presumably of the house where he slept]. There Malka Sedeq saw a vision of forty men wearing crowns, and the shining man informed him these were the kings of Israel. Then the ground around Malka Sedeq began to brighten, as if he stood in broad daylight. Startled, he looked up and saw a crown even more splendid than those worn by the kings of Israel. The Virgin Mary held the crown in her hands, suspended in air and flanked by two angels vested in fire. Below Mary there was a rainbow-like circle, and something resembling a palace hovered above her. A voice said, “Give me this kingdom which I want.” Mary responded that she had done so. The voice belonged to a man Mary addressed as Zärˀa Yaˁəqob |sp|, whom she summoned to her suspended platform of air, and on whose head she placed the splendid crown. Mary blessed Zärˀa Yaˁəqob, and the kings of Israel sang his praises as well."
393,"A man named Malka Sedeq |sp|, who had become a monk in his youth, was now a pious and humble priest who loved the Virgin Mary. One day Mary appeared to Malka Sedeq in a vision and brought him to a high mountain, on whose purple summit there stood a great throne. A great man sat in the throne, and when Malka Sedeq asked Mary his identity, she said it was Zärˀa Yaˁəqob |sp|. Another man emerged from behind Malka Sedeq, and he too asked who sat in the mountaintop throne. Mary repeated Zärˀa Yaˁəqob’s name and explained that this king was the unshakable executor of her Son’s will. She advised both to follow him in good faith. Malka Sedeq and the other man went to the court, and the king granted both of them favor and fortune."
394,"The Virgin Mary showed a vision to an individual who remains unspecified in the story. This vision consisted of two streams standing side by side, one on the right and the other on the left. The stream on the right was white as snow, whereas the stream on the left was black. Many people came and populated the streams on each side. Those on the right side had bright faces and danced happily. Those on the left side suffered from tribulations; they were the faithless ones who bought unrest to the kingdom of God. Mary, alongside her Son, presided over the stream on the right side, whose people she honored and protected."
395,"On the altar in a monastery church there stood an icon of the Virgin Mary and her Son, as well as pictures of the archangels Michael and Gabriel. One day, during the celebration of the Eucharist, a priest unwittingly dropped a piece of bread meant for Communion. Mary ordered Michael to lift the fallen Body of Christ from the ground and deliver it to her Son. Michael obeyed Mary’s command. Jesus then instructed the archangel to restore the piece of bread to the paten, which he did. Sometime later, a monk from another place arrived at this same church, and there her prayed with the help of the abbot. The Virgin Mary appeared and revealed that the visiting monk had been excommunicated from his church. She then commanded the monk to return to his monastery and ask the abbot there for forgiveness. Those at the monastery gave the monk two boys to help him prepare for his journey, and he kidnapped one of the boys. When the monks at the monastery discovered what had happened, they sent a letter to the disgraced monk chastising him for his actions, but still encouraging him to resolve his excommunication."
396,"An assembly of more than one hundred monks gathered one Sunday Sabbath at the church of Täˀkä Maryam |sp|. When a Muslim man arrived, a monk named Tanseˀa Krəstos |sp| asked him why he had come to a place of Christian learning and worship. The Muslim replied that he had come to hear the book, and he asked whether Christianity was better than Islam. A discussion about religion ensued, and Tanseˀa Krəstos attempted to convince the Muslim man to convert. Doubtful of the zealous Christian’s words, the Muslim asserted that Christ would not save Tanseˀa Krəstos from a fire. The Christian rebutted, declaring that if Christ did in fact save him from a fire, then the Muslim would have to convert. The Muslim agreed. After reassembling on a hill near the monastery, the monks asked Tanseˀa Krəstos to postpone the trial until Monday. But the Christian, burning with love for the Virgin Mary and her Son, declined. So the monks built an intense fire around Tanseˀa Krəstos. The Muslim was brought to inspect the fire and make sure it was hot enough. The monks showed the Muslim a large axe, which was melting from the extreme heat. Awestruck by the Christian man’s miraculous survival, the Muslim immediately converted."
402,"There was a man who fed a community of saints on a daily basis. One day, however, he ran out of food. He prayed to the Virgin Mary that she might help him feed the holy men, who were hungry and suffering. Upon hearing the man’s prayer, Mary went to the assembly of saints, spoke to them of peace, and cautioned them against doubt. After Mary disappeared from their sight, the saints finished their service, and when the returned to their house they found there a full supply of their customary food and drink."
403,"There was a monk who devoted himself to the Virgin Mary, and who lived a life entirely free from sin. One day Satan came to this monk, disguised as an ascetic. Satan praised the monk for his piety, then tricked him into believing that he had not yet achieved “the greatest merit.” Hoping to prove his superior piety the monk agreed to bow before the ascetic and do his bidding. Just as he bowed his head, the Virgin Mary appeared and confronted Satan, striking him dead. Mary embraced the monk, gently chastised him for coming under evil influence, and made a sign over him to prevent Satan from drawing near again."
404,"A poor monk who had no clothing, food, or drink prayed to the Virgin Mary for help. Mary appeared to him in a midnight vision and offered him a garment. When the monk woke, he found the garment and rejoiced."
405,"There was a poor man whose entire body was covered in leprous sores, and so needed to be carried around on a bed. On the sixteenth day of Nähase |sp|, he wished to receive Communion. But the men who typically carried him around refused to take him to the church, saying that they disliked the stench of his wounds. The leprous man wept bitterly and cried out to the Virgin Mary, expressing sorrow that he would miss the festival in her honor. Mary then came to the man and healed his wounds. The man stood up, ran to the church, and gave thanks to the Holy Virgin. Everyone who saw the cured man marveled at Mary’s miracle."
406,"There was a pious priest who provided comfort to all who came to him. One day Satan disguised himself as a man and tricked the priest into following him to go instruct some faithful people. On the road they met a believer whose wife, Satan informed him, had been unfaithful with the very priest he was traveling with. The priest immediately returned to his house. Meanwhile, Satan disguised himself as the priest, went to the believer’s house, and had intercourse with his wife. The Virgin Mary then appeared before the dismayed believer and commanded him to dismiss his wife from his house, for she was a whore. Both the believer and the real priest rejoiced in Mary’s miraculous intervention."
409,"A generous and faithful governor went to his king to pay five hundred dinars in taxes. When the governor arrived, the king accused him of having destroyed his kingdom, then ordered some soldiers to behead the falsely accused man. But when the soldiers attempted to execute the governor, the sword refused to cut through his neck. Furious, the king demanded to know whom the governor worshiped. When the governor responded that he devoted himself to the Virgin Mary, the king had him put him in prison. That night Mary appeared to the king in a dream and commanded him to release her servant from prison. The king immediately awoke. Trembling with fear, he summoned the governor from his cell and invited the man henceforth to live with him in the palace."
410,"There was a poor man who loved the Virgin Mary and who wanted to build a martyrium in her honor, but he lacked the money to do so. He wondered aloud who might help him, then he fell asleep. While the man was sleeping, Mary appeared to his wife in a dream. She showed the woman a mark she had made on the ground and told her to dig there. When the woman woke up, she roused her husband and took him to the spot Mary had indicated. They began to dig, and there in the ground they discovered a pot filled with gold. Afterward, the man and his wife summoned people from seven neighboring cities and employed them to build the martyrium, which took only three years to construct."
411,"One day, a hunter who believed in the Virgin Mary caught a gassa kalb |sp| (a dog-headed beast known as a cynocephalus) in his snare, and and when he saw the animal he became afraid. The hunter told others about the animal he had caught, and when they looked upon it they too became afraid. The hunter joined the others in the church, where they prayed before an icon of Mary. Afterward, they all returned to the captured animal. The hunter saw a woman standing before the gassa kalb, but he was the only one; the others did not believe him and called him a liar. Upset by their words, the hunter approached the gassa kalb. The woman, who was the Holy Virgin, called out to the men so they would be able see her. Then, with a great blow, she killed the gassa kalb. Mary gave the animal’s body to the hunter, who in turn gave it to the people. Everyone marveled at the miracle and praised the Virgin Mary."
412,"A young religious man asked his mother to go to church with him to pray. When they arrived at the church, they saw that the icon of the Virgin Mary was weeping. A voice spoke through the icon, telling the young man not to reveal what he had seen. Later, through Mary's prayer, the young man became a monk."
414,"One day, a man who had never been faithful to his religion fell ill during a journey. His illness was severe and left him helpless. After paying for a physician’s services and purchasing medicine, the man ran out of money. Newly poor, the man asked his wife to celebrate the commemoration of the Virgin Mary, then he fell asleep. Mary came to the man in his sleep and pointed out that it was only upon his death that he claimed to know her. The man answered with a promise to become her servant if she healed him. In response, Mary healed the man by anointing his body with her spittle."
420,"The ruler of a strictly guarded Christian country appointed a new official to an important office. This new official made friends with a local man, whom he hoped would grant him favors once he was in power. They made a covenant, and the official gave the man’s wife expensive clothing. But the ruler appointed the official to a different country, and when he left, the couple with whom he had made a covenant worried about having accepted the official’s bribe. The couple confided in a friend, who suggested that they alter the clothing the official gave them, then donate it to a church dedicated to the Virgin Mary. The confidant helped the couple alter the clothing, and after the garments had been donated, Mary relieved the couple’s anxiety. Then, on the twenty-ninth day of Mägabit |sp|, Mary appeared before the confidant and told him he would receive a beating from the country’s ruler. Nine months later, after the beating had taken place, the man had a vision in which he followed Mary into a large, white tent, where the country’s ruler lay. Mary directed the man to take the ruler’s silver ring, to suckle at his breast, and to make a memorial for him. After he had done all of these things, Mary disappeared, and upon waking the man became the country’s new ruler."
1005,"A widow named Zämäda Maryam |sp| lived alone with her children at Däbrä Zämäddo. The grotto where this building stood belonged to the Virgin Mary, who had received it as a tithe from her Son. Mary wanted the grotto back, so she decided to evict Zämäda Maryam and her children. To this end she influenced a monk named Bärtälomewos |sp|, who was traveling from his home in Mǝṣraḥa |sp| to Jerusalem. Sending the archangels Michael and Gabriel along as guides, Mary redirected Bärtälomewos to Däbrä Zämäddo. When Bärtälomewos arrived and instructed Zämäda Maryam to vacate the premises, the woman refused. The monk informed Mary of the woman’s refusal. That night, while the woman and her children slept, Mary conducted them and all their possessions through the air, setting them down gently in a field called Märḥǝbä Si’ol |sp|. When Zämäda Maryam awoke, she stood up and returned to the grotto to discover what was going on. There she saw Bärtälomewos with the Virgin Mary’s tabot, standing before a wooden curtain. Däbrä Zämäddo was also filled with doves, a sight that amazed Zämäda Maryam. The story concludes with a warning for the reader not to judge Mary for evicting the woman."
1006,"After Abunä Bärtälomewos |sp| died, the Virgin Mary summoned Abunä Yoḥannǝs |sp| to leave his country of Gan Amora |sp|. Out of his love for Mary, Abunä Yoḥannǝs answered Mary’s call for him to set off from his home. Once he was on the road, a thought came to him that he should travel to Jerusalem. That night he slept in a village, where he had found lodging. At midnight, Mary came to Abunä Yoḥannǝs, took him to Jerusalem, and showed him all the holy sites there. He woke up back in the village and resumed his journey. He met a poor woman and listened to her views on spiritual matters. Later, he met some monks who were on their way to visit Abbâ Täṭämqä Mädḫǝn |sp| and joined them. However, the monks were inconsiderate and left Abunä Yoḥannǝs outside while they went in to speak with the head monk. Abbâ Täṭämqä Mädḫǝn asked the monks to find Abunä Yoḥannǝs, and once they brought him inside, the head monk told him that the poor woman he had met on the road had been Mary in disguise. Mary then came and brought Abunä Yoḥannǝs to Däbrä Zämäddo |sp|, where she installed him as the new abbot."
1007,"Two years after the Virgin Mary appointed Abunä Yoḥannǝs |sp| the abbot of Däbrä Zämäddo |sp|, she informed him, through Abunä Täṭämqä Mädḫǝn |sp|, that he would go to Jerusalem. Before leaving on this journey, Abunä Yoḥannǝs visited a pious woman named Sälome |sp| in the country of Qǝbtya |sp|. He asked Sälome to pray for Mary to guide him on his journey. Sälome then went to speak with Mary about Abunä Yoḥannǝs’s visit. Mary showed Sälome a vision of Däbrä Zämäddo |sp|, sister to Jerusalem and the most honored monastery of Ethiopia. Mary also told Sälome the history of Däbrä Zämäddo, including the eviction of Zämädä Maryam |sp| as well as Abunä Yoḥannǝs’s role in establishing the monastery."
1008,"After Abunä Yoḥannǝs |sp| had finished constructing the church at Däbrä Zämäddo |sp|, he placed an icon of the Virgin Mary on a chair. One day the icon fell off the chair without anyone noticing. Mary went to Abunä Yoḥannǝs directly and asked him about the fallen picture. Abunä Yoḥannǝs instructed a man from his household to go restore the icon to its proper position. At first the man insisted that the icon was already in place, but he followed the abbot’s orders and found that the icon had indeed fallen. He put the image back in place, then returned to Abunä Yoḥannǝs and explained what had happened. The abbot was pleased that the man had told the truth and explained the importance of not telling lies."
1009,"When Abunä Yoḥannǝs |sp| had been the abbot at Däbrä Zämäddo |sp| for five years, herdsmen in the surrounding country grew upset with him and began to argue with him constantly. One day the monastery’s cow was trespassing and grazing on their land, so the herdsmen captured the cow and took it home with them, planning to drink its milk. Abunä Yoḥannǝs knew that the herdsmen had taken the cow out of spite and arrogance, and he went to the Virgin Mary for help. Mary decided to change the color of the cow’s milk from pure white to blood red. As the story explains, Mary had performed a similar miracle with the scissors of Jacob the Short of Qälmon |sp|. When the herdsmen saw the color of the milk, they begged for forgiveness. Abunä Yoḥannǝs accepted their repentance."
1010,"At Däbrä Zämäddo |sp|, the monks grew arrogant and came to despise the order of Abunä Yoḥannǝs |sp|. Disturbed and saddened by the monks’ revolt, Abunä Yoḥannǝs confided in the Virgin Mary regarding the oppression he faced. He also explained that since she was the impartial ruler of everyone at the monastery, she must decide what to do. Mary then sent a pestilence to the monastery, and forty of the monks died within a week. Abbâ Bǝnyami |sp|, who lived in Gärägära |sp|, witnessed the destructiveness of the pestilence and warned Abunä Yoḥannǝs to pray to Mary and save the remaining monks. Abunä Yoḥannǝs started rogation, and every day for twelve days he carried a big rock on his head and toured the shrine. At the end of this period, the pestilence waned. Mary also came to Abunä Yoḥannǝs with a message for the remaining monks. The message was that the Arämi |sp| would come to destroy all Christians and their churches, and that the only hope of survival would be to flee."
1011,"Twenty-one years after Abunä Yoḥannǝs |sp| received the Virgin Mary’s message about the coming destruction at the hands of the Arämi |sp|, the prophecy was at hand. The Arämi came and all Christians fled, including those at Däbrä Zämäddo |sp|. When the Arämi reached to the monastery, they wanted to drink from a stream of water that flowed from a cliff to the church. But as the approached the water, Mary made the water flee in the direction of the betä lǝḥem |sp| (""house of bread;"" i.e., the building where the Eucharist is prepared). The Arämi then approached from the opposite direction, but Mary reversed the stream’s flow once again. Finally, the Arämi attempted to surround the water, and Mary sent the water in every direction, even suspending some in midair. Unable to drink, the Arämi attempted to enter the shrine, but Mary sent insects to bit and sting them. They fled Däbrä Zämäddo and did not return. No one entered the shrine again until the years of Arämi reign had passed. At that time Mary returned the shrine’s treasures from the places in other countries where they had been taken for safekeeping. The treasures included the Śǝʿǝlä Adḫǝno |sp| (i.e., a sacred icon) as well as three tabots: one of Jesus, one of the Holy Virgin and one of Abunä Bärtälomewos |sp|."
1012,"When the monks of Däbrä Zämäddo |sp| fled to other countries, they brought the monastery’s icon of the Virgin Mary with them and left it in the city of Ruha |sp|. Before they left, they also took as many of the monastery’s books as they could carry and stashed them in a cave, the entrance to which was adjacent to the shrine. This cave was perpetually wet, since spring water seeped in from above and dripped down the cavern’s sides. Despite sitting in this wet cave for fifty years, and despite being made of parchment and ink, the books remained miraculously intact, thanks to Mary’s intervention."
1013,"A monk named Habtä Śǝllase |sp| was searching for the icon of the Virgin Mary from Däbrä Zämäddo |sp|. This monk had traveled far, and when he arrived at Däbrä Lalibäla |sp|, Mary came to him and told him that her icon had been hidden there ever since its removal from Däbrä Zämäddo. Mary directed him to a nearby church. There Habtä Śǝllase inquired about the icon, but nobody knew anything about it. He fell asleep in despair, but Mary came to him in a dream and showed him the exact place where her icon lay hidden. When he woke up, he went to the location Mary had shown him and found the icon. On the journey to return the icon to Däbrä Zämäddo, Habtä Śǝllase came upon a fork in the road. Mary instructed him to take the path on the right. She also urged him to hurry, since a black dog was coming along the other road. Habtä Śǝllase and his retinue had walked for three miles when one of his servants said he needed to return to the fork to retrieve a forgotten item. Habtä Śǝllase begged the servant to heed Mary’s warning, but he did not. When the servant arrived at the fork, he discovered not a black dog but Arämi |sp| soldiers, who promptly killed him."
1014,"Once the icon Śǝʿǝlä Adḫǝno |sp| was returned to Däbrä Zämäddo |sp|, the people of the royal camp sent a thief there to steal the holy image. The thief entered the shrine at night and removed the icon, but the Virgin Mary directed the man to a field, tied his legs with a rope, and left him there. The next day, a man who was out on his own business entered the field and came upon the tied-up thief and the icon. The people of the country wanted to execute the thief for stealing their beloved icon. However, after hearing Mary’s judgment on the matter, the abbot pardoned him. The narrator then recounts a similar miracle that occurred in Ṣaydnāyā |sp|, in the house of Märina |sp|. A man named Afrǝngawi |sp| had heard about a wondrous icon there that poured forth healing sweat. He went to Märina and, out of his love for Mary, he tried to steal the icon. When he realized he could not to take the whole thing, he attempted to cut the icon in half, and it began to bleed profusely. When others saw the blood on Afrǝngawi’s clothing, they thought he had killed someone and wanted to execute him. Just as she did with the thief at Däbrä Zämäddo, Mary pardoned Afrǝngawi."
1015,"Abunä Bärtälomewos brought a tabot into the grotto at Däbrä Zämäddo |sp|, and there he established a place to stand on top of a rock. The grotto was very dry, and one day, as the abbot was standing there, the Virgin Mary caused milk to spring from under his feet. Abunä Bärtälomewos praised Mary for performing her miracle, then asked her to change the milk into water, as water was more appropriate for the monks. Mary heard the abbot’s request and changed the milk into water."
1016,"On the feast day of Abunä Bärtälomewos |sp|, the people of Dänägäz |sp| gathered at Däbrä Zämäddo |sp| to celebrate the Virgin Mary’s blessings. Traditionally this feast day provided an opportunity for the people gathered to tell the abbot about the hardships they faced. On this day the people of Dänägäz spoke to Abunä Yoḥannǝs |sp| of their oppressive ruler. Abunä Yoḥannǝs summoned the ruler and asked him to show his people greater kindness. The ruler agreed to do as the abbot said, but when he returned home, the ruler grew angry. He claimed that he would never return to Däbrä Zämäddo or be ruled by the abbot there. Hearing of these claims, Abunä Yoḥannǝs consulted with the Virgin Mary. Mary explained that the ruler had prophesied his own death with these arrogant claims, and she sent “the cup of death” (poison?) to kill the ruler. The narrator then tells of similar events that occurred when a ruler named Gǝlyanos |sp| arrogantly slandered his abbot. As with the ruler of Dänägäz, Mary also killed Gǝlyanos."
1017,"At Däbrä Zämäddo |sp| there were three monks who piously devoted themselves to prayer. When not tending to monastic duties, these monks labored together to farm their own field. The monks faced many difficulties with their farming, and one year, after sowing the last of their seeds, they decided to move to another country where the farming would be better. But the Virgin Mary wanted them to remain at her monastery, so she planted the idea in the monks’ minds to spend the night fasting and leave the following day. That night the monks fetched water from the spring that Mary had made bubble up under the feet of Abunä Bärtälomewos |sp|. The monks divided the water into gourds, and when they drank it they found that the water had turned into honey. Thus well fed, the monks decided to stay at Däbrä Zämäddo for another day. The next day the water turned to honey again, and the monks decided to stay yet longer. This pattern continued for months, keeping the monks at the monastery from Säne |sp| to Mäskäräm |sp|. By Mäskäräm the monks’ field, which they had sown with the last of their seed, had produced perfect ears of corn ready for harvest."
1018,"Above the church of the Virgin Mary at Däbrä Zämäddo |sp| there stood a mountain. One day three large boulders broke off the cliff and came down toward the church. The first boulder missed. The second hit the betä lǝḥem |sp| (""house of bread;"" i.e., the building where the Eucharist is prepared), causing a wall to collapse and the roof to cave in while clergymen were inside. However, Mary protected the clergymen, saving them and the other buildings from harm. The third boulder thundered toward the shrine just as Abbâ Bäʾaminä Ǝgziʾabḥer |sp| was emerging from it. When he saw this, he called out in the names of Abunä Bärtälomewos |sp|, the Virgin Mary, and Jesus Christ, commanding the boulder to stop where it was. The boulder miraculously stopped, suspended in midair."
1019,"The church at Däbrä Zämäddo |sp| was difficult to access, as it stood by a precipitous cliff, and people had injured themselves and even died while entering or exiting it. Abunä Ṣama Iyyäsus |sp| wondered how to make church access safer. One day a big tree near the church fell down. The abbot gave the order to cut the tree into logs and use them, along with some stones, to construct a path to the church. But the new path, which was intended to improve access, made matters worse, since it was not level and hence further obstructed the entrance. Dismayed, Abunä Ṣama Iyyäsus asked the Virgin Mary to help level the crooked path. Mary heard his prayer. Despite the fact that it was the dry season, she caused a great rain to fall. The water poured down the cliff and on to the path, packing its crevasses with sand. In the morning the people of Däbrä Zämäddo saw that the path had miraculously been leveled."
1020,"During the period when Abunä Ṣama Iyyäsus |sp| served as the abbot of Däbrä Zämäddo |sp|, it came to pass that the Arämi |sp| declared war against the Christian regions of Wakat |sp|, Ṭäṭära |sp|, Mäqdäla |sp|, and the lowlands. When Abunä Ṣama Iyyäsus heard about this declaration, he prepared to fight back. He wielded his prayers like weapons: his prayer to God was his sword, and his prayer to the Virgin Mary was his spear. He also made a covenant with Mary, which served as his shield. Between the months of Ḫədar |sp| and Mägabit |sp|, Mary prevented disaster by dispersing the Arämi soldiers. Even so, the Arämi fighting spirit did not wane, and Mary eventually led the soldiers to the land of Adäl. There the Arämi were defeated; only twelve of their chiefs survived."
1021,"In the land of Mälko Amba |sp| there lived a married man who took a concubine into his house. After quarreling with him, this man’s wife sent a letter to Abunä Yoḥannǝs |sp| at Däbrä Zämäddo |sp| and asked for his help. The abbot went to the married couple and offered them spiritual counsel. The husband cast the concubine out of his house, and peace was restored. Five months later, the husband brought the concubine back. This occurred during the rainy season, when the river Ṣǝllare |sp| was unpassable. The husband taunted his wife, knowing that Abunä Yoḥannǝs would not be able to come again. But God revealed this woman’s tribulations to Abunä Yoḥannǝs, and he prayed that the Virgin Mary might help. Upon hearing the abbot’s plea, Mary told him to go to the river and divide the water with his cross. He followed her instructions, and after passing through the divided waters, Abunä Yoḥannǝs went to the man and arrested him. Neighbors came out to intercede, begging the abbot to let the man go. Out of his love for Mary, Abunä Yoḥannǝs eventually decided to release his prisoner."
1022,"In the country of Mägdälo |sp| there was a church built in the name of the Virgin Mary, and near this church there lived a woman named Maḫdärä Maryam |sp|. After many years of living there and devoting herself to Mary, Maḫdärä Maryam’s husband, who was the country’s ruler, moved her to compound sixty miles away from the church. Her husband went on a long military campaign, and while he was away he committed adultery. Maḫdärä Maryam heard about this and sent her husband a letter expressing her wish never to see him again. He obeyed her wish. Recognizing this woman as a chosen one, the Virgin Mary sent a letter to Maḫdärä Maryam asking her to give up the house she had built in the compound. When the woman refused, Mary sent intercessors to ask on her behalf. When Maḫdärä Maryam refused again, Mary went herself to ask why she had denied her. Maḫdärä Maryam agreed to let Mary move in, but she wanted to know where she herself would live. Mary said she should live next door so that she could come to her church night and day."
1023,"Maḫdärä Maryam |sp| lived next door to a church of the Virgin Mary and devoted herself completely to the Holy Virgin. In addition to her religious devotions Maḫdärä Maryam also tended fields. Every year she alternated between planting wheat and barley, the harvests from which she made bread and beer for the clergy and the poor. One year Maḫdärä Maryam’s son asked to take over the farm and prepare for the feast of the Assumption. But once he had control of the fields, he decided not prepare for the feast, and when the time for celebration arrived, he disappeared. When she heard about her son’s actions, Maḫdärä Maryam put on the clothing she wore for Communion, climbed into bed, and called on the Virgin Mary to come take her away. On the day of the feast the clergy arrived at the church, but Maḫdärä Maryam was not there. The decided to check on her, since she was never absent from church. They went to her house and found that she had died in her bed."
1024,"In the country of Śǝmrätä Ab |sp| there lived a monk who fastidiously devoted himself to God and to the Virgin Mary. During a certain period the people of Śǝmrätä Ab experienced much grief, and God responded by covering the earth with a great storm that ruined the grain harvest and washed away farmland. After four months of storms, the monk entered the shrine to pray for the Virgin Mary to intercede on the people’s behalf and banish the darkness. The monk left the shrine and, looking up at a cloud, cried out: “Be removed!” The cloud immediately disappeared and the sun came out."
1025,"In the country of Gǝbṣawit |sp| there was a child named Qwǝrbanä Dǝngǝl |sp|, over whom the Virgin Mary kept special watch. One morning Qwǝrbanä Dǝngǝl took a calf to the field. He played all day with other children, and when he returned home in the evening he left the calf behind. His mother told him to go retrieve the calf, and when Qwǝrbanä Dǝngǝl arrived back at the field he found a leopard. The boy led the leopard out of the field by beating it with a stick. Despite being a fierce and dangerous creature, the leopard did not attack the child, thanks to the Virgin Mary’s protection."
1026,"When Qwǝrbanä Dǝngǝl reached school age, his parents engaged a teacher for him. He memorized the hymn (mälkǝʿ) |sp| of the Virgin Mary, and for years he sang the hymn everywhere he went. Everyone knew him by his tendency to shout Mary’s name. The Arämi |sp| who lived in the neighborhood hated the boy’s singing, so they planned to kill him. They followed Qwǝrbanä Dǝngǝl, intending to ambush him when he was cutting wood. But even though they could clearly hear him sing the hymn to Mary, they could not find him, since the Holy Virgin hid him from their eyes."
1027,"In the country of Śǝmrätä Ab |sp|, there was a church devoted to the Virgin Mary. Next to the church there stood a large tree that continued to widen until it became larger than the church. The clergymen were sad, as they were unsure how to solve the problem. If they cut the tree it would fall on the church, but if they did nothing it would eventually fall on the church regardless. The clergymen held rogation at vespers and prayed to Mary for help. When the they returned to the church the following day they found that the tree had miraculously been bent, such that it no longer endangered the church. The clergymen rejoiced that their church, Adnanitä ʿOm |sp|, would survive."
1028,"There was a church in Ethiopia where three priests resided, all of whom were serial adulterers. The Virgin Mary was aware of their sins, and she induced them to confess. On the day of Bǝrhan |sp| the people of the country gathered in the church for Mass. While the priests were still in the betä lǝḥem |sp| (""house of bread;"" i.e., the building where the Eucharist is prepared), they decided that if the people were unable to name their deeds, then they would excommunicate them. The priests announced their ultimatum, and the people, who knew of the priests’ sins, responded by calling out their adultery. Upon hearing this answer, the priests refused to celebrate Mass, and they buried the Eucharist in the ground. Astonished, the people brought the priests before the metropolitan, Abunä Marqos |sp|, who immediately demoted the priests. He also severely chastised the people for allowing known sinners to perform the Mass. After the people returned home to reconsecrate their church, a thunderbolt came down on the shrine, throwing the clergy to the ground and displacing the Eucharist. When the clergy found the Eucharist, they also discovered the Eucharist the sinful priests had buried. The Virgin Mary put it into their mind to bring the buried Eucharist to the metropolitan, who broke it into three pieces, keeping two pieces and returning the third."
1029,"There was an abbot who devoted himself wholly to the Virgin Mary. For his bed covering he used a goat skin, under which there was an infestation of bugs. The abbot was embarrassed by his situation and did not want to mention it to the other monks. So he prayed to Mary instead, asking her to send him birds to deal with his bug problem. Birds immediately appeared."
1030,"There was a monk who lived in a cell near the church of Our Holy Lady. Above the church there stood a great cliff, at the top of which was a remote farm field where the monk’s disciples worked. The disciples were pious, and the Virgin Mary, who cared for them deeply, wished to give them respite from their toil up and down the treacherous path to the clifftop. For this reason she made them angels of God and gave them wings, which they used to fly effortlessly to and from the clifftop field. One day, the enemy (i.e., Satan) inspired one of the monks with a love of money. While working in the field this monk found a needle and decided to keep it from his brothers. That evening, when the other disciples flew down from the farm, the monk with the needle stayed on the cliff. The other disciples asked him why he refused to come down, and the monk admitted his disgrace. He prayed to Mary for forgiveness, and he asked her to restore him to the angelic status from which he had fallen. The other disciples echoed his prayers, which Mary granted."
1031,"In the country of Śämro |sp|, there was a priest who served in the Virgin Mary’s church. This priest was also a skilled carpenter, and for his carpentry he cut down many trees. Mary, who did not approve of the priest cutting down her trees, asked him to stop. But the priest refused. Next, Mary asked the people of Śämro to stop the priest, but he refused to listen to them as well. To admonish the priest, Mary started to make his tools disappear. Nevertheless, the priest persisted in his work, encouraging others to cut down trees for him. Seeing this, Mary began to burn down any house constructed with trees from her precinct. But this action had the effect of hardening not just the priest’s heart, but also the hearts of people in the community. Mary responded to their stubbornness by declaring that the priest must not live in her country, nor would he be buried there. The priest left, and when he died he was buried outside the fence of the church."
1032,"There was a monk named Timona |sp|, to whom Jesus revealed His disappointment in a man named Mäbaʾa Ṣǝyon |sp|. Jesus had spat on Mäbaʾa Ṣǝyon’s clothes so that He, through His spittle, would remain close to the man. But Mäbaʾa Ṣǝyon had lent his clothes to others, thwarting Jesus’s plan. Timona called Mäbaʾa Ṣǝyon and asked why he lent his clothing to others. Mäbaʾa Ṣǝyon claimed that people forced him to give him his clothes. He expressed worry about disappointing Jesus, but Timona brought peace by suggesting that they pray together for His mercy. The Virgin Mary then approached Timona with a worry of her own, explaining how upset she felt when people chewed on the flesh of her Son. Timona asked what the people should do instead, given that Jesus had told them, “Eat my flesh.” Mary responded that the people should not chew the flesh, but rather knead it between tongue and palate. Timona suggested that the priests should make the Eucharist softer and easier to knead in the mouth. That way, if people chewed the flesh it would be a sin of the laity rather than a sin of the clergy."
1033,"Maḫdärä Krǝsto |sp| was a monk who lived at Däbrä Zämäddo |sp| and who loyally served the Virgin Mary. The people of Däbrä Zämäddo appointed Maḫdärä Krǝsto as their new abbot, and he ably upheld the church’s orders and laws. But there came a day when Maḫdärä Krǝsto decided to step down from his office. When the people begged him to stay, he responded: “when the time in office is prolonged, negligence will prevail.” As Maḫdärä Krǝsto grew old and began to prepare his grave far from the church, the Virgin Mary sent a messenger to ask him why he dug outside the shrine. Maḫdärä Krǝsto, who believed himself a sinner, asked why he should be buried in the shrine. But the messenger promised that the monk would have his final rest there. After Maḫdärä Krǝsto finished his labors, he went on to live for many years with a childlike innocence. When he died, other monks brought his body to the shrine and, at Mary’s direction, buried him to the right of the altar."
1034,"Mäbaʾa Ṣǝyon |sp| lived in Śǝmrätä Ab |sp|. One day, a woman came to Mäbaʾa Ṣǝyon and asked him to take her baby as a servant. Mäbaʾa Ṣǝyon reluctantly accepted this child, who was very sick and vomited what looked like charcoal and scorpions. One night, after the child had recovered from his illness, there was a terrible fire. The adults escaped the house, but two children remained inside, including the child Mäbaʾa Ṣǝyon had taken on as a servant. The next morning, the people of the country found that though one child had burned to ash, Mäbaʾa Ṣǝyon’s servant had miraculously survived thanks to the Virgin Mary. Elsewhere in the same country there was a beautiful church surrounded by tall trees. The trees blocked the sun in the dry season, and in the wet season they dripped water and shed leaves onto the church, eroding its walls. The people did not want to upset Mary by cutting the trees down, so they left them alone. But Mary, who loved her people, caused a fire to burn down the offending trees. The fire grew so intense that the people worried it would destroy the church as well. But when the fire cleared they found the church still standing, with its thatch roof miraculously intact."
1035,"There was a man who lived in Wägrä Sǝḫin |sp|, the city of the saints. Although this man was a Christian in name, in his deeds he strayed from Christian law. Indeed, he followed the lead of the Arämi |sp|, refusing to fast, pray, or obey the clergy. He mock the Christian religion and demanded that holy day be abolished. On the third day of Gənbot, a holy day for the Virgin Mary, the man went to plow the field. At three o’clock a storm suddenly descended and the earth opened up, swallowing the man along with his oxen."
1036,"A certain greedy man lived between the two Mount Sǝḫins |sp|. He made a lot of money through farming and the relentless acquisition of new land to cultivate. This man never made any offerings to the church. He also refused to observe holy days, and instead spent his time sowing his fields. One year, when his crop was ready to harvest, the Virgin Mary sent a swarm of locusts. The locusts did not touch any other person’s field, but they did completely decimate this man’s crop. This man also lost all his money, his cattle did not return from the fields, and then his wife died. The man remained lonely and poor into old age, just as Mary had intended."
1037,"There was a monk named Wäldä Ḥawarya |sp|, who came from Däbrä Libanos |sp| but now lived in Däbrä Zämäddo |sp|. He was a good Christian, and he understood the scriptures well. One day, he went to the chapel of the icon of the Virgin Mary to grieve the crucifixion of her Son. Whenever Wäldä Ḥawarya thought of the crucifixion he would grow weak, and tears would stream from his eyes. One day Mary visited Wäldä Ḥawarya while he was in such a state, and she asked him why he shed so many tears. He told her it happened whenever he thought about the Son of God’s suffering. Mary responded: “Was my Son crucified for you only? Was he not crucified for the whole world?” Then she left."
1038,"Wäldä Ḥawaryat |sp| was a loyal follower of the Virgin Mary. But whereas he read the Maḫletä Ṣǝge |sp| in silence, the other clergy loved to sing it. One day Mary came to Wäldä Ḥawaryat and informed him that she would go to the other clergy and strengthen them against exhaustion. Wäldä Ḥawaryat asked why Mary would not offer him strength as well. Mary replied that the other clergy needed it more, since when they performed the Maḫlet |sp|, they sang and danced strenuously. When Mary left to attend to the other clergy, Wäldä Ḥawaryat followed her and watched as she handed them instruments and wiped their sweating faces. After witnessing this miracle, Wäldä Ḥawaryat decided it was better to sing and dance the Maḫlet with others rather than read it silently, alone."
1039,"One day, a thief stole a lectern from Däbrä Zämäddo |sp| and brought it to Maḫdärä Krǝstos |sp|, the ruler of Ṭäṭära |sp|. Maḫdärä Krǝstos thought the lectern was beautiful, and he paid the thief a large sum for it. In his happiness, the ruler summoned the people of his household to view his purchase. But when a young man named Täklä Haymanot |sp| saw the lectern, he knew it rightfully belonged to the Virgin Mary of Däbrä Zämäddo. Hearing this, Maḫdärä Krǝstos confronted the thief, who in turn admitted his crime. The ruler then commanded the thief to return the stolen lectern to Däbrä Zämäddo, accompanied by Täklä Haymanot as an escort. When the two came to the land of Wäsan |sp|, the thief attempted to flee. But Täklä Haymanot threw his spear at the thief’s legs, and the man fell down. Täklä Haymanot then brought the thief before Abunä Ṣama Iyyäsus |sp|. The people wanted to execute or maim the thief, but the abbot decided to let him go so that the Virgin Mary could do with him as she wished."
1040,"King Lalibäla |sp| was the godfather of his brother’s son. When the child was three, Lalibäla separated him from his mother’s bosom and took him into his care. After this, the child stopped eating anything except for earth, which he only consumed on the Sabbath. The people of the country thought the boy looked healthy and beautiful, so they assumed he ate and drank whatever he wanted. Only Lalibäla knew of his godson’s secret fasting. One day, while the boy was sleeping near his spiritual father, Lalibäla noticed a goat tether tied around his waist. Seeing this, and reflecting on his godson’s torment, Lalibäla began to weep. At that moment the Virgin Mary appeared and spoke to Lalibäla. She explained that righteous individuals like his godson find the Kingdom of Heaven by refusing to be subservient to food and drink. Comforted by Mary’s words, Lalibäla abandoned his sorrow."
1041,"When Näʾakkwǝto Läʾab |sp| was a child, the Virgin Mary came to him and shared a prophecy about his future. According to this prophecy, his father, King Lalibäla, would give him the kingship then take it back again. Mary encouraged Näʾakkwǝto Läʾab to avoid anger and remain patient, as his father would eventually return the kingship to him. She then told him that once he became king he would go hunting in the country of Dänsa, where he would witness a white partridge enter a grotto. She explained that he must follow the partridge, catch it, and slaughter it. He must then sprinkle its blood in the grotto, bury its body there, and build a church in her name on the site. Everything that Mary prophesied came to pass, and Näʾakkwǝto Läʾab followed her instructions closely. The Son of Mary then sent a message to Näʾakkwǝto Läʾab declaring that his wife would be blessed with a child. Näʾakkwǝto Läʾab worried about losing his priesthood, and his wife worried about losing her virginity. But Mary reassured him that he would not lose his priesthood and that his wife would not lose her virginity."
1042,"There was a monk named Bäkwrä Ṣǝyon |sp| who planned to take hermitage with four other monks. These monks were familiar with a story that told of how Mary fled from Egypt and went to Ethiopia, where she stayed in a cell for seven months with her Son and Joseph. Inspired by Mary, Bäkwrä Ṣǝyon and the other monks planned to live in this same cell for five years. They had no food and no company, since the cell was in the desert. After five years of toil, the enemy (i.e., Satan) influenced some of the monks to consider leaving. But Bäkwrä Ṣǝyon declared that he would wait in the cell until he received Mary’s blessing. The other monks set off into the desert. The next morning Mary appeared in the cell and told Bäkwrä Ṣǝyon he must go to King Lalibäla’s country, for his grave would be located there. He followed Mary’s instructions, and when he died he was buried in the church of Mädḫane ʿAläm |sp|. Meanwhile, the other monks searched the desert for a miracle, but in vain."
1043,"King Zärʾa Yaʿǝqob |sp| entered a church that was built for the Virgin Mary. As he stood before her tabot to pray, he leaned against a column. Upset with his disrespectful behavior, Mary admonished the king with the words: “Do not press on me!” Mary, who possesses the power to speak through objects, went on to explain why it was disrespectful to lean against walls or columns in church. This story of Mary rebuking Zärʾa Yaʿǝqob clarifies why Lalibäla avoided using columns in any of the ten churches he constructed during his reign as king."
1044,"One night, an enemy pretended to be a boy who lived in Qwǝrbanä’s |sp| household. The enemy was actually an Arämi |sp|, and he convinced Qwǝrbanä to go to the church for the New Year. The enemy led Qwǝrbanä by torchlight. While they were walking, they came upon a fork in the path. Qwǝrbanä suggested taking the path on the right, but the enemy did not want people to see them, so he insisted on going to the left and entering the shrine by the betä lǝḥem |sp| (""house of bread;"" i.e., the building where the Eucharist is prepared. When they stood above the church, Qwǝrbanä realized that the enemy’s presence had caused him to forget how to recite the Mystagogia |sp|. He tried to say the words, but the enemy struck him with an iron stick and threw him into the water that coursed down to the church. Qwǝrbanä was swept away by the water, and his body slammed down next to the church with a loud crash audible to the monks in the shrine. Just then the Virgin Mary appeared. She told Qwǝrbanä not to worry, then touched his body and healed him of the injuries caused by his fall."
1045,"There was a group of loyal Christians who lived in Däbrä Zämäddo |sp|. They knew of nothing except prayer and worship. Neither the men nor the women knew how to do any manual labor, and they would not search for food and clothes. They contemplated leaving at times, but they always agreed that it would be better for them to die in Däbrä Zämäddo than to leave. The Virgin Mary appreciated their determination and loyalty, so she called to them with her own voice. She told the people of Däbrä Zämäddo that “both market places are not to be found,” and she repeated that phrase several times. The people of Däbrä Zämäddo comprehended the meaning of the phrase. They embraced their poverty and fasted in Mary’s honor."
1046,"During the time when Fäqadä Krǝstos |sp| served as abbot, there was a period when animals wreaked havoc in the chapel of Täklä Haymanot |sp|. Every night the priests and monks would close the chapel doors, and in the morning they would remain closed. But inside, they would find that a tomb had been opened, and that the human remains had been taken away to be eaten. A monk named Säfane Krǝstos |sp| informed his brothers that he had recently seen a leopard leave the shrine and leap over Täklä Haymanot. Abunä Fäqadä Krǝstos decided that the entire community should pray for Mary to help relieve their distress. He recited the prayer “Sälamä Gabrǝʾel mälʾak” |sp|, and he instructed the community to continue reciting it for seven days. On the third day of prayer, the people saw the leopard walking around the church. And on the fourth day, the monks found the leopard dead inside the chapel of Ignatius."
1047,"In Śǝmrätä Ab |sp| there lived a woman named Wälättä Nǝgǝśt |sp|, who loved the Virgin Mary and loyally attended a church built in her name. One day Wälättä Nǝgǝśt told Mary that she needed to move to another country. She asked Mary to accompany her on this journey and keep her safe. Unbeknownst to Wälättä Nǝgǝśt, the new country was located right next to an Arämi community. A few days after she arrived she went out to work the harvest in the farm fields. As she and other Christians were harvesting, the Arämi came. The others fled, but Wälättä Nǝgǝśt could not run, so she remained with her cattle. The Arämi took the cows as booty, but when they tried to take Wälättä Nǝgǝśt captive as well, Mary prevented them. The Arämi repeatedly returned to the field to capture Wälättä Nǝgǝśt, but they never succeeded and finally gave up. Thus was Wälättä Nǝgǝśt safe in her new country, and when she eventually returned to Śǝmrätä Ab she told the people there all about what Mary had done for her."
1048,"When Wäldä Yoḥannǝs |sp| (later known as Abunä Sinodos |sp|) was named the new keeper of the law at Däbrä Zämäddo |sp|, he noticed that water poured into the grotto and endangered the church. He decided to pave the mouth of the grotto and divert the water’s flow, and he went in search of materials for this purpose. Some people informed him of a large hab tree standing on top of the mountain, so he went there to cut it down. But when Wäldä Yoḥannǝs arrived, people had gathered there to tell him that he would have to kill them first if he wanted to fell the tree. In sadness he returned home, where he prayed to the Virgin Mary. He said the people of the country were crooked, and he wondered why they would not let the tree be cut down to benefit Mary’s church. Mary heard Wäldä Yoḥannǝs’s words, and she spent three days in silence. After observing the people’s stubbornness and lack of humility she split the tree into three parts. With the tree destroyed, the people allowed Wäldä Yoḥannǝs to use the wood. Mary moved the tree from the mountaintop to the grotto. But Wäldä Yoḥannǝs realized that the wood pieces were unusable, as they had not been cut peacefully."
1049,"In Śǝmrätä Ab |sp| there was a woman who loved the Virgin Mary and worked at her church. The clergy gave this woman a support stick, which they called “the stick of the woman.” The woman wanted to go to the place of the saints to pray, and she asked Mary for a sign that she should go. The next day she found her stick outside the church. She asked those in the clergy if they had moved it, and they said they had not. It happened again the next day, and the clergy again said they had not moved it. The woman took a priest aside and told him about her desire to go to the place of the saints. He told her to take her stick and go where she intended. When the woman arrived there, Mary appeared to her. She said there were two distressed people in that country, and that the woman must tell them that Mary would mitigate their distress. The woman did as Mary instructed, but the two distressed people were skeptical. Soon after, Mary appeared before one of these people and, after commanding him to believe what the woman had told him, she relieved his distress."
66,"A priest named John, who lived in the monastery of Saint Macarius, received frequent visits from the Virgin Mary. One day John was in his cell with two other monks, when he saw a bright light. He witnessed an image of Mary with wings like an eagle. She spread her wings over John, and the other monks were filled with wonder."
69,"King Mareqos |sp| ruled over Romeya |sp| (Rome) for ten years in peace and purity. He was a virgin who abstained both from women and from evil thoughts, and his people loved him endlessly. But one day they came to him and made a request. They wanted him to marry a woman so that their kingdom could be stronger. King Mareqos was troubled and told them that he would have to pray on the matter. He went before an icon of the Virgin Mary to profess his uncertainty about taking a wife. When King Mareqos finished speaking, the icon emitted a bright light and Mary spoke. She told him to remain firm in his resolve to retain his virginity and to go the desert, where he could live in the monastery of Tormâq |sp| and become one of her sons. After Mary finished speaking, King Mareqos left the palace disguised in rags and was never seen there again."
70,"Following the abrupt departure of King Mareqos |sp|, the people of Romeya |sp| (Rome) tried to locate him, but they only found his royal garb, his crown, and a letter. They took the letter to patriarch, Abbâ Dionysius |sp|, and presented it to him. The patriarch told the people to leave him and return the next day. When they left, Abbâ Dionysius prayed for the Virgin Mary to reveal King Mareqos’s whereabouts. Mary advised him not to look for the king, since he had gone in search of the Kingdom of Heaven. But she also promised that God would soon install a worthy new leader named Jeremiah. Abbâ Dionysius related this information to the people of Romeya, and they rejoiced."
74,"The wife of a pagan official came to Rome on the night of the Resurrection and wanted to pray at the Holy Sepulcher. As the woman approached the tomb, the Virgin Mary appeared and prevented her from entering, stating that she was a heretic who was not wholly faithful. Immediately upon hearing Mary’s words, the woman’s faith became complete, and she received the body and blood of Christ. The woman then freely entered the tomb."
80,"In the year 1112, monks traveled to the monastery of Qʷəsqʷam |sp| for the week of the Passion. Abbâ Gabriel, recently appointed bishop at Qousyâ |sp|, was traveling from Cairo when he crossed paths with the monks. The monks invited him to celebrate Holy Week with them, and he agreed. Upon arrival, Gabriel climbed to the chapel and remained there from Monday to Thursday with no food or drink. Abbâ Michael, the abbot at v, asked Gabriel to descend and wash the feet of the poor, but Gabriel insisted on remaining. Just then, the Virgin Mary appeared above the altar and gestured for Gabriel to descend. Mary remained visible to all until Gabriel had washed the feet of all the poor. Gabriel then returned to the chapel and remained there until Easter, when the monks came and asked him to give the people Communion. Gabriel worried that the patriarch would be upset to learn of how he had remained in Däbrä Qʷəsqʷam without permission, but the monks dispelled his fears and he descended. At the moment of the consecration, Mary appeared to Gabriel and promised him eternal life. Gabriel then returned to the chapel, and when Abbâ Michael opened the door the next morning, he found Gabriel prostrated before an icon of Mary, dead. The monks buried him, and his tomb remains famous."
81,"In the year 1038, Abbâ John went with a group of monks to the monastery of Saint Anthony in Manfalout |sp|. John suggested they go to Däbrä Qʷəsqʷam |sp| to celebrate the Feast of the Twelve Apostles on the fifth day of Ḥamle. The day after they arrived, a Muslim named Katib |sp| came and demanded Abbâ Gabriel to give him fifty dinars. When Gabriel responded that the monastery had no money, Katib struck the abbot in the head with a stick. Abbâ John chastised Katib for his shameful actions, and the Muslim departed in anger. On his way, Katib stole five camels loaded with wheat, as well as five cows full of milk. Abbâ Gabriel told Abbâ John they should pray to the Virgin Mary for her help. That night, those in the monastery saw a fire burning in the distance. The next morning a man arrived at Däbrä Qʷəsqʷam with the stolen camels and cows in tow. Abbâ Gabriel asked what had happened, and the man explained that he and his neighbors had all woken with the idea of killing their enemy, Katib. They set fire to the Muslim man’s home, killing him and his entire family. Then a woman’s voice informed them that the livestock belonged to Däbrä Qʷəsqʷam. They knew the voice belonged to the Virgin Mary."

After Zeno became emperor of Rome, Constantinople, and the borders of Egypt, he contemplated the many famous structures Constantine had built in Jerusalem. Zeno then learned that many distinguished saints lived in the desert of Scete, but that no churches existed there. Spurred by the Holy Spirit, Zeno ordered that four churches be built in the name of the Virgin Mary. One of the churches was constructed in the convent of Saint Macarius |sp|. This large church was adorned with beautiful ornaments, had an icon of the Virgin Mary, and featured elaborately painted walls. Abbâ Benjamin, the patriarch of Alexandria, was called to consecrate the church, which he did on the eighth day of Ṭərr |sp|, a Sunday. As he made the sign of the Cross with the chrism, Abbâ Benjamin saw a vision of Jesus Christ, the Virgin Mary, and the angels, all making the sign of the Cross as well. The vision startled Abbâ Benjamin, but a voice told him not to fear. Abbâ Benjamin then a vision of a holy man in the church, and an angel identified the man as Saint Macarius. Abbâ Benjamin prostrated before the saint and exalted the Virgin Mary.

One day a priest traveled to the church built in the convent of Saint Macarius. The priest went before the icon of the Virgin Mary, and the icon spoke to him, saying: “Do not hurry!” The priest placed his hand on a column, and an outline of his handprint remained visible there ever after. Abbâ Benjamin performed rites for the feast of the Epiphany. Then he returned to Alexandria and wrote to Emperor Zeno, telling him of the wonders he had seen in Scete. Upon hearing Abbâ Benjamin’s news, Zeno’s daughter, Ilaria, left court and went to live in a monastery in the desert. From then on, Zeno granted annuities to maintain the monasteries and churches of Scete, and to provide sustenance for the monks who lived there.

During their flight from Egypt the Holy Family stopped in Metmaq |sp|, and the Virgin Mary blessed the place. From there they proceeded to Cairo, and from the road Mary turned to the east and saw the desert of Scete. She blessed this land as well, and her Son said that those who lived in the desert would be particularly devoted to her. Later, Jesus appeared before Abraham, who lived near Scete, and informed him that he had been chosen to sow the seed of generations. Abraham’s wife became pregnant and gave birth to a son named Macarius. Macarius became a deacon, and though his parents gave him a wife, he chose to remain a virgin. One day he went into the desert of Scete to buy salt, and while he slept there an angel visited him and told him of the desert’s great future. Later, while Macarius was giving mass, an angel came and carried him away to Scete. After that, Macarius went to Saint Anthony, who blessed him and told him a prophecy about Scete’s future. Macarius then returned to Scete and remained there. By the time he died, at one hundred ten years old, five thousand monks lived in the desert."

97,"There were two close friends: a prefect and a priest. On the day of the Virgin Mary’s festival, the priest wanted to chant praises for the Holy Mother with the other monks. But the prefect, who worried that there would not be enough time to perform the Eucharist, prevented them from singing. At that moment, a thought came to the prefect’s mind, warning him that his refusal may irritate Mary. He told the priest of his thought, and the priest responded by telling of an event that occurred at another church he attended before becoming a monk. One day the monks at this church burst into songs of praise for Mary at the top of their voices, but when the abbot heart the sound he commanded them to stop singing. One monk told the abbot that the Virgin Mary removed him from his duty because he made her chant cease. The abbot immediately abandoned his duties, and for three days the monks at the church tried to convince their superior to stay. At the end of that period the abbot still refused to resume his duties, and a new abbot was nominated in his place."

Her mother implored Mary to help. One night, while sleeping, the woman saw a vision of Mary walking in the air above the river, accompanied by angels. Seeing this, the woman threw her daughter out the window and called for Mary to take her. An angel brought the girl to Mary, who cured her blindness by touching her eyes. The angel then returned the girl to her mother. At this moment the woman woke up and cried out that her daughter had been cured. She and her stepmother woke the girl.

There she encountered a scorpion, and she ate it. The scorpion’s poison spread rapidly through her body. Thinking she lay close to death, the woman asked the people in her community to bring her the icon of the Virgin Mary that she kept in her home. This woman had always loved Mary, and with the beloved icon in her hands she submitted herself to the Holy Virgin, begging for her help. At that moment, a voice came from the icon. The voice instructed the woman to find a priest named John and confess her sins to him. The woman did as Mary commanded, and the priest recited a prayer to remove the demon that was upon her.

At the end of the day the monk returned home, but just as he reached his house a mad dog attacked him. Once again the shining lady appeared, and after driving the dog away she led the monk inside, tucked him into bed, and signed the Cross over him.

It came to pass that he grew ill after fasting all day and standing all night. He could not go to church, nor could he walk. When his illness drew him near death, he asked his fellow monks to carry him to the church so he could kiss the tabernacle of the altar. The monks did as he asked.

Among the people on board there was a man who loved the Virgin Mary, and he cursed those who failed to call on the Holy Virgin for help. Following his reproach, all of the passengers prayed to Mary.

One day, while he slept, the man dreamt of a grand church with an east-facing window. A fire burned outside the window. A small bird whose color resembled the heavens flew out of the window and, batting its wings, extinguished the fire. When it reentered the church the fire broke out again, so the bird flew out of the window and extinguished the fire once more. The bird then descended to the ground, turning white in the process. And as the rich man approached to see the bird up close, it disappeared. The man realized that Mary had taken the form of the bird, and that the act of extinguishing the fire represented the quelling of the plague. He gave thanks to Christ and the Holy Virgin for delivering him and his people."
280,"In Ethiopia, King of Zärˀa Yaˁəqob |sp| expelled a monk from his court for refusing to venerate the Virgin Mary. Despite his expulsion, he had many followers in the land, who also refused to venerate Mary. The people demanded their king to condemn these rebels to death, but Zärˀa Yaˁəqob had their noses and tongues removed instead. At that time, three envoys of Abbâ Mattewos |sp|, the Patriarch of Alexandria, were at court. Zärˀa Yaˁəqob ordered these envoys to judge the rebels, and after speaking with them, the envoys decided that the blasphemers must be executed. The king assented, and the rebels were stoned to death. Thirty-eight days later, on the feast of the Cross of Christ, a mysterious light began to shine on the king’s enclosures. This light, which was bright like fire but did not burn, also shone in the churches and emanated from people’s clothing. Some days prior to this event, a monk had left court to visit his home country. Wishing this monk could see the miraculous light, Zärˀa Yaˁəqob sent messengers to recall him to court.

One day, a monk asked to borrow one of their fine pieces of clothing for a festival ceremony. The priests agreed. But when they saw the monk dressed in their finery, the priests grew contemptuous of their own fondness for luxury. They decided to seek out a humbler lifestyle in the countryside. They traveled to another monastery, where they performed physically vigorous labor: one worked at the millstone, another chopped wood, and the third carried water to the monastery. One day the priests heard a voice informing them that the abbot at their old monastery wanted them to come back. On their return trip they passed through a wadi, where they encountered a snake.

But the abbess never left the monastery unguarded, and the merchant realized he would never be able to steal the icon. For this reason, he took his knife, reached through the gate, and cut away just a portion of the icon. When he did this the icon began bleeding profusely. The merchant hid himself, but the people soon found him and, in their fury, wanted to kill him.

Knowing of their doubt, Mary reached her hand out and shook the kerchief three times before letting it go. The same woman who had thrown the kerchief caught it and stuffed it into her clothing. She then dropped to hands and knees and began to crawl away from the crowd, fearful that others would try to steal the kerchief from her. Seeing the woman crawl, others converged around her and began to beat her. The crowd severely injured the woman, causing her limbs to swell and her head to bleed. Nonetheless, they did not manage to retrieve the kerchief. The bishop, who had witnessed the event, went to the woman and asked her to give him the kerchief. She did so, and he tore the kerchief in two. He have one half back to the woman.

The patriarch returned home victorious, but the general was upset. He complained to Mouizz that the Christians had no faith, citing a passage in the Gospel which declared that having faith “like a grain of mustard seed” could be powerful enough to move a mountain. Mouizz summoned the patriarch once more and asked him about this parable. When the patriarch confirmed its truth, the king asked him to prove it. The patriarch told the king to wait for three days. He gathered bishops and monks in Cairo’s church of the Virgin Mary, and for three days and nights they prayed for assistance. On the third day, Mary appeared and told them to find a man named Simon, who had plucked out his own eye in repentance for being seduced by a prostitute. The holy men found Simon, who instructed them to assemble on the side of a mountain, say “Kyrie eleison” forty-one times, then prostrate themselves three times as the patriarch made the sign of the Cross.

Thecla boarded the boat and offered the angels some of her food provisions, which they accepted and appeared to eat. In the evening, the two women grew sad, and Thecla asked what grieved them. The two women explained that each of their sons had been killed. Mary then said that they were going to Alexandria for the wedding of Abbâ Esi. Thecla identified herself as Abbâ Esi’s sister, but those aboard the boat already knew who she was. As night fell, Thecla saw the ship emit a brilliant light, and she expressed her astonishment as to how the ship moved without any external impetus. Mary answered with a story about how Jesus Christ had once calmed an agitated sea. Just then, the ship arrived in Alexandria."

At the end of this period the Virgin Mary appeared to him, shining with unspeakable glory. Abbâ Behor prostrated before her, but Mary lifted him and commended him for being a loyal servant of God. Abbâ Behor then saw in the sky a vision of forty animals drawing a great chariot of light, in which Christ reigned. From his chariot, Christ commanded Abbâ Behor to strengthen his heart against the evil in the world.

After he prayed and the winds calmed, those aboard saw a white dove circled the boat three times before flying off in the direction from whence it came. The boat then began to move in the same direction, as if the bird were tugging it along. Some of the disciples took this as a sign that God had saved them, by grace of the Virgin Mary."

She had everyone drink a sweet liquid from a goblet. This man also wanted to drink, but an angel who stood by Mary’s side called him lazy and said he did not deserve it. Even so, the man exulted in the act of singing God’s praises. The seraphim also sang praises to God, without rest. The chanting of the priests could be heard from far away, and their voices filled the mountains. By Mary’s grace, God rewarded them all."

King Achraf asked if Mary truly appeared at the monastery, and the Muslims confirmed that she appeared alongside an assembly of angels and martyrs. They also told how Mary once threw a handkerchief, and Abbâ Michael used the blessed object to seduce newcomers to the faith. After listening to this story, King Achraf ordered Däbrä Metmaq to be demolished. The Christians offered the Muslims gold to prevent the destruction of their holy church, but the Muslims refused and destroyed it anyway.

The monks commanded Satan to perform several tasks, which they were surprised to see him perform. He cleaned the dust from the oven, ground grain, and moved a massive tree that even two hundred men could not carry. One day the monks them commanded Satan to bring them fish, and he returned with a whale along with an entire merchant ship.

The monk explained his desire to learn the Scriptures, and that he wished to drink from the cup of knowledge.

He proclaimed that He would escort her to Heaven, where she would rest peacefully for all eternity. He also promised that all sadness, fear, or discomfort Mary had experienced on earth would no longer afflict her."
435,"One day, as Mary traveled from Nazareth to draw water from the cistern in the city of David, God sent the archangel Gabriel to her. Gabriel spoke, telling Mary that God had blessed her. Mary looked around to see who had spoken, and when she saw no one there she became afraid and fled, leaving her jug behind. Gabriel came to Mary again when she was at home, knitting purple thread. The archangel told her not to fear, and he explained that she had been made pregnant by the power of God and the Holy Spirit. Mary asked how she could be pregnant, since she had not known any man. Gabriel clarified that she was not pregnant in the usual way; she carried in her womb the Son of God, whose name would be Jesus and who would save people from their sins. In response to these words, Mary released herself to God’s will."
614,"After their prayer, the apostles decided to write down all they had seen that related to the Virgin Mary’s transmigration from the world in the year 345. The apostles also decided that the people should commemorate Mary three times a year. The first day of her commemoration would be the day after the Nativity, since on that day those who celebrated Christ’s birth were saved from locusts, and fields of grain were blessed. The second day of her commemoration would occur in the month of Ayar |sp| [Ayyyar? Iyar?], when neither birds nor insects eat the fruit of the earth or lay waste to the land. The third day of her commemoration would be held on the seventeenth day of Nähase |sp|, the month when the fields bear forth their fruits. The apostles ordered the people to commemorate Mary by bringing offerings of flour and wheat to the church. They also ordered the priests to pray, and they asked Mary to listen to the priests’ prayers, accept all sacrifices offered in her name, and to bless those who have faith in the Eucharist."
617,"The magistrates and temple priests came to Bethlehem and asked those who had been healed by the Virgin Mary to tell their story. The people explained that Mary had prayed over them, and that all of them had been healed from their illnesses. Dismayed, the magistrates declared that Mary must be expelled from Bethlehem. But the next day, when a group of men when to arrest Mary’s disciples, a light beamed down from Heaven and transported them back to where the magistrates waited. The governor then gathered thirty soldiers and went to arrest Mary. As they set out, the Holy Spirit appeared and transported Mary and her disciples to safety in Jerusalem. Upon finding Mary’s home empty, the governor became furious and ordered the inhabitants of Bethlehem to come to Jerusalem and explain what had happened. The priests chastised the people for not knowing the disciples had laid a trap, then again ordered the people to find and arrest the fugitives. Five days later, the citizens of Jerusalem witnessed angels enter Mary’s home and sing hymns. A group of men took up torches and went to burn Mary’s house down. But when they arrived an angel locked the men in the house and left them to die in the fire. Seeing this miracle, the governor pledged his faith in Jesus Christ and His mother, Mary."
618,"The day after he had witnessed men die while attempting to burn down the Virgin Mary’s house, the governor gathered the Jews to express his belief in Christ and rebuke them for having crucified the Son of God. A man of faith named Caleb came forward and counselled the governor to have those assembled declare whether they believed in Mary’s virgin birth of Christ. The governor issued the command, and the crowd divided itself into two camps: believers and infidels. There followed an extended exchange between the two groups as they argued over Christ’s divine status. After listening to this exchange, the governor ordered the infidels to be whipped. That evening the governor and his sons approached Mary’s home. The governor asked for an audience with Mary, and the Holy Virgin welcomed him in. Upon entering the home, the governor wept joyfully and pledged his devotion to Mary. He asked her to heal his son’s illness, to bless the city of Rome, and to save him upon his death. Mary blessed the governor and invited him to sit. But when he looked up and saw the apostles there, he prostrated again and greeted them with blessings. The apostles blessed the governor, and the man’s ill son was instantly healed. The governor then returned to Rome, where he proclaimed all he had seen."
619,"At daybreak the Holy Spirit told the Apostles to lead Our Lady Mary from Jerusalem to a certain place with three caves. The Apostles were then to install Mary in a bed there and to pray over her until the following dawn. After the Apostles ushered stole away with their charge, many Jews approached Tafonya |sp| and proposed that he should kill Mary and burn her body. But just as Tafonya prepared to commit the act, an angel of the Lord appeared and cut off his arms with a burning sword. Tafonya cried out and begged the Apostles for mercy. The Apostles told Tafonya to pray to Mary, which he did. Upon hearing Tafonya’s prayer, Mary asked Peter to restore his arms. Peter healed Tafonya, then gave him a stick and commanded him to go forth and tell the Jews of all that Mary had done for him."
623,"The Lord said to Our Lady Mary that He would, as she requested, impart forgiveness to anyone who invoked her name. The Lord then commanded Peter to tell all the creatures of Heaven and Earth to sing psalms of exaltation. At that moment Mary’s spirit departed her body and ascended to Heaven. John closed her eyes, while Peter and Paul arranged her hands and feet. The Holy Spirit dressed her in brilliant light. The Apostles then lifted Mary and raised her to Paradise on twelve clouds of light. Anna, the mother of Mary, and Elisabeth, the mother of John the Baptist, appeared, as did many others: Adam, Seth, Noah, Shem, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Enoch, Elijah, and Moses, and after them the chariots of our Lord Jesus Christ. And when the Apostles had lain Mary down in Paradise, everyone returned to their dwellings. Finally, the Apostles went to Mount Sinai and prayed to Christ, who had bestowed upon them the power to judge those from the twelve tribes of Israel who did not believe in Him or His mother."
62,"There was a great Christian country whose inhabitants devoted themselves to the Virgin Mary. They prayed to her night and day, observed all her feast days, and rejoiced in hearing of her miracles. For this reason, the king arranged to have the Book of Miracles of Our Lady dispatched to all the churches in his country. But one abbot, upon hearing of the king’s action, refused to allow the Book of Miracles into his church. When a monk asked him why not, the abbot explained his fear that his disciples would abandon their rigorous practices of religious observance if they heard stories about how Mary forgave people their sins. But Mary did not approve of the abbot’s reasoning, and five months later, while traveling with some monks, the abbot died suddenly while giving a speech. The other monks were terrified and wondered what the abbot’s death meant."
350,"In the church of the Romans there was an effigy of the Virgin Mary. People came from all over to see the effigy, but they followed the example of the Egyptians in neglecting to remove their shoes before approaching it. Following these bad habits, the Ethiopians remained shod while approaching the effigy. A voice came from the effigy, reproaching the Ethiopians for their disrespect. The Ethiopians promised never to wear shoes again when approaching an effigy of Mary, and from then on everyone—even the Egyptians—showed proper respect by removing their shoes."
352,"Many rich persons dwelled in a certain city where there stood a beautiful church constructed in the name of the Virgin Mary. The people of this city had many precious possessions, which they stored in the church. Mary did not like this situation, so she instructed a priest to tell the people to remove their belongings from her house. The priest spoke to the people, but they refused comply. When Mary learned of the people’s refusal, she became furious. On the first day of Gənbo people assembled to celebrate the Nativity of Our Lady Mary, and just as the priest began to distribute the Eucharist, a bolt of fire landed before the altar and set the church ablaze. Nearly everyone fled in fear. Only the priest and the deacon who had been officiating remained. When another member of the clergy encouraged them to flee as well, the priest encouraged the fearful one to remain strong in his faith. The three men then recited psalms together as fire consumed the church. But Mary guarded these three from harm, and when the flames finally cooled seven days later, none of the men smelled of fire. With the church burned down, the survivors abandoned those who had fled in fear and went together to Jerusalem."
392,"There was a severely paralytic man whose body was contorted such that he could neither walk nor crawl. When he heard that the sick could be healed at Makana Iyyasus |sp|, he was loaded onto a donkey and made the long journey there. He arrived in the month of Taḫśaś |sp|. He stayed in the church for two weeks, all the while praying to Christ and the Virgin Mary. On the Wednesday after taking Communion, a figure clothed in flame appeared before the paralytic man, raised him to Heaven, and healed him. The attendants grew afraid when they heard the paralytic man’s bones squeaking, and they went in to ask the man how he was doing. The paralytic man told the attendants how he had been healed by the greatness of Mary. Following the instructions that the fiery figure had given him in his vision, the paralytic man then traveled to the place where Abbâ Anbass was buried and established a monastery there in honor of Our Lady."
397,"One day the Virgin Mary appeared before a certain woman who loved her. Mary instructed the woman to journey to a nearby land and relate a message to the people there. Though the woman feared travel, she obeyed and set out under the Holy Virgin’s protection. The woman traveled to a land where the people were in the midst of observing Mary’s five feast days, from the twenty-first to the twenty-fifth of Gənbo |sp|. The people in this land had recently struggled with drought, but when they petitioned Mary for help, she had immediately sent rain. When the rain came, a neighboring community proposed sowing seeds together to prevent quarrels between the two groups. A religious man warned against doing anything before the holy days were over. But the neighboring community, which did not respect Mary, sowed during the five feast days anyway. Miraculously, the grain sprouted immediately. But before the bounty could be harvested, a storm destroyed the crop. The neighboring community looked upon the destruction with horror and repented for disrespecting Mary’s feast days. As for the community that honored the holiday, their harvest survived the storm. The traveling woman arrived at this time and informed the people that the Mary would always help them because of the honor they had shown her. After delivering Mary’s message, the woman returned home in peace."
398,"A monk named Entos |sp| came to the land of Bado |sp|, where monks from Däbrä Maryam |sp| led lives of strict observance at the side of a great mountain. Entos entered the temple to pray to the Virgin Mary, asking to serve as her attendant. The other monks welcomed Entos into their community and gave him a cell, where he observed a strict fast consisting only of water. One evening Satan came to Entos in disguise and asked to spend the night. Satan warmed the cold cell with a fire and tempted Entos with bread. Entos refused and went to sleep. At midnight Satan tried to strangle Entos, but Mary protected the monk from harm by hurling Satan over a cliff. Mary then instructed Entos to ask the other monks why they prepared the Eucharist with the soiled water that flowed from the top of the mountain. She instead showed him a place near his cell, and she told him that a spring would form there if he struck it three times with a stick. She also told him to plant vegetables there, and she ordered that only men should be allowed near the spring, lest it would disappear. When the other monks learned of this miracle, they praised Mary."
399,"A man went before an icon of the Virgin Mary to pray on behalf of his sick son. A few days after the man’s prayer, Mary answered his call by sending the child Qirqos |sp| to save the boy from death. Qirqos appeared to the boy bearing the sign of the Cross, and the evil spirits left immediately. The boy asked those attending him if they could see the same vision, but they could not. The boy described a bright and happy child calling himself Qirqos, who instructed him not to fear as he had been saved from death. The boy also described a procession of magnificently dressed holy men. When these men spoke, the boy felt his health restored. The boy’s attendants marveled at his words, and they glorified both God and Mary. When the boy invoked Mary’s name from his sickbed, she came escorted by Saint George of Lydda |sp|, who rode a white horse and carried a spear. Mary touched the boy, curing him of all illness. She then introduced Saint George and ordered the angels to build a rampart of fire to protect the boy from harmful spirits."
474,"Bishop Dexius (Hildephonsus) |sp| once witnessed sweat drip from an icon of Mary at the moment of Eucharistic consecration. Mary then spoke to the bishop, instructing him to make a young girl in the tomb rise from her grave, and to take her veil as an act of salvation for those who suffer. A man who learned of this miracle approached the bishop and told him how his son had been captured by an unconquerable demon. The bishop prayed to Mary, then he took the girl’s veil and cast it over the possessed child. The boy was immediately cured, and the people looked on in amazement. The veil went on to save seven thousand, nine hundred lives."
493,"The homily narrated here begins by recounting how God founded Zion and thereby caused the exodus of His people from servitude and bondage. God then addressed Moses and told him to ascend Mount Sinai. When Moses arrived at the summit, God instructed him to remove his sandals. He then gave Moses the Tablet of the Law, each side of which contained writing that God had inscribed in ink of fire. Upon giving Moses the Tablet, God explained that the writing thereupon established His covenant with all Israelites. God said this to Moses, knowing that in the womb of Mary, who is Zion and the Ark of the Law, would come the one who would save all the faithful, who are Israelites. God then said to Moses that he had given instructions for the construction of the Tabernacle to two wise men, Baslʾel |sp| and Elyab |sp|. Moses descended from Mount Sinai and told the two wise men to begin their work. Basl’el and Elyab built the Tabernacle with lavish materials. They also fashioned the Mercy Seat, which bore images of two Cherubim whose wings extended to protect the Ark. On the first day of the first month, Moses placed the Tablet of the Law inside the Ark and the Ark inside the Mercy Seat. He then concealed the Ark behind a purple curtain, and the Tabernacle was filled with the glory of God."
494-A,"The exhortation given here begins by identifying Our Lady Mary as the pure Ark in whose womb dwelt the Lord, who was incarnated from her. Likewise, the Ark of Zion carried the word of the Lord, inscribed on the Tablet of the Law. When the Israelites were on their way to Jericho, they needed to cross the River Jordan. The priests entered the river carrying the Ark, and as they reached the middle the water ceased to flow until all the Israelites had crossed. The children of Israel praised Mary for the rest of their journey to Jericho. Upon arriving there, the circled the city with the Ark, whereupon the walls of Jericho crumbled. With Mary’s help they destroyed the city and its people, burning everything but the golden vessels, which were saved for the house of the Lord. Following the destruction of Jericho, Mary went on to decimate Gay, as well as any other city whose people did not invoke the name of the Creator."
494-B,"The exhortation given here begins by identifying Our Lady Mary as the pure Ark in whose womb dwelt the Lord, who was incarnated from her.

Following the destruction of Jericho, Mary went on to decimate Gay, as well as any other city whose people did not invoke the name of the Creator."
495-A,"During his reign, King David assembled the youth of Israel in order to transport the Ark of Zion to the house of Aminadab |sp|. Aminadab’s son, Oza |sp|, led the way as David and the Israelites followed, singing songs to the Lord. When they arrived at the threshing floor, Oza raised his hand to take hold of the Ark. But touching the Ark was forbidden, and a cow immediately threw Oza to the ground, killing him. David mourned Oza’s death and prayed for the Lord to guide him to the place the Ark should dwell. Following his prayer, David traveled to the house of Abidara |sp| the Gittite. The Ark remained there for three months, blessing the entire household. At the end of this period, David, along with a company of many musicians, escorted the Ark to Israel. They arrived to the jubilant clamor of trumpets and installed the Ark in the Tabernacle. David then sacrificed cows and sheep for the Ark’s dedication. Meanwhile, David’s wife grew envious of her husband’s commitment to the Ark, and in her heart she rejected him. Her womb closed, and she without having children."
495-B,"King David wished to build a temple for the Ark of Zion. Speaking through the prophet Nathan, the Lord told David that his son, Solomon, would build the temple. The Lord promised to establish a covenant with Solomon when he eventually succeeded David as king, and to treat him with mercy so long as he abided by the law of Moses."
496-A,"In the fourth year of his reign, King Solomon ordered workers to assemble large and precious stones, which his own sons, alongside the sons of King Hiram |sp|, hewed into shape. Solomon then had a temple built in the month of Nisan |sp|. The magnificent building was forty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and twenty-five cubits high, and it had a porch in the front as well as an inner chamber where the Ark of Zion, Holy of Holies, could dwell. Two Cherubim, each with golden wings five cubits in length, covered the Ark. The floors of the temple were inlaid with gold, and the door leaves were made of pine. Golden curtains were hung to enclose the Ark’s chamber. In the Sanctuary Solomon erected two columns, one of which was called Yaqum |sp|, the other Bäläz |sp|. Solomon also had a large font constructed, held up by twelve ornamented oxen organized into groups of three, with each group facing one of the cardinal directions. The font stood on the right side of the temple. On the left side there stood ten bronze pedestals with figures of lions, oxen, and Cherubim between. Accompanying each pedestal was a bronze basin, called a keṭrogawlos |sp|."
496-B,"King Solomon built the great Temple according to divine instruction, and each element in the Temple should be understood as symbolic. The reflections presented here outline the proper interpretation for many of the key architectural and decorative elements of the Temple. For example, the two Cherubim on the Mercy Seat represent the twofold virginity of Our Lady Mary, and the palm trees, which serve as a bed for the Lamb, stand for the Cross. Following a list of symbolic equivalences, the narrator asserts that the ritual of the Temple of Solomon serves as the basis for the ritual of the Holy Church, in which the original ritual is being perfected."
497,"King Hiram inherited his father’s skill as a bronze smith, and he used his craft to assist Solomon in constructing the Temple of Zion. The construction of the Temple took twenty years, at the end of which period Solomon gathered the elders of Israel in order to bring the Ark from Jerusalem. The priests transported the Ark, along with the ritual vessels from the Tabernacle. The priests arrived to much celebration, after which they placed the Ark in the Sanctuary. King Solomon declared that with the completion of the Temple, the Lord’s will had been done. Then he and the Israelites consecrated the Temple with a great sacrifice of twenty-two thousand oxen and a thousand sheep. After seven days of celebration the people returned to their homes. The Lord then appeared to Solomon and said that He had sanctified the Temple of Zion."
498,"After King Solomon consecrated the Temple of Zion, God appeared to him in a dream. In the dream God promised to establish his kingdom forever so long as Solomon observed the law He had delivered through Moses. If Solomon or his people ever abandoned this law, God promised to destroy the Temple and move the Ark to Heaven. Solomon reigned as king for forty more years, and when he died he was buried in Jerusalem, the city of his father, David."
499-A,"More than four centuries after the Temple of Zion’s construction, Nebuchadnezzar became the king of Babylon. At this time, the people began to violate the law of the Lord. They ignored the words of the prophets and started worshipping foreign gods. Furious at their abandonment of his law, the Lord caused the Chaldeans to destroy their own country. The prophets Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, and Ezra were all captured, and the great Temple fell. But the Ark, along with the Tablet of the Law contained therein, remained hidden."
499-B,"Thirty years after the destruction of Babylon, Ezra went to the wilderness to fast and pray for seven days. A vision came to him of a weeping woman in torn clothing. Ezra asked what made her weep, and she explained how she and her husband had struggled to have a child. She had prayed to God for help, and after thirty years of marriage the Lord gave them a son. Their son grew up and got married, but upon entering the bridal chamber he immediately died. The woman had come to the desert to mourn. Ezra responded that he and others were mourning the destruction of the Temple of Zion. When she heard these words, a light shone from the woman’s face, and she ceased to be a woman. In her stead Ezra saw a city with a wide foundation. He cried out in fear, whereupon the angel Uriel came and explained that Ezra’s vision had come from God. The angel said the woman he had met represented Zion, and that her thirty years of barrenness represented the three thousand years that passed before Solomon built the Temple. The woman’s son represented Solomon, and her son’s death represented the fall of Jerusalem. Finally, the light in the woman’s face represented the beauty and dignity of Zion. Ezra rejoiced at the angel’s interpretation of his vision."
500,"The narrator describes the various precious stones used in the construction of the Temple of Zion. For instance, the foundation was formed with sapphire and ruby (kärkäden |sp|), and the courts were made with beryl. The narrator also recounts how the angels and archangels glorified the Temple. He then calls for the people gather and offer their praise in devotion to Our Lady Mary."
501,"A vision concerning the Ark of Zion came to the prophet Zechariah |sp| during the second year of King Darius’s reign. In the eighth month of that year an angel roused him from sleep and showed him a lamp stand containing seven lamps with seven covers. He also saw Our Lady Mary in the image of the Holy Zion, which is the Ark of the Law of the Covenant."
