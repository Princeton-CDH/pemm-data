Fol. 9a, 1; Orient. 652, Fol. 2b.] NOW there was a certain Bishop in the church of Teltelya whose name was Dexius, and he was a righteous man and a fearer of God, and he loved our Lady Mary exceedingly. His mouth declared her praise, and his heart was filled with thoughts of her, and he ministered unto her with exceedingly great diligence and care; and he wrote the Book of her Miracles and History, and he ceased not to meditate upon the same at eventide and at morn. And it came to pass that when he came nigh to finishing the writing of her praises, our Lady the Virgin Mary, the Majesty of Christian people, brought unto him glad tidings openly, and she said unto him, "" Give me the Book of my History and Miracles, which my beloved son hath made, into my hands."" And she took the Book of her Miracles, and she opened it and read therein; and she was exceedingly pleased therewith. And she said unto him, "" Behold, O my beloved, thou hast toiled for me. Behold now, I am well pleased with thee and I give thanks unto thee, and the blessing of my beloved Son shall be upon thee and shall dwell in thy house, and He shall bless thy children and those that shall be descended from thee with the blessing of heaven, because thou hast written this Book for me ""; and having said these words she disappeared from him. And the Bishop rejoiced with an exceeding great joy because Mary had brought him glad tidings, and had shown herself unto him openly, and had spoken unto him mouth to mouth; Miracles of the Virgin Mary and he loved her the more and his heart was smitten with deep love for her. Then he meditated in his heart and said, ""Behold, I will exalt her honour and majesty, and I will add thereunto very much more than I have been wont to do aforetime."" And he made a great festival, the like of which man had never made, in commemoration of Mary, not on the day of her glorious nativity, but before it, and he chose one day of all the days, and established the celebration of all the festival upon it, and he made regulations concerning it and confirmed it. And all the people of the city celebrate the festival unto this day according to the ordinance of the Bishop, and they keep the feast of the commemoration of Mary with joy and gladness.

Fol. 18a, 1.] NOW there was in this holy monastery, which was renowned in the days of the Abbuna Abba Gabriel, Archbishop of Alexandria, a certain holy monk who had lived there from his youth, and his name was Isaac, and he loved our Lady with all his might. And he prepared for himself certain work to do without any man knowing about it, and he was the guardian of the church, and the key thereof was in his hand. And after the prayer which was to be said before sleep was ended, and when the monks had gone into their cells to sleep, Isaac used to go to the church, and having opened the door he would go inside it, and stand up before the picture of our Lady, the holy Virgin Mary, which was on the western wall, the whole night long. And he would begin to say the prayer of the Gospel, and he would make three hundred prostrations before her, and say at each prostration, "" O my Lord Jesus Christ, make me to see Thy Mother "" ; and he continued to do this for seven years, and no man knew anything about these prostrations. And it came to pass, at the end of the seven years, on a certain night of the festival of our Lady the Virgin, that is to say, the twenty-first day of the month of Takhshash (December 17), when Isaac was prostrating himself before the picture (or, image) of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, that she came forth from her picture (or, image) and she shone with an ex ceedingly great splendour which was seven times brighter than lightning. And she said unto him, ""Why hast thou wearied thyself [in entreating] my beloved Son to show thee her who gave Him birth? Behold, I am the Mother of Life, the woman who gave birth to Jesus Christ; command me, and I will come to thee, and whatsoever thou desirest that will I do for thee."" And he said unto her, "" O my Lady, I beseech thee to make supplication on my behalf to thy beloved Son."" And she said unto him, "" Behold, God Almighty hath received thy petition, and He hath commanded me to come unto thee, and to fulfil thy desire; and three days hence thou shalt be where I am."" And it came to pass that, when he heard her words and saw her beauty and saw that she was crowned with light, he fell down upon the ground and became like unto a dead man. Then did she take hold of him with her hand and lift him up. And she disappeared from him into the picture that was before him. Then straightway Isaac went into his cell, and the sickness of fever fell upon him, and in the morning he called for the bishop of the city, whose name was Abraham, who chanced to be dwelling in the monas tery that day, and when he came Isaac made known unto him all that he had seen. And Isaac said unto him, "" O my father, release me from all the bonds of [my] sin, for I dared to beseech God to show me her who gave Him birth, a thing for which I was unfit."" And he released him, and said unto him, "" O my son, if thou goest to God make thou mention of me, so that I may find mercy on the day of the Great Judgement."" And at the end of the third day Isaac died, and he inherited life everlasting, even as our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, had promised him. Isaac the monk, having wished and desired greatly, Saw thy beautiful face on a certain day. As thou didst speak unto him until he rejoiced ex ceedingly. So, 0 my Lady, say thou unto me, "" Rejoice, O my servant, After three days thou shalt be with me."" Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933. One Hundred and Ten Miracles of Our Lady Mary, pp. 20-22.

Fol. 15a, 1; B. Fol. 19b, 1.] THERE was a certain God-fearing man who loved our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, and his country was Dafra. And he was married to a woman by whom he had three children, two boys and a girl. Now the girl was young and she was called "" Mary."" And the mother of the children died and they mourned for her. And it came to pass on a day, which was the festival of the glorious Nativity, that the two boys wished to go to the church, and they left the little girl [in the house], and they fastened the door upon her so that she might not go out, for it was night. But she wept and cried out, saying, "" Take me with you, and let me participate with you in the offering up of the Offering "" ; but they refused [to take] her, and they went on their way. Then the little girl went to the picture of our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, and she cried out with tears, saying, "" O my Lady, have compassion upon me and give me consolation."" And straightway our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, who maketh to rejoice and giveth consolation unto those who make supplication unto her, appeared unto the girl, and said unto her, "" What aileth thee, O my daughter? "" And our holy Lady Mary embraced the child, who said unto her, "" They would not let me go to the church to partake of the Offering on the day of the holy festival whereon our Redeemer was born."" And our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, said unto her, "" Be not sad, but come ""; and she carried the child to the church, and she partook of the Offering with the folk who were enlightened. Then our Lady Mary said unto her, "" Three days hence I will take thee, and thou shalt be with me "" ; and three days later the child departed this life, and the Virgin Mary made her like unto herself. And a certain good, and righteous, and God-fearing man saw the child arrayed in purple and following our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, the Mother of Life, Who redeemed us, and he mar velled greatly, and he told the people concerning her. And all those who heard this praised the glorious and Most High God, and gave thanks unto our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary. O Mary, who didst make to follow thee and didst take away in secret A certain maiden, and didst array her in purple ; Thy sandals are bound on [thy feet], and the staff with thee is life. Wheresoever thou goest, O my Lady, make thou me, even me to follow. Blessed is the man who followeth the Lady [Mary].Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933.

Fol. 17a, 1 j B. Fol. 21a, 1.] NOW there was in days of old a certain man who was a painter, and there was no one who could be compared with him for skill in painting; and he loved our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, with his whole heart. And whensoever he painted a picture of her he did so with exceedingly great care, and he employed his greatest skill in the performance of the work. And it came to pass that he painted a likeness of our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary the God-bearer, on a stone wall in a certain church in the country of France; and the picture was a most wonderful and marvellous piece of work, and every one who saw it was astonished at the beauty of her form, and was led to believe that she was speaking unto him. And he painted by the side of the likeness of our holy Lady, the twofold Virgin, Mary, another picture in which he showed how [the blessed] dwelt in Paradise. And he painted yet another picture of hell representing the Devil who had been cast therein, and his wicked fiends. And Satan saw him, and was filled with rage against him, and he overturned and threw down the scaffolding on which the painter was working, and hurled both the painter and the scaf folding to the ground; now the French church was a very lofty one, and the painter cried out, "" O my Lady Mary, help me and save me from destruction."" And straightway a band of light came forth from the picture of the Virgin, and she stretched forth her arm and laid hold of the man, and he was caught in mid-air by her hand from out of the picture, and he remained sus pended at a height of ten cubits from the ground ; and he remained suspended by the hand out of the picture for the space of one hour, and he was uttering cries for help. And when the people heard his outcries they came to him and saw what a wonderful thing had been wrought by our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary: then, little by little, she let the painter come down, and she handed him over to the men that they might pass him down to the ground from one to the other. And the people who saw this wonderful thing gave glory unto God Almighty, and praised our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, the God-bearer, and they said, "" Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb "" ; and they celebrated a great festival for seven days. And they called that picture, "" The picture that delivered him and raised him up out of the dust "" ; and the hand of the Virgin hath re mained stretched out from the picture, just as it was when it laid hold on the painter, even unto this day, so that it may be a memorial of the event unto him that shall come after. The painter and his wooden scaffolding were hurled to the ground: As thou didst help him of old and didst straightway deliver him When he made entreaty, and [didst give him] glad ness in the place of weeping, Deliver thou me, O my Lady, O thou who art ornamented with splendour, And let the Proud One (i.e. the Devil) yearn in vain for my destruction.

Fol. 22b, 1.] NOW there was a picture of our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, in the Monastery of the Nagadyan; and it was in the room wherein the sick lay, and it faced the East, and every morning those who were sick therein committed themselves to its protection and care. And it came to pass that there was in that room a certain man who had lain there sick for many days, and each day he used to speak unto our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, saying, "" O my Lady, thou wilt never be able to raise me up unless I can come to the city of Jerusalem and worship at the place where on the foot of our Lord stood."" And whilst he was making entreaty in this wise our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, appeared unto him by night, and said unto him, "" Be not sad, but come so that I may trans port thee to the place where thou hast longed and de sired to be."" And straightway she carried him to Jerusalem where our Lord was buried, and to Bethlehem where He was born, and to the Jordan wherein He was baptized; and straightway she dipped the sick man in the water, and she made him go to the Mount of Olives, and to Mount Zion where our Lord abode with His disciples. And she said unto him, "" Rejoice and be glad, for I have fulfilled for thee everything which thou hast asked of me, and after the Festival of the Nativity I will take thee unto myself."" And at that moment the sick man rejoiced greatly, and he died in peace, even as our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, promised him. May her prayer and her blessing, and the mercy of her beloved Son, be with our King David for ever and ever! Amen. A vine-cluster is Mary, the taste of the fruit of which is sweet, And tender is the beauty of her flower. To the place where thy Son was buried in Jerusalem, As thou didst transport the sick pilgrim who made entreaty Unto thee in firm faith to bear him thither, even so bring me thither this day! This is another story belonging to the large class of miracles in which the Virgin appeared to sick monks on their death-beds. In order to relieve their minds of fears as to their future state she promised to take them to herself, i.e. to her own heaven, presumably without their being obliged to submit to judgement at the hands of God or her Son. It is probable that the journey which the dying monk took with the Virgin to visit the Holy Places was nothing more than a vision, in which his lifelong desire was fulfilled. There are many hints in monastic literature that monks in Egypt and other countries outside Palestine considered a visit to Jerusalem and Sinai and Horeb necessary for the salvation of their souls, and some of them certainly thought that without it they could not attain to the perfection of spiritual excellence. Jerusalem and Sinai were to them what Makkah and Madinah are to the Muslims. Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933. One Hundred and Ten Miracles of Our Lady Mary, pp. 33-34.

Fol. 13b, 1.] NOW there was a certain Hebrew in the city of Akhmim1 who loved our holy Lady, the Godbearer, from the depth of his heart, and the mention of her name, with fear and trembling, was never absent from his tongue ; and when he bowed down before her he was wont to embrace the ground in honour of her name. And the man was a priest, and he ministered holily in the church at the time of [burning] incense and presenting the offering (i.e. Eucharist). And it came to pass that when the days of his youth had passed, his strength failed and he was unable to stand up. And when the Archbishop knew that he had become feeble and was not able to stand up, he appointed two deacons to minister with him and to give him assistance. Now one day whilst he was singing praises to the name of our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, the God-bearer, and was bowing down to her to the ground, he fell for ward upon his breast, and his backbone was broken. And he cried out with a loud voice, and said, "" O my Lady Mary, come thou and help me in my fall."" Then straightway our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, appeared unto him standing on the right side of the altar, and she stretched out her hand over him, and touched his backbone which was broken, and made it whole. And she made a sign to him to come and stand on the right- hand side of the altar where she was. And immediately he perceived this he rejoiced greatly, and he marvelled and was astonished at the beauty of her form, and at the splendour which was round about her; and his old age was renewed, and he became a vigorous young man [again]. And he continued to minister in the church unto our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, all his days; and she added unto the years of his life one hundred and thirty years; and all his days were two hundred and thirty years, and then he died in peace and departed unto everlasting life. The blessed Hebrew in the land of Akhmim who had grown old, Whilst praising thy name and bowing to thee fell down. As thou didst appear unto him of old, and didst speak unto him the thing that was right, Even so, O Mary, appear thou unto me when I have taken to my bed; For upon this thing is my mind set with great anxiety.

Fol. 15a, 1.] NOW there was a certain monk called Damianus who dwelt in the city of Philippi, and he loved our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, from the depth of his heart, and he served her with all his power and strength, and he kept vigil in her church by day and by night. And that monk was a scribe, and it came to pass that, as he was copying the manuscripts [of her His tory], every time he had to make mention [of the name] of the Lady Mary he magnified her and paid honour unto her. Now he did not write her name with common water of lampblack (i.e. black ink), but he wrote it with ink made of gold and silver, and with rose-coloured paint, and with divers splendid colours that were like unto them in beauty and in value. And when that scribe fell ill, and was nigh unto death, before his soul departed from his body our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, appeared unto him, and said unto him : "" O my faithful servant, art not thou he who instead of writing my name in common black ink hath done so with ink of gold and silver, and hath painted it with divers splendid colours that are like unto them in beauty and value, and hath decorated it and made it glorious with the best of thine ability? Come now with me, that thou mayest see thy name inscribed with ornamental letters upon a pillar of gold in the kingdom of heaven. Fear not death to this transitory world, for behold, I will give thee everlasting life, and the joy that never cometh to an end."" And it came to pass that when she had spoken these words unto him his soul went forth from his body without pain and without suffering; and this miracle became known in all the country. May her prayer and the mercy of her beloved Son be with our King David for ever and ever! Amen. For Damianus who served thee as on a high moun tain with deep devotion Thou didst write his name upon the pillar of red gold. O shining East, O Mary, O thou Morning, Write thou my name upon thy holy garments And upon the apparel of thy Son which is sprinkled with blood.     Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933.

Fol. 16b, i.] NOW there was a certain Bishop of Rome who was called Abbas. He was a good and holy man, and he feared God Almighty and kept himself from unchastity and from meditation upon evil. And it came to pass that, one day during the festival [of the Virgin], when he was saying the prayer of consecration so that he might administer the Holy Mysteries to the people —now the people, both men and women, were in the habit at the time when they were about to receive the Holy Mysteries, before they prostrated themselves, of embracing the hands and the feet of the priest who was going to minister unto them—he smelt the odour of a certain woman as she was embracing his hands, and the unclean desire of the flesh entered into his heart, and he burned with the flame of lust. And after he had ended the Offering, he departed and went quickly into the chamber where the treasures belonging to the church were kept, and he took a knife and cut off his hand, and he began to weep. And it came to pass that while he tarried there the people in the sanctuary be came very sad, and the priests and deacons went to him and said unto him : "" O master and governor of the people, we have waited long [for thee], and we are greatly distressed at thy tarrying""; and when they spake these words to him he wept the more. Then he rose up and went with them, and when he came before the picture of the holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, he fell *4 Abbas y Bishop of Rome down on his face before it, and he worshipped her and made supplication unto her, and entreated her to have mercy upon him, and to help him, and to pardon his sin. Then straightway our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, appeared unto him, and she took his hand [which he had cut off] in her holy hands, and rejoined it to the place from which it had been cut off, and it became whole even as it was aforetime, and no mark whatsoever of the cut could be found; then she disappeared from him. And when the priests and deacons saw this they marvelled and were silent. And they related this miracle to the people, and ascribed praise unto the glorious and Most High God, and gave thanks unto our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, who is able to perform all things, and who worketh miracles and doeth wonders. Now Abbas, a priest of Rome, Took a knife and cut off his hand, which caused him pain. As thou, O Mary, the sister of Salome, didst heal him of old, Even so do thou now heal the wound in my soul, and grant me rest Whensoever I invoke thy name, which giveth protec tion.Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933. One Hundred and Ten Miracles of Our Lady Mary, pp. 14-16. London: Oxford University Press, H. Milford.   Va THE VIRGIN MARY AND LEO, BISHOP OF ROME [Brit. Mus. MS. Orient. No. 652, Fol. 82g.] THERE was a certain young man in the city of Rome who was a Muslim, and he was a survivor from the days of Islam [in that city]. And he used to go into a church, and stand before a picture of our Lady Mary, and salute her with salutations. And one day she spake unto him from out of her picture, and she said unto him, "" Why dost thou act thus, and come every day and pay me homage, not being one of the men of the Christian Faith ? "" And he said unto her, "" I know that thou art the mother of God, and that thou canst deliver me from Sheol."" And she said unto him, "" Go thou to Father Leo, and he will help thee, and thou shalt be glad""; and he went to Father Leo. And Father Leo went out and he found the young man, and he said unto him, "" What dost thou want? "" And the young man said unto him, "" I wish thee to bring me back to the Christian Faith."" And Abba Leo baptized him, and called him by his own name, and he took him with him, and treated him as one of his chil dren. And he handed him over to a teacher, and made him a deacon, and afterwards he made him a priest. When Abba Leo died, the people elected him to be their Abba in the room of Leo, for he was good and holy. And after he had been appointed Abba, one day he put on the Eucharistic vestments, and celebrated the Eucharist, and the congregation came and em braced his hands and his feet. And a few days later, a c 17 Miracles of the Virgin Mary friend, a young woman, wished to go to him so that he might do her good, and she came to him with the [other] people, and she embraced his hand, and kissed it, and he was exceedingly angry. And having finished the celebration of the Eucharist, he went up on his couch and said, "" This hand of mine is defiled."" And he took a knife and cut it off, and he wrapped it in a cloth and set it down under his bed and went to sleep. And when the morning came, the people came to him and said, "" Come forth and officiate, for it is customary for a new Abba after his appointment to officiate for eight days without cessation "" ; and he said unto them, "" I cannot officiate to-day."" And they went away from him in anger saying each to the other, "" He is a pagan (fAramawi) and doth not wish to be Abba or to offici ate."" And they went to him again on the third day, and said unto him, "" Officiate."" And he said unto them, "" I cannot."" And they said unto him, "" If thou wilt not officiate to-morrow they will set thee aside, and appoint another Abba in thy stead."" And he said unto them, "" Let them do as they please; I am well pleased that they should do this."" And at eventide he went down to the church, and stood up in front of the picture which had spoken unto him, and he said unto it, "" O my compassionate Lady, who didst show thy mercy and compassion unto me being unworthy of this gift, thou knowest how I have cut off my hand."" And the picture said unto him, Thou art a man without understand ing and hast cut off thy hand. Knowest thou not that repentance cleanseth from sin? From to-day thou must never do such a thing again. Take this new hand which God hath given thee. And she fastened upon him a hand which was bright like the sun, and which sent forth light into all the place, and he rejoiced and was glad. And he gave thanks unto our Lady Mary who had shown favour unto him from first to last, and he went up into his bed and slept until daybreak. And 18 Leoy Bishop of Rome at daybreak he went down to the church, and arrayed himself in the Eucharistic vestments, and when he raised his hand, there shot forth from it a light like that of the sun. And all those who looked at it were fright ened, and all those who were in the church marvelled at this thing. And when he had finished the Office he went up upon his couch. And the bishops said unto him, "" Tell us what is this thing which we saw from thy hand to-day."" And he said unto them, "" Verily I tell you that my Lady Mary, the merciful one, gave me this hand. It is not a hand made of the earth "" ; and then he took up the hand which he had cut off [from under his bed] and showed it to them. And they marvelled at this thing and glorified God and gave thanks to our Lady Mary, who showeth acts of grace to those who serve her, and helpeth them in the time of their tribulation.Budge, E. A.

Fol. 12b, 1.] NOW there was a certain artificer who loved our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-bearer, with all his heart, and he was wont to address Saluta tions unto her day by day regularly, both morning and evening, and he continued to do this for many days. And it came to pass one day that he said unto her, "" O my gracious Lady, I address Salutations unto thee continually, but thou dost never return my salutation unto me."" And after he had said these words unto her he began to read the [Forty- two] Salutations to our Lady Mary, standing before her picture (or, image). And when he came to the passage wherein he said, "" Blessed art thou among women,"" our Lady Mary, the God-bearer, answered him from out of her picture, and said unto him, ""And blessed art thou among men."" And these words she spake unto him thrice. And when the artificer heard these words from the picture of our Lady Mary, he bowed down before her, and repented himself that he had dared to speak unto her; but he rejoiced because of the words which she had spoken unto him. And he loved her much more than before, and he devoted himself with additional zeal to her service until he passed away from this fleeting world. Inasmuch as the angel of glad tidings gave thee an everlasting salutation, The artificer was dear unto thee; 6 The Virgin Mary and the Artificer Since thou, 0 Mary, wast blessed by the Book of Hawi,1 Bless me, O my Lady, and may thy Son, the Nazarene, [bless me] With the blessings of Judah and Levi.

Then she said unto Hanna, “Blessed art thou, O Hanna, for among [all] the creatures of the world there is none like unto thee, who can with her body heal the eyes of the blind”; and her kinsfolk worshipped her, and she was glorious unto them, even like the sun, which is more glorious than the morning star. And the fame of her was heard throughout all the ends of the world, and they brought unto her all those who were sick and diseased [fol. 77 5 ], and they touched  her body and were healed. Then they all said, “If the Child can heal “[the sick] whilst He is in the womb, what will He [not be able to do] when He hath been born?” And when the children of Israel heard [this], they gathered themselves together, and said, “What shall we say “concerning this matter?

And she dwelt [in her  house] and added unto her prayers and supplications, and she gave her  possessions unto the poor and needy with joy and gladness, saying, “How can I reward God for all which He hath done unto me?” And she refrained from eating every kind of unclean food, and she made supplications to God and bowings [before Him] in great abundance, and prayed that He would preserve that which He had given unto her. And it came  to pass when the days of her conception were ended, on the first day of Genbot she brought forth a daughter, who was brighter than the sun, the beauty of whose [fol. 71 a] face was sweeter than honey and sugai, and the smell of whose odour was more lovely than that of any flower. Now when her kinsfolk and neighbours heard [thereof] they rejoiced  with a great joy, and they gathered themselves together and came unto her, and when they saw her daughter they marvelled exceedingly, and held their peace. Then they held converse among themselves, and said,  “We have never seen a child like unto this, for the grace of God in its  “fullest measure is upon her, and the light of God filleth all her members, and they continued seven days with Joachim and Hanna his wife, and they rejoiced and proclaimed the mighty deeds of God, that is to say  the grace of God.
