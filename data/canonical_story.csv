Fol. 28b, 1.] NOW there was in the great and holy Monastery of Abba Samuel of Kalman a beautiful church which had been built in the name of our pure and holy Lady Mary, and in this holy church, in the west wall thereof, was a large and wonderful picture of her. And in this famous monastery there lived a certain holy man who had fixed in his heart and mind the salutation of the Angel Gabriel unto our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, and it never ceased to be in his mouth and on his tongue. And he rested neither by night nor by day from reciting salutations to our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, and he placed his confidence in her, [and believed] that she would save him in the presence of her beloved Son. He [pretended] neither to fast nor to pray, and he made himself to appear to be foolish and weak of understanding, so that the [other] monks might not know concerning his strivings and labours; and he used to act in such a way that the monks treated him with contempt—now this was an unseemly thing for the monks to do—when they went out from the church. In the morning, at the time when the sun was rising, he ate a few herbs and beans, and to every one who spake with this monk he appeared to be mad. And he ate nothing from that time until the same hour of the morrow of that day, when he again ate in the presence of the monks; and this he was wont to do daily. Now when the monks saw him acting in this wise the matter was hard for them, and they were exceedingly sorry for him. And this monk, whom we have already mentioned, did not receive the Holy Mysteries except on three days in each year, that is to say, on the festival of the blessed Nativity, on the festival of the holy Epiphany, and on the festival of the precious Passover (Easter). And our honourable and holy Fathers, the doctors of the Church, have commanded that the Offering shall be offered up on these days of festivals of the Son at the sound of cockcrow in the night. And it came to pass that when the monks saw him eating each day in the morning before the prayer of the third hour of the day, and knew nothing about his fasting, and of how he was wont to fast until the morrow of the day when at the time of the same hour he ate [again], they imagined that he ate at the ordinary times throughout the day, and did not keep the ordinance of the monks; and they murmured greatly against him among themselves. And when the day of the festival of the Nativity of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, which is on the first day of the month Genbot (April 26), had come—now the day of the nativity of the woman who saved the whole world [fell that year] upon the day of the blessed First Day of the week—the monks were gathered together in the church to be present at the honourable consecration of the Offering for the celebration of the festival. And there was with them the holy father who was called Abba Isaac, and he was the Abbot of the monastery and the father confessor and prior, and he saw the monk whom we have already mentioned with a few lupin seeds, which had been soaked in water, in his hand, and he wished to eat them. Then the Abbot said unto the monks, ""Seize ye that monk and take from him those lupin seeds that he hath in his hand, and let two of the brethren bring him into the church and keep guard over him until the service of consecration be ended—sup posing it be possible for us to offer up the Holy Offering. Peradventure this evil habit shall be removed from him by the prayer of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, and he shall walk in the way of the monks with the keeping of fasts and prayer."" Then the monks did according as the Abbot had commanded them, and they took the lupin seeds from his hand with rude violence; and straightway the monk was enraged with those who had laid hands upon him, and he became like a madman. And when they had brought him to the church he said unto the monks who were going to keep guard over him, ""O my brethren, will ye not hearken unto the voice of your father concerning me? I am a poor and wretched man, take me unto the picture of our Lady so that I may entreat her to accept the prayer of our Abbot, and that all my hunger may be removed from me little by little."" And they told him that they agreed to do so, and they went with him to the eikon of the Virgin, and he prostrated himself in adoration before her, and said, ""O thou who dost save the penitent, O thou who art the hope of the poor and needy, O thou who art the helper of the oppressed, deliver thou me from these monks, for I can not fast until the time of the Offering."" And it came to pass that when the two brethren heard these words from him they laughed within themselves, and they heaped derision upon him. Now when our compassionate Lady knew that the whole body of monks were murmuring against him, and that they were laughing at him and treating him with contempt, she put into his heart the good thought that she would make manifest unto the other monks her mighty and marvellous acts and the faith of the monk and the confidence which he had placed in her. And at the moment when the service of consecration was half finished, and when every man had brought his mind into a fit state and collected his thoughts to hear the holy words of the consecration, the monk drew nigh unto the west wall of the church, wherein was placed the picture of the Virgin Mary, and standing up before it and lifting up his eyes he said unto her, ""O my Lady, peradventure thou dost receive my prayer, and dost accept my supplication and the salutation of the Angel Gabriel wherewith I have saluted thee ceaselessly by day and by night. I am a poor and wretched man and a sinner, and only God and man have any knowledge of me. I have thought that thou wouldst deliver me on the Day of Judgement before thy Son, and if thou wilt deliver me before thy Son, then deliver me from these monks; for [all men] know that whosoever putteth his trust in thee shall neither perish nor be put to shame before thy beloved Son."" Then he girded himself about with faith and power, and he took off his skull cap from his head, and smote the western wall of the church therewith, and said, ""O might of the Virgin Mary, deliver me."" And it came to pass that, when he had spoken in this wise, at that same moment the wall was rent asunder, and having hurled his skull-cap from his hand into the middle of the church he passed outside quickly through the opening in the wall. And when he had gone out the wall closed together again, with the exception of a small opening that was large enough for a man to put his hand into, and this remained as a memorial and a testimony of the miracle which the holy Virgin Mary had wrought; and when the monks saw what had taken place they were astonished with a great astonishment. Then the monks went out to look for the monk in all the desert places round about, and in the caves and hollows in the ground, but they found no trace of him. And straightway they sorrowed with a great sorrow, and their hearts were pained, and their Abbot was exceedingly harsh [towards them] because of the things that they had been wont to do unto him. For, when in times past they had been in the habit of seeing him every day at dawn, some of them cursed him, and some buffeted him, and some spat in his face, and others laughed at him and derided him. Now when they had seen this miracle they recognized the righteousness and the strivings of the monk, and how he had loved our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, in his heart, and how he had put his confidence in her, even as they had heard from him when he departed through the opening in the wall. And they learned that of a certainty the heart felt prayer of a pure and sincere mind is better and more honourable than the prayer of the tongue, even as our Lord saith in the Holy Gospel, ""When thou risest up to pray, enter into thy chamber, and shut thy door, and pray unto thy Father in secret"" (Matt. vi. 6). Now the meaning of this [verse] is, ""Collect thy mind within thyself""; and in that it saith, ""Shut thy door,"" thou must shut thy mouth and pray with thy heart. For the prayer of the heart in a mind that is sincere and collected is better than the prayer of the tongue when the mind is wandering about and going into another place. It is meet for a man to pray with his heart, and not with his tongue [only], even as this monk was wont to do at all times, although no one knew about it. And it came to pass that, when the monks saw what had happened, they went to the Bishop, and told him all these things. Now when the Father, the Bishop, had heard thereof, he sent and informed the Archbishop concerning what he had heard and seen in the matter of the skull-cap, which the monk had thrown into the church, and concerning the miracle that had taken place through it. And when the Archbishop had heard these things he rejoiced greatly, and he sent to the holy Monastery of Abba Samuel asking for the skull-cap of the monk, so that he might obtain a blessing therefrom; but the monks would not send it to him, for they thought that he would lay it up in his own house as a thing to be kept there for safety. So they placed the skull-cap in the store-chest of the church as a memorial of the miracle that the Lady of us all, the Virgin Mary, had wrought. Now in order that the Bishop might prepare the way for him, the Archbishop sent a message to l1im telling him to go to the Monastery of Kalman, and to bring back the skull-cap to him that he might be blessed thereby. And the Bishop obeyed the command of the Archbishop, and went to the monastery, and took the skull-cap of the monk from out of the chest wherein the property of the church was stored, and he obtained a blessing therefrom. Then he went to the wall that had been rent asunder, and he obtained a blessing from the opening that was left, and he prostrated himself three times before the picture of our Lady Mary, and he received a blessing therefrom. Then the Bishop anointed himself with oil from the lamp that was kept burning before the picture, and he departed from the monastery. Now when he had journeyed a little way on his road, and had arrived in the desert, he searched for the skull cap and found it not; and having turned back straight way he came to the monastery a second time, and he found the skull-cap in the place wherein it had been laid formerly, and whence he had taken it. Then he took the skull-cap a second time, and laid it between the folds of his apparel, and he tied it securely to his person with strips of leather. And when he had journeyed a little way he untied the strips of leather, and un fastened his apparel, but he could not find the skull cap in it; then he turned back a third time to the monastery, where he again found the skull-cap. And he took it out of the store-chest again and fastened it to the inside of the case wherein he carried his cross, and having taken it in his hand he set out again on his journey, but when, having gone a little way on his road, he unfastened the case of the cross, he did not find the skull-cap. Now when he had gone back to the monastery a fourth time and found the skull-cap there, he knew that God did not wish it to leave the holy Monastery of Abba Samuel. And the report of this thing was heard in all the borders, and in all the countries and cities round about. Glory be to God Who chose Mary, the Virgin, to be the Mother of His Son Jesus Christ, and thanks be unto His Only Son Who put on flesh of her in becoming the new man, and adoration be unto the Holy Spirit Who purified her from all unchastity. O Mary, who without stroke of hammer, or blow of chisel, Didst cleave a wall of dry stone where there passed out into the desert The man who was called Shalura, with whom thou wast well pleased, Cleave thou the back of mine enemy and the belly of him that hateth me, And take thou a new sword [to do it].

Fol. 9a, 1; Orient. 652, Fol. 2b.] NOW there was a certain Bishop in the church of Teltelya whose name was Dexius, and he was a righteous man and a fearer of God, and he loved our Lady Mary exceedingly. His mouth declared her praise, and his heart was filled with thoughts of her, and he ministered unto her with exceedingly great diligence and care; and he wrote the Book of her Miracles and History, and he ceased not to meditate upon the same at eventide and at morn. And it came to pass that when he came nigh to finishing the writing of her praises, our Lady the Virgin Mary, the Majesty of Christian people, brought unto him glad tidings openly, and she said unto him, ""Give me the Book of my History and Miracles, which my beloved son hath made, into my hands."" And she took the Book of her Miracles, and she opened it and read therein; and she was exceedingly pleased therewith. And she said unto him, ""Behold, O my beloved, thou hast toiled for me. Behold now, I am well pleased with thee and I give thanks unto thee, and the blessing of my beloved Son shall be upon thee and shall dwell in thy house, and He shall bless thy children and those that shall be descended from thee with the blessing of heaven, because thou hast written this Book for me""; and having said these words she disappeared from him. And the Bishop rejoiced with an exceeding great joy because Mary had brought him glad tidings, and had shown herself unto him openly, and had spoken unto him mouth to mouth; Miracles of the Virgin Mary and he loved her the more and his heart was smitten with deep love for her. Then he meditated in his heart and said, ""Behold, I will exalt her honour and majesty, and I will add thereunto very much more than I have been wont to do aforetime."" And he made a great festival, the like of which man had never made, in commemoration of Mary, not on the day of her glorious nativity, but before it, and he chose one day of all the days, and established the celebration of all the festival upon it, and he made regulations concerning it and confirmed it. And all the people of the city celebrate the festival unto this day according to the ordinance of the Bishop, and they keep the feast of the commemoration of Mary with joy and gladness.

14,The composition of the Wǝddāse Maryam by the Syrian potter.,Africa Ethiopia probably,,LIT3622Miracle,"XXXV THE VIRGIN MARY AND THE POTTER [B. Fol. 69b.] HEARKEN, O ye my fathers and my brethren, that we may declare unto you the great miracle that took place through our holy Lady, Mary the two fold Virgin, the God-bearer, which the holy fathers have narrated unto me, and God is my witness that I add nothing thereunto, and that I take nothing there from. Now they told us, saying: In the country of Syria there dwelt a certain man who was a potter, and he feared God, and loved our holy Lady, Mary the twofold Virgin, the God-bearer, and he ascribed praise unto her from the depth of his heart. And our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, appeared unto that potter at dawn on the second day of the week, in great majesty, and she was arrayed in light and angels followed her. And she said unto him, ""Peace be unto thee, O my beloved one, thou man beloved of my Son, I have come unto thee that thou mayest multiply thy praises of me, and that they may become for me an everlasting memo rial."" Then he said unto her, ""O my Lady, I am a worm and no man, and a castaway; how can I bless thee adequately? Nevertheless, bless thou me with thy holy hand, O thou storehouse of blessing."" Then she said unto him, ""The blessing of my Son, and the blessing of His Father, and the blessing of the Holy Spirit, be with thee. Amen."" And when our holy Lady had thus spoken unto him the Holy Spirit came upon him in full measure, and he opened his mouth, and said, ""God willed to set Adam free from grief and sorrow of heart, and He restored him to the state wherein he had been of old""; and he recited the Praise of Mary for the second day of the week until the end thereof, and the Holy Spirit spake by his lips. And when he had finished praising her, our holy Lady, Mary the twofold Virgin, blessed him and saluted him, and gave him the words of peace, and she went up into heaven with great glory. Then again on the third day she came unto him, and she said unto him, ""Peace be unto thee, O my beloved, thou shalt sing my praises this day even as the Holy Spirit shall teach thee."" And he said unto her, ""Bless me""; and she blessed him. And he opened his mouth and said, ""O thou crown in which we exult, thou woman who hath the pre-eminence! our holy Lady, Mary the two fold Virgin, the God-bearer, is the foundation whereon we build""; and he recited the Praise of Mary for the third day unto the end thereof. And she rejoiced, and blessed him, and gave him the salutation of peace, and went up into heaven with great glory. Then again on the fourth day our holy Lady came unto him, and said unto him, ""Peace be unto thee, O thou man of God,"" and she blessed him, and said unto him, ""Sing thou my praises according to thy wont."" Then he opened his mouth, and said, ""All the hosts of heaven say: Blessed art thou, O thou second heaven who art upon earth, our holy Lady, Mary the twofold Virgin, the God-bearer, the second heaven""; and he sang the praise of Mary for the fourth day unto the end thereof. And similarly on the fifth day she came unto him, and he praised her, saying, ""The tree that Moses saw in a flame of fire in the wilderness, the branches whereof were not consumed, was a similitude of our holy Lady, Mary the twofold Virgin, the God-bearer."" And he sang the Praise of Mary for the fifth day unto the end thereof. Then on the Eve of the Sabbath our holy Lady, Mary the twofold Virgin, appeared unto him, and she sat upon a shining throne and she said unto him, ""Peace be unto thee, O my beloved, sing thou my praise with thy sweet songs."" And he said unto her, ""Blessed art thou above women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, O Virgin, the God-bearer."" And he sang the Praise of Mary for the sixth day unto the end thereof, and she blessed him and made him to rejoice, and she went up to heaven with great glory. And in like manner on the first day of the week, the Sabbath, our holy Lady came and said unto him, ""Joy be unto thee, O my beloved, and peace""; and rising up he prostrated himself before her. Then she said unto him, ""Sing thou my praises this day also, even as the Holy Spirit shall give thee understanding""; and he said unto her, ""Bless me""; and she blessed him. And he opened his mouth and said, ""The woman who is pure, and glorious, and holy in everything did clasp God in her hand, and all created things do rejoice with her, and cry out, and say, Rejoice, O thou that art full of grace, rejoice, for thou hast found favour; rejoice, for God is with thee."" And when he had made an end of praising her, she saluted him and went up into heaven with great glory. Now when the evening of the Sunday had come he drank wine and fell asleep. And when it was midnight our holy Lady appeared unto him, and said, ""Why didst thou not praise me to-day with praises more numerous than those of the other days? For the praises for this day should be more numerous than those of the other days."" And he said unto her, ""O my Lady, this day is the Sabbath of rest, and men do no work therein."" Then she said unto him, ""Rise up, and fear not, and stand in the place of thy [daily] labour, and what soever the Holy Spirit shall give thee understanding to say, that say."" Then rising up he received a blessing from her, and he kissed the cross that was in her hand. And he stood up in his workshop wherein he was wont to fashion his vessels of clay, and he opened his mouth and said, ""Thou hast been called 'Love,' O most blessed of women, and thou art a second moon who art called the holy of holies, wherein are the Tables of the Covenant."" Then he sang three portions of her praises, and he went on singing until the morning. And when the morning had come she blessed him and said unto him, ""Joy be with thee, O my beloved one. As thou hast caused me to rejoice by singing praises unto me upon earth, even so will I make thee to rejoice in the kingdom of heaven. As thou hast commemorated me by singing my praise upon earth, even so will I give unto thee in the kingdom of heaven as the reward of thy labour the joy that never endeth."" And this she did, according as she had led him to hope. And now, O my beloved brethren, see how great is the love that God and our holy Lady have towards the sons of men for the sake of a little praise; and see, too, that in return for a few good works our Lady will come down from heaven to him that loveth her and celebrateth her memorial. Praisings and glorifications are meet for thee In the mouths of angels and men who dwell everywhere, O Mary the Virgin, O Mary of the sweet-smelling mouth! Like the potter beloved by thee I offer unto thee salutation, And the commemoration of thy name which is more pleasant than spices and perfumes. Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933.

Fol. 51b, 1.] IT came to pass on a certain day that three Arabs set out to sail to the country of Rif (i.e. Upper Egypt) when the river [Nile] was very rough and troubled, and the waves thereof ran high, and they fell into tribulation. In order to fulfil their desire they set out to sail there, but the waves were too strong for them, and they were unable to make headway against them, and the billows were about to swallow them up. And the Arabs, in accordance with the custom of their fathers, prayed [for help] to their false Prophet, but they did not find deliverance. And when they had abandoned all hope of saving their lives, one of them who had visited the Monastery of Kalmon, and had seen the miracles that were wrought there, cried out, ""O Mary of the Monastery of Kalmon, who didst once make intercession for me, deliver thou me. If thou wilt deliver me from drowning in this sea, I will give to thy church a camel's load of dates for the food of the monks, and the camel also shall belong to the monastery, so that it may carry whatsoever the monks choose to lay upon it."" And his companion said, ""Yea, verily thou hast done well to mention this great name."" And when their companion heard this speech he laughed at them, and said, ""O dogs, why do ye forsake your faith and make entreaty for mercy to Mary?"" And at that very moment he was overwhelmed by the sea, and a crocodile swallowed him up, but in order that the man's companions might see him, and the miracle might be made manifest unto them, the creature brought him up again and held him in his mouth. Then the two Arabs made supplication unto our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, and they came to a mighty rock, and they climbed up on it and stood up on it in the midst of the raging waves. And a ship that was passing that way came to them, and they embarked therein, and came safely to the port to which it was sailing. Then straightway the Arab took a camel, which was the finest of his camels, and having laden it with dates he brought it to Solomon, the Abbot of the Monastery of Kalmon, and to all the monks, and he related unto them everything that had taken place. Now the Arab's companion possessed many sheep, and he sheared their wool and brought it to the monks, and said, ""Take this wool and make of it clothing for yourselves, for the sake of our Lady Mary who delivered me from drowning."" And when the monks heard his speech they gave praise unto the glorious and Most High God, and they glorified our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, who is gracious and full of mercy. Thy name, O Mary, was in days of old the strength Of the Arab men when they remembered it among the raging waters. Like the man who made a mock of them, Thine enemy, O my Lady at every time and season, Shall become the food of the crocodile and of the crusher of bones. Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933.

19,"The monk, Yǝsḥaq, who prayed for seven years that Saint Mary would appear to him.",,,LIT3592Miracle,"VI THE VIRGIN MARY AND ISAAC THE MONK [A. Fol. 13a, 1; B. Fol. 18a, 1.] NOW there was in this holy monastery, which was renowned in the days of the Abbuna Abba Gabriel, Archbishop of Alexandria, a certain holy monk who had lived there from his youth, and his name was Isaac, and he loved our Lady with all his might. And he prepared for himself certain work to do without any man knowing about it, and he was the guardian of the church, and the key thereof was in his hand. And after the prayer which was to be said before sleep was ended, and when the monks had gone into their cells to sleep, Isaac used to go to the church, and having opened the door he would go inside it, and stand up before the picture of our Lady, the holy Virgin Mary, which was on the western wall, the whole night long. And he would begin to say the prayer of the Gospel, and he would make three hundred prostrations before her, and say at each prostration, ""O my Lord Jesus Christ, make me to see Thy Mother""; and he continued to do this for seven years, and no man knew anything about these prostrations. And it came to pass, at the end of the seven years, on a certain night of the festival of our Lady the Virgin, that is to say, the twenty-first day of the month of Takhshash (December 17), when Isaac was prostrating himself before the picture (or, image) of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, that she came forth from her picture (or, image) and she shone with an exceedingly great splendour which was seven times brighter than lightning. And she said unto him, ""Why hast thou wearied thyself [in entreating] my beloved Son to show thee her who gave Him birth? Behold, I am the Mother of Life, the woman who gave birth to Jesus Christ; command me, and I will come to thee, and whatsoever thou desirest that will I do for thee."" And he said unto her, ""O my Lady, I beseech thee to make supplication on my behalf to thy beloved Son."" And she said unto him, ""Behold, God Almighty hath received thy petition, and He hath commanded me to come unto thee, and to fulfil thy desire; and three days hence thou shalt be where I am."" And it came to pass that, when he heard her words and saw her beauty and saw that she was crowned with light, he fell down upon the ground and became like unto a dead man. Then did she take hold of him with her hand and lift him up. And she disappeared from him into the picture that was before him. Then straightway Isaac went into his cell, and the sickness of fever fell upon him, and in the morning he called for the bishop of the city, whose name was Abraham, who chanced to be dwelling in the monastery that day, and when he came Isaac made known unto him all that he had seen. And Isaac said unto him, ""O my father, release me from all the bonds of [my] sin, for I dared to beseech God to show me her who gave Him birth, a thing for which I was unfit."" And he released him, and said unto him, ""O my son, if thou goest to God make thou mention of me, so that I may find mercy on the day of the Great Judgement.""

Fol. 15a, 1; B. Fol. 19b, 1.] THERE was a certain God-fearing man who loved our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, and his country was Dafra. And he was married to a woman by whom he had three children, two boys and a girl. Now the girl was young and she was called ""Mary."" And the mother of the children died and they mourned for her. And it came to pass on a day, which was the festival of the glorious Nativity, that the two boys wished to go to the church, and they left the little girl [in the house], and they fastened the door upon her so that she might not go out, for it was night. But she wept and cried out, saying, ""Take me with you, and let me participate with you in the offering up of the Offering""; but they refused [to take] her, and they went on their way. Then the little girl went to the picture of our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, and she cried out with tears, saying, ""O my Lady, have compassion upon me and give me consolation."" And straightway our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, who maketh to rejoice and giveth consolation unto those who make supplication unto her, appeared unto the girl, and said unto her, ""What aileth thee, O my daughter?"" And our holy Lady Mary embraced the child, who said unto her,"" They would not let me go to the church to partake of the Offering on the day of the holy festival whereon our Redeemer was born."" And our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, said unto her, ""Be not sad, but come""; and she carried the child to the church, and she partook of the Offering with the folk who were enlightened. Then our Lady Mary said unto her, ""Three days hence I will take thee, and thou shalt be with me""; and three days later the child departed this life, and the Virgin Mary made her like unto herself. And a certain good, and righteous, and God-fearing man saw the child arrayed in purple and following our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, the Mother of Life, Who redeemed us, and he marvelled greatly, and he told the people concerning her. And all those who heard this praised the glorious and Most High God, and gave thanks unto our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary. O Mary, who didst make to follow thee and didst take away in secret A certain maiden, and didst array her in purple; Thy sandals are bound on [thy feet], and the staff with thee is life. Wheresoever thou goest, O my Lady, make thou me, even me to follow. Blessed is the man who followeth the Lady [Mary]. Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933.

Fol. 143b, No. 130.] NOW there is in the country of Afrurgi, in a certain district, a high mountain in the belly of which there is much gold, and the men of the district used to come and dig therein, and they obtained much gold. And there was in the city a certain poor man who possessed nothing, and he was in very sore need of the things of this world. Now, as I have already said, the men of the city used to come to that mountain and dig out gold, and when they had returned to their houses, that poor man used to go to the mountain, and enter the mine, and collect the fragments, and find a little gold, which he would take to his house and with which he would buy food and raiment for himself. He had no other money, and by these means he subsisted. And he loved our Lady Mary, and he frequented her church, and bowed before her picture, and gave gifts to her continually. And he gave gifts daily to the church, one loaf of bread, one vessel of wine, one wax candle, and two dirhams of incense; these things he gave because of his love for our Lady Mary, saying, ""I come to thy house, the place where I would come, and I give offerings according to my ability."" And this he continued to do many days. And his wife was a beautiful woman and a fearer of God, and like her husband she believed in our Lady Mary with all her heart, and they were united in love and faith. And one day he went out, according to his wont, to the mountain wherefrom they dug out gold, and after the men of the city had de parted, he went into the mine to look for gold. And as he was in the mine the gallery wherein all the men of the city dug collapsed over him, and the entrance to it was buried in earth and stones. But by the Will of God two slabs of stone came and stood up, one on his right hand and the other on his left, like two pillars, and they supported the roof above that man. And he was as it were in a tent, and he suffered no injury whatsoever from all the earth and stones, for our Lady Mary protected him, and no harm reached him. And the men of the city came out and arrived at the shaft wherein the man was to carry off gold, according to their wont, and they found the entrance to the gallery blocked up with earth and stones, and they knew at once that the man was buried inside. And they wept exceedingly, and there was great lamentation in that city, and they said, ""Behold, the poor man is dead and is buried in the gallery of the mine."" And when his wife knew this she cried out and moaned from the depths of her heart, saying, ""Behold, my lord is dead and is buried in the earth of the mountains. Woe is me! Woe is me! Who will give me my lord's body to bury like the bodies of all other men?"" And then she petitioned our Lady Mary, saying, ""O thou boast of all the world, Queen of women, Mother of the Redeemer, behold, my lord is buried deep in the mine, and I have not got his body to bury in thy church. But I trust in thy prayer to preserve him by thy intercession. And behold, I will continue to give to thy church the offering that my lord used to bring there daily."" And that day she brought one loaf, one vessel of wine, one wax candle, and two dirhams of incense, and she continued to do this for twelve days, saying, ""It shall be for a memorial of my lord, so that he may find rest and peace with the souls of all the saints."" And after twelve days the men of the city went and came to the mine, and they said, ""Come, let us dig out this earth until we come to the body of him that is dead."" And as they were digging they heard a sound as of a man talking to a friend, and they said among themselves, ""Satans dwell in a place where there is gold in order to guard it; now they are lovers of money."" And in digging they came to the middle of the gallery, where they found the poor man who was entombed therein. And they said unto him, ""Art thou alive? Art thou not dead [being buried] so long? How hast thou continued to exist in the belly of the earth all the past twelve days?"" And the man answered and said unto them, ""When this gallery fell in these two pillars came and stood upright on my right hand and on my left, and supported the [roof of] this gallery above me; but I know not whence they came and who brought them here. And I have remained here until this present in safety, and comfort, and rest, and no harm of any kind hath befallen me; on the contrary, I seem to have been in a beautiful house."" And the people asked him and said unto him, ""How didst thou live, and what didst thou eat during this period?"" And the man answered and said unto them, ""The offering that I used to bring to the church, that is to say, one loaf of bread, one vessel of wine, one wax candle, and two dirhams of in cense, all these things, I say, did our Lady Mary bring unto me. And she said unto me, This loaf of bread shall serve as thy food, and this vessel of wine shall be for the joy of thy heart, and this wax candle shall burn before thee by day and by night so that the darkness may not overwhelm thee, and this incense shall serve thee for sweet perfume."" And when the people heard these words they marvelled greatly at them. Now whilst the man was buried in the mine his wife brought those gifts to the church and set them down at the gates thereof, and the gatekeeper used to bring them in whilst the priests were watching him, and when they went out the gifts had disappeared and could not be found. And then they called the gatekeeper and said unto him, ""Where are the offerings which the wife of the dead man hath brought? Where hast thou put them?"" And the gatekeeper answered and said unto them, ""I saw the woman bring them here, and when I turned round I could not find them."" And then the priests rebuked the gatekeeper and said unto him, ""Didst thou not make them disappear and carry them to thy house?"" And they thrust him out and drove him from the church. And when the man who was in the mine told the people that it was our Lady Mary who had brought to him the offerings they marvelled, and they glorified God and praised our Lady Mary, the worker of wonders and miracles. And the man whom she had saved from death forsook this world, and became a monk, and his wife became a nun, and they both continued to serve and worship our Lady Mary with a pure heart and a good mind; and they celebrated her festivals until they died and departed from this world; and they inherited the kingdom of heaven through the prayer of our Lady Mary, who is full of compassion and mercy, and is the mother of gladness.

Fol. 17a, 1 j B. Fol. 21a, 1.] NOW there was in days of old a certain man who was a painter, and there was no one who could be compared with him for skill in painting; and he loved our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, with his whole heart. And whensoever he painted a picture of her he did so with exceedingly great care, and he employed his greatest skill in the performance of the work. And it came to pass that he painted a likeness of our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary the God-bearer, on a stone wall in a certain church in the country of France; and the picture was a most wonderful and marvellous piece of work, and every one who saw it was astonished at the beauty of her form, and was led to believe that she was speaking unto him. And he painted by the side of the likeness of our holy Lady, the twofold Virgin, Mary, another picture in which he showed how [the blessed] dwelt in Paradise. And he painted yet another picture of hell representing the Devil who had been cast therein, and his wicked fiends. And Satan saw him, and was filled with rage against him, and he overturned and threw down the scaffolding on which the painter was working, and hurled both the painter and the scaf folding to the ground; now the French church was a very lofty one, and the painter cried out, ""O my Lady Mary, help me and save me from destruction."" And straightway a band of light came forth from the picture of the Virgin, and she stretched forth her arm and laid hold of the man, and he was caught in mid-air by her hand from out of the picture, and he remained sus pended at a height of ten cubits from the ground ; and he remained suspended by the hand out of the picture for the space of one hour, and he was uttering cries for help. And when the people heard his outcries they came to him and saw what a wonderful thing had been wrought by our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary: then, little by little, she let the painter come down, and she handed him over to the men that they might pass him down to the ground from one to the other. And the people who saw this wonderful thing gave glory unto God Almighty, and praised our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, the God-bearer, and they said, ""Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb""; and they celebrated a great festival for seven days. And they called that picture, ""The picture that delivered him and raised him up out of the dust""; and the hand of the Virgin hath remained stretched out from the picture, just as it was when it laid hold on the painter, even unto this day, so that it may be a memorial of the event unto him that shall come after. The painter and his wooden scaffolding were hurled to the ground: As thou didst help him of old and didst straightway deliver him When he made entreaty, and [didst give him] glad ness in the place of weeping, Deliver thou me, O my Lady, O thou who art ornamented with splendour, And let the Proud One (i.e. the Devil) yearn in vain for my destruction.

When the Angel of God appeared unto Joseph in the desert, saying, ""Arise, and take the Child and His Mother, and depart into the country of Egypt,"" Joseph rose up and took our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, and came unto the country of Egypt, and went to Mount Kueskuam and other places. And they took up their abode with the daughter of the sister of the mother of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary. And when they had dwelt in the country of Egypt for three years and seven months, Herod died, and the Angel of the Lord com manded Joseph to return to Jerusalem. And he came to the city of Maharraka, and thence to Matarye, and thence to the ""city of the bath.""

Fol. 55b, 1.] NOW there was a certain priest in the city of Cairo called John Bakansi, and he dwelt in a church that had been built in the name of the martyr Markoryos (Mercurius). And the days of this man were one hundred years, and both his eyes had become blind, and he remained the whole of the previous year seeing nothing at all. And when the light of his eyes failed he began to carry out what he had taken an oath to do. Now there was in that church a picture of our Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, which looked towards the East, and after the prayer which concluded the ser vice at midnight had been said, and the monks had de parted to their cells, that priest was wont to go to the picture and to prostrate himself before it several times ; and having saluted the Virgin Mary with the salutation of the angel [Gabriel] three hundred times, he would entreat her to restore to him the sight of his eyes. And he continued to act in this wise for a whole year. And it came to pass that, at the end of a complete year, on a certain night, as he was singing the salutation of the angel according to his wont, and was standing before the picture of our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, drowsiness overtook him and he fell straightway into a deep sleep. And he had a dream, and in it he saw a most beautiful woman come forth from the picture, and she shone with a light that was seven times brighter than that of the sun. And she drew nigh unto him and took out her breasts from inside her apparel, and she pressed milk out from them upon his eyes; and then she made the sign of the Cross over him with her holy hands and disappeared into the picture. And straightway his eyes were opened, and he saw the Eikon burning with fire, and he found in his eyes milk that gave forth sweet fragrance. And he cried out, saying, ""Hail to thee, O thou who art full of grace! God is with thee""; and when the monks heard his cry they came unto him quickly, so that they might know what had happened. And the priest told them everything that he had seen, and they looked at his eyes and saw traces of the milk in them, and they laid their hands upon his eyes and saluted him. Then they went to the picture of our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, and each one of them bowed down before her, and they prostrated themselves before her as long as they were able to do so. And John the priest performed the ser vice of the consecration of the Eucharist on that day, and he administered the Holy Mysteries unto the monks and the laity. And he lived twenty years after this, and he continued to minister in the church, and he died in peace. Thou didst accept his petition and didst give him of thy spiritual milk, Wherewith thou didst unseal the eyes of John the aged.

And our holy Lady Mary was wont to hold converse with a certain priest in dreams, and she said unto him, ""Build me a church on the edge of the stream."" And she continued to speak unto him in this wise for many years, and although he spake unto the monks and unto all the people they would not do as he wished. And it came to pass that, when they refused to build a church to the Virgin in the place wherein she wished, the church of the monastery, and the wall there of, and the cells of the monks, split asunder. Then the whole building moved down to the edge of the stream, and by the might of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the inner part thereof was made strong, and the church and the walls, and the cells of the monks, became firm and stable, even as they were aforetime, and the fair appearance of the church, and of its wall, and of the cells of the monks was unchanged. Now the monks who dwelt in that monastery were exceedingly numerous, and they were fast asleep on the night in which the church moved out of its place, and they knew nothing whatsoever about it until the following morning, when they went out from their cells and saw the stream in their courtyard, and all the monks uttered loud outcries and were astonished with a mighty astonishment. And they sent to the great folk of the city, and they all came, both male and female, and they marvelled when they saw this miracle, the like of which hath never been done either before or since. And they made a great feast, and they offered offerings and gave alms and oblations each year on the thirteenth day of the month Nahasse. Now the name of the monastery was 'Akona.

And when the people saw him they seized him and questioned him, saying unto him, ""Whence comest thou?"" And he answered and said unto them, ""I am from the city of Muslims""; and they laid hold of him and took him to the king of Ketalan. And the king answered and said unto him, ""By whose authority hast thou come unto this city?"" And the man said, ""I have no authority whatsoever. I come only to buy and to sell."" And the king answered and said unto him, ""Dost thou imagine that thou canst plunder here?"" And the king said to his servants, ""Go ye, take him to the prison house, and bind him and put fetters on his hands and feet."" And he dwelt for a space of seven years in great tribulation and affliction; now there is no place of imprisonment in this world more cruel than the city of Greece (?), and the man continued to live in affliction, and he wept, and after seven years it was impossible for him to be helped. Now there was a church [there built] in the name of our Lady Mary, and he saw miracles worked there, and the people brought gifts into it. And on that day the Muslim vowed a vow to our Lady Mary, saying, ""If thou wilt deliver me from this tribulation I will become a Chris tian slave."" And she appeared unto him in a dream in the form of a majestic woman, and she said unto him, ""Cast away thy fetters, and go to thy country, and perform what thou hast vowed."" And the man did not know her, and she appeared three days. Then he rose up and did what she commanded him, and his iron fetters fell off from his hands and feet, and he departed. And he journeyed for two days carrying his fetters, and he came to 'Iyariko and found a ship ready to sail to the country of Jerusalem. And he said to the captain, ""Give me a passage in thy ship""; and the captain of the ship said unto him, ""Give me my passage money""; and the Muslim said, ""I have no passage money, but I will become one of thy sailors."" And the captain said, ""Embark""; and he embarked on the ship. And the crew thought that he was a poor man without any money, but he was rich and was an officer of the Sultan of Egypt. And they departed and came to Jerusalem, and he removed himself and went to Gethsemane, to the grave of our Lady Mary. And his kinsfolk said unto him, ""Why dost thou not go into thy house?"" And he said unto them, ""I cannot go into my house until I have performed what I have vowed."" And then he came and pitched his tent in the Field of Olives where they seized our Lord when they crucified Him. And he came to the tomb of our Lady Mary, and fell down upon his face on the ground, and he groaned and embraced her tomb, and he related to the people what had happened unto him. And the Muslims were wroth with him, and they said unto him, ""Why didst thou not tell us on our journey? And why speakest thou among the Christians?"" And then he said, ""I will not deny the gracious act that God wrought for me through the prayer of Mary""; and he fixed the fetter on the wall of the house at the head of the tomb. And he remained there for two days giving alms to the poor and needy, and then fearing the Muslims he went out by night and departed to the Island of Cyprus. And he left his wife and children, and all his house and kinsfolk, and came to a priest and told him everything that had befallen him in the land of Greece, and how the Lady Mary had delivered him. And she appeared unto him, and then the priest baptized him in the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, and he waxed strong and declared the glory of our Lady Mary until he died.

48,The rich man from Colosse who was wounded in the eye while fighting the Qwez.,,,LIT3601Miracle,"XV THE VIRGIN MARY AND THE GREEK WHOSE EYE HAD BEEN PIERCED BY AN ARROW [A. Fol. 30a, 1; B. Fol. 57a, 1.] NOW there was a certain man on the Island of Kualasyas who was exceedingly rich, and he set out in a ship with certain Turks (?) to fight against pirates who attacked him on the sea-coast; and the crew of the pirate's ship shot eleven arrows at him, and one of these smote him in the eye, and he became grievously sick and was nigh unto death. Then he said unto his men, ""Take me to my house""; and they brought him to his house. Now the ten arrows that had entered his body came out, but the one that was in his eye would not come out, and when they pulled at it, it broke and left the iron [point] in his eye. And there was in this place a certain church which was built in the name of our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, and she used to work miracles and wonders therein and to heal those who were sick; and when those who were travelling by sea and by land made entreaty unto her she was wont to deliver them immediately. And the wounded man said, ""Carry me to the house of our Lady Mary, for there is no one that can cure me except her""; and they carried him thither straightway. And they made an image of wax—for thus is the custom of the Greeks— that resembled him in appearance, and they brought eleven arrows, and stuck them into it, ten in the members of the body, and one in the eye. Now when a man was wounded either by a spear or [by an arrow from] a bow, they used to bring the spear and make a wound in the wax figure, similar to that which had been made in the man; and then, when they had made vows to our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, she used to heal him. So they brought the rich man to the church of our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, and he made numerous gifts to the poor and needy, and he gave that which was meet for the church itself. And it came to pass that, when our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, saw that the confidence of his heart was in her, she plucked the arrow out of the eye of the waxen figure and out of the eye of the wounded man in the same night; and the eye of the wounded man became once more like its fellow. And when the people saw the eye of the man and that of the figure, they marvelled at the greatness of this miracle which our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, the God-bearer, had wrought, and they praised her exceedingly. O Mary, the life of those who are sick, who didst heal the wound of The rich Greek whose eye had been pierced by a dart, As I proclaim thy wondrous deed so that men may understand thy marvellous act, Make my heart to expand with joy, and let me have health, So that after everything hath come to an end I may hold converse [with thee].

And it came to pass that there was in that room a certain man who had lain there sick for many days, and each day he used to speak unto our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, saying, ""O my Lady, thou wilt never be able to raise me up unless I can come to the city of Jerusalem and worship at the place where on the foot of our Lord stood."" And whilst he was making entreaty in this wise our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, appeared unto him by night, and said unto him, ""Be not sad, but come so that I may trans port thee to the place where thou hast longed and de sired to be."" And straightway she carried him to Jerusalem where our Lord was buried, and to Bethlehem where He was born, and to the Jordan wherein He was baptized; and straightway she dipped the sick man in the water, and she made him go to the Mount of Olives, and to Mount Zion where our Lord abode with His disciples. And she said unto him, ""Rejoice and be glad, for I have fulfilled for thee everything which thou hast asked of me, and after the Festival of the Nativity I will take thee unto myself."" And at that moment the sick man rejoiced greatly, and he died in peace, even as our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, promised him.

Fol. 35b, 1.] NOW there was a certain poor widow whose husband had died and had left three daughters: the name of the first was Mary, and that of the second Martha, and that of the third Yawahita. And their mother was exceedingly poor, and lacked even the daily bread unless the people gave it unto her; and it came to pass that, when her three daughters had grown up and were of the proper age to marry, no man of that city thought of marrying them because of their poverty. Now their mother was exceedingly grieved because of this thing, and she went into the church of our holy Lady, the twofold Virgin, Mary, which was in Sen'a, and is called Tayada, weeping bitterly. And she stood up before the picture of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, and said, ""O Lady, I have brought up these my daughters until this day, but behold, I now lack by reason of my poverty the means for giving them in marriage, and I have no power to do anything whatsoever. O thou mother of orphans, remove my sorrow."" And in that same night our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, appeared unto her, and said unto her, ""This night I will take thine eldest daughter unto myself so that she may be with me, for she is a pledge committed unto me. And as concerning thy two other daughters I will send them unto Tewog, the blacksmith of the town of Makmas, who shall receive them from thee and shall marry them to his sons."" And when the woman awoke from her sleep she believed the words of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary. And after three days, the eldest daughter, whose name was Mary, died. And when the neighbours heard that she was dead they came to make her ready for burial and to bury her, and they saw that her mother was rejoicing and was not weeping at all. Then one of those who had come to comfort her said unto her, ""Why dost thou harden thy heart, and why dost thou not weep for thy daughter?"" And she made known unto her what our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, had said unto her in the vision, and they ascribed praise unto the glorious and Most High God, and unto the Virgin who had given Him birth, the merciful intercessor for the sons of men. And they buried the maiden Mary with great honour. And after a few days Tewog, the blacksmith, came from the city of Mekmas, and took the two daughters and gave them in marriage unto his sons. And he himself undertook the provision of marriage portions for them, for the sake of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, and her Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, who were with Joseph and Salome when they went to the land of Egypt. Now the history of the blacksmith is written in the Homily on our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, which is read on the sixth day of the month Hadar, on the festival of Kuesquam. O Mary, thou Queen, with all thy children Who make their boast of thee, thou mother of Israel. [Like] Rebecca The barren woman, thou didst make the woman to conceive a heavy burden, being in sore straits.

Fol. 33b, 1.] NOW there was a certain man in the country of Upper Egypt, who was surnaraed ""Badraman,"" and whose name was ""Abraham,"" and the name of his wife was ""Gera Anest""; and they were exceedingly rich in possessions, and they were perfect in every good work. And they had a daughter whose name was ""Elisabeth,"" and besides her they had no other child; and this daughter fell ill of a most loathsome disease in her body, that is to say, small-pox, and both her eyes became blind. And when her father and her mother saw the blindness of their daughter's eyes they were bitterly grieved, and they took her round to all the physicians and to all those men who dealt in magic, but they were not able to cure her. And it came to pass that when the day of the festival of our holy Lady, the twofold Virgin, Mary, that is to say, the twenty-first day of the month Tekemt (October 18), had come, her father and mother took the girl, together with many gifts, and carried her to the church of our holy Lady, the twofold Virgin, Mary, which was in the country called Dalga. Now the people of that country were wont to celebrate on that day a great festival in honour of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary; therefore the mother took her there on the twentieth day of the month Tekemt. And they went into the church and shut the door upon herself, and she stood up before the picture of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, and she stretched out her hands in the fervour of her heart, and said with bitter tears, ""O my Lady, thou mother of mercy, thou gracious intercessor, I take refuge in thee, and I entreat thee to save my daughter and to open her eyes."" And it came to pass that after she had made an end of her prayer she and her daughter straightway fell asleep under the picture [of the Virgin]. And as the daughter was sleeping with her mother, our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, appeared unto the daughter and woke her up without her mother knowing about it. Then our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, who is full of mercy, said unto her, ""Open thine eyes."" And when the maiden had opened them, the Virgin blew into them a breath from her pure mouth, and sprinkled upon her from her breasts some drops of her milk of healing and mercy; and straightway the eyes of the maiden were opened. Now our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, appeared unto her apparelled in light that was brighter than that of the sun, and then she disappeared into the picture. Then the girl awoke her mother and told her everything that had happened, and how our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, had appeared unto her, and how she had opened her eyes and disappeared into the picture; and when her mother looked at her she rejoiced exceedingly, and she uttered cries of joy in a loud voice. And the over seer of the church heard her as he was taking the bread for the Offering, and he came out to see what had happened, and he found the maiden with her mother, and she was able to see. And straightway he marvelled and was astonished, and he gave thanks unto God Almighty and to the Virgin, the merciful intercessor, who gave Him birth. And it came to pass in the morning that all the people were gathered together in the church, and when they saw this miracle they gave praise unto the glorious and Most High God. And they gave praise unto our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-bearer, and they made a great feast and glorified her name exceedingly. For the daughter of the rich man who had become blind through small-pox, Thou didst make the eyes to have light when, having journeyed to thee, she made entreaty unto thee.

And a certain man came unto one of them and asked him to write for him a copy of the Book of the Miracles of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, and that brother said, ""I consent""; and he began to write. And whilst the brother was writing the Book one committed a sinful act, and the devils came and snatched up into the air him that was writing the Book of the Miracles of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary. Now those devils who had seized upon that brother did not know the brother [they were to seize], and one of them cried out and said, ""Throw this man into perdition."" And that brother was dismayed exceedingly and trembled, for he thought that he was going to be destroyed. And our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, came, arrayed in apparel that was like unto the colour of heaven, and she said unto the devils who were carrying that brother away, ""Why are ye carrying away this man to perdition, for he and his brother were to write the Book of my Miracles?"" And having said these words unto them, she delivered the man from their hands, and he came down little by little from the sky and returned unto the place where he was formerly. And when the man awoke from his sleep he marvelled at the vision which he had seen, and he told his companions everything that had happened unto him, and how the devils had come upon him, and how our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-bearer, had de livered him. Then the man repented with a great repentance and saved himself from perdition. Unto thee turned from the unseemly path of error The two brethren who were wont to write thy name.

And it came to pass that being in prison, having been condemned by the judges to suffer there for many days, one day he fell asleep suddenly. And on the twenty-fifth day of the month Genbot, at the eleventh hour of the night, our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, came into the prison-house in the form of a dove, and with her outspread wings covered over the place in his head where the wound was. And he woke up straightway, and raised up his hands in the air and took hold of her wings, and she flew out of the prison-house and de parted; now she was shining with splendour like the sun. And as soon as she had laid her hands upon his head George knew that he had been made whole, and a mighty strength came into his body; and he rejoiced greatly and was exceedingly glad, because she had graciously bestowed upon him health and healing. And he remained without eating and drinking for four days, because of the exceedingly great joy that filled his heart through the beauty and sweet odour of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-bearer.

And the verger of the church was an evil-disposed, ill-natured man who said unto Katir in the church, ""Thou dwellest here and dost make offerings for the Eucharist, and thou dost consume whatever offerings are made to the church; get thee gone and remove thyself from the church."" And the priest said unto him, ""O my brother, I am a poor old man, canst thou not see my infirmity? Behold, I have ministered in the church for forty years, and now my strength hath failed me. O my lord, suffer me to abide [here] because of my infirmity."" And the verger of the church was exceedingly angry with him. Then the priest answered and said unto him, ""Have patience with me for three days. The monks of the Monastery of Victor, the son of Hermanos, are coming, and I will ask them to take me away with them."" Now these monks were in the habit of coming to Elksus on the eve of the first day of the week with incense and lights. And when the priest had said these words he wept exceedingly, and said, ""O my holy Lady, thou Virgin Mary, it is now a period of forty years that I have ministered in thy church, and wilt thou forsake me this day?"" And by reason of his abundant weeping he fell asleep. And at midnight our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, appeared unto the verger of the church, and, according to the words of the man himself, there were with her two men who shone with light. And she said unto the verger, ""Hast thou no mercy? What hath this poor priest done unto thee that thou shouldst wish to drive him out of the church, and to send him away?"" Then straightway she commanded one of [the two men] who stood before her to beat the feet of the verger (i.e. to bastinado him), and he did so, and our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, said unto the verger, ""Henceforth thou shalt be a paralytic, and the priest shall be healed."" And it came to pass that when the morning had come the verger of the church was unable [to move], and he could not stand up on his feet; but the aged priest had renewed his strength and had become strong. Now this thing that had come to pass through our Lady Mary was not known until the verger himself declared the matter with his own words. And all the people who saw it marvelled exceedingly, and they ascribed blessings unto our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the Godbearer. So the priest continued to minister in the sanctuary, and the guardian continued to be a paralytic until he died.

They were wont to bring everyone who came [to visit] the church of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-bearer, which was in that city, to pass the night with them in their house, and they provided him with the evening meal. And it came to pass that one day a certain evil-natured man, a Muhammadan whose name was Akyatar, came unto them, and said, ""Dye for me these garments and I will give you payment for the same""; and Nazib took the garments from the Muhammadan, and dyed them for him, but he took no payment from him. Then the Muhammadan said unto him, ""Ye are good Chris tian men; alas, that ye will not hearken unto our Prophet!"" And Nazib answered and said unto him, ""Your Prophet did not come unto us that we should listen unto him, but our Prophet [Jesus] did come unto the Arabs."" Then straightway the Muhammadan rose up and kissed the head of Nazib, and said unto him, ""Your testimony is true; our Prophet came only to the Arabs."" And the Muhammadan departed and made an accusation against Nazib to the Kadi, and said unto … [poor scan quality] Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933. One Hundred and Ten Miracles of Our Lady Mary, p. 65.

Fol. 74a, 1.] THERE was a certain man in the city of Jerusalem who was a Roman prefect, and he came to pray at the tomb of our Lord Jesus Christ; and when he wished to enter the tomb, a horned animal in the form of a ram rushed out to butt him with his horns, and he was afraid to turn round. Then the priest who was in charge of the tomb and those who were with him said unto him, ""What hath happened unto thee, O master, that thou goest not in?"" And he said unto the priest, ""Why didst thou bring a ram in here?"" And when those who were there went in they told the priest not to bring in the ram. And when the prefect drew nigh a second time, the ram attacked him again, but no one saw the ram except the prefect. Then the priest said unto him, ""Tell me, O master, if there be anything connected with thee that preventeth thee from entering. If thou dost believe in God, advance; peradventure He Who sheweth thee this miracle desireth thy salvation."" And the prefect confessed his sins, and wept and wished to enter, but the ram prevented him. Then the priest of the tomb said unto him, ""Is there any matter concerning thee that holdeth thee back?"" And the prefect said unto him, ""Peradventure it is because I am one of the Council of Judges."" And when the prefect declared his belief [in God] he went in and partook of the Body and Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ. And he forsook the habits in which he had formerly indulged, and accepted with firm confidence the Holy Faith of the Church. And he believed on our holy Lady, Mary the twofold Virgin, the God-bearer, who is the Mother of the Ram of Mystery, whose Son in the form of the Ram of God, the Merciful One, Who provideth means for the salvation of men, kept him back when he would have entered into the tomb [of our Lord]. O my Lady, He hath set thee for the salvation of the whole world, for God the Lord put on the flesh of man through thee in the land of mortal beings, and He sent forth life, and pursued after sin, and drove away the darkness. O my Lady, I adjure thee by the Might of the Most High which overshadowed thee, and by the Son Who became incarnate by thee, and by the Holy Spirit Who came upon thee and sanctified thee, and Who placed Himself on thine heart like a ring, and like a seal upon thine arm, to protect me for ever and ever.

Fol. 105a, No. 83.] THERE were certain men of arrogant minds who wanted to have sculptured a figure of our Lady Mary, the enemy of the arrogant, and they gave a fine stone to the stonecutter, and they prepared for it gold wherein to set the stone, and they commanded him to engrave for them a picture of our Lady Mary upon a tablet of sapphire plated (or, framed) with gold. Now they wished the work to be of the finest—though their heart was not good—but not because it was what our Lady expected, for they only worked for their own glorification. And our Lady Mary, the enemy of the arrogant, who loveth those who love her in righteous ness, appeared unto the cutter of the picture whilst he was asleep by night, and she said unto him, ""Take good heed to thyself that thou prayest not for these erring folk, for they wish to have a picture of me cut for ostentation, and not for reverent dedication. Their offering is not pleasing unto me, even as David my father saith, Let not the oil of the sinful anoint my head.""1 And she also appeared unto Abba Basil, and she said unto him, ""Come, and I will show thee my picture which hath been painted by the hand of the angels. It is in a holy and secret place, and it is a healing for those who recite salutations to it, and it straighteneth the feet of the lame, and it bestoweth light upon the blind, and it maketh whole those who suffer from leprosy and wounds."" And the Archbishop Basil awoke from his sleep and was perturbed because of the vision that he had seen of our Lady Mary appearing to him. And in the morning he set out with bishops, and priests, and deacons carrying censers and the cross, singing praises to God and His virgin mother, and when they had arrived at the place which our Lady Mary had told him about, they found the marks. And the Archbishop commanded the people to dig, and the bishops went round censing the place, and the deacons sang psalms and hymns. And whilst they were praying and digging, they came across a red tablet that resembled coal and on it was painted a picture of our Lady Mary with her Son, and olive oil dripped from that picture. And when those who were present saw this they rejoiced exceedingly, and the Archbishop placed the tablet in the church by the seat of the people, so that all those who believed in her prayer might salute her, and they decorated her with her tiara and her draperies. And all those who were sick and who saluted her were healed of their sickness, of whatsoever kind it was, and the lepers were cleansed as soon as they were anointed with the oil that flowed from the tablet, and great miracles took place. And there was a certain woman who had killed her sister by giving her a draught of deadly poison, because she was jealous of her for having slept with her husband. And one day this murderess came with the other people to salute the Virgin and to be anointed with the olive oil that came from her, and straightway leprosy seized her, and her flesh became white like marble, and all those who saw her marvelled and were astonished. And they asked her, saying, ""O woman, what hast thou done that maketh this kind of thing to appear on thee?"" And there was great awe that day because of that miracle and wonder at what our Lady Mary had done, and no man made an offering to that picture. Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933.

Fol. 43a, 1.] NOW there was a man in a certain city of the Franks (i.e. in Europe) who had a lame foot, and he used to cover up his foot with cloth so that people might not know [that he was lame]; and he continued to weep and lament day and night without ceasing. And he loved to betake himself early in the morning to the church of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-bearer, which was in that city and which was decorated with gold and silver, and precious stones, and hyacinthine stone. And it came to pass one day that a great multitude of people were gathered together in that church, and the man who had a lame foot came also with them. And as they were going out, the Arch bishop came and found him near the entrance (?) of the church, and he was angry and said, ""Who hath been into this church?"" And he said unto the people, ""Come back, all of you, and do not depart""; and they all returned. Then again the Archbishop said unto them, ""Get ye out, one at a time""; and the people did as he had commanded them. And it came to pass that when the people had gone out one by one, the man with the lame foot was the only person left there. And he prostrated himself before the picture (or, image) of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, and tears flowed from his eyes, and he wept with a bitter weeping; and straightway his lame foot was loosed, and he became whole like the [other] men. Now when the people saw him they were amazed and held their peace. And the Archbishop beckoned to the man [to come to him], and said unto him, ""How long hadst thou been in that state?"" And the man replied, ""From the time that I came forth from my mother's womb my foot was in that state, and I used to wrap it up in linen that the people might not know [that I was lame]; and I used to weep by day and by night, and I made supplication unto our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, unceasingly. When I came into the church this day thou wast angry with all [the people] because of my sin, and thou didst say unto them, 'Go forth one by one,' and they came back; and the lot went forth for me and I alone was left [there]. Then straightway I bowed down before the picture of our Lady, and I wept much, and forth with my foot was loosed."" Now when the Archbishop heard him he found the matter hard to understand. And he and all the people went and prostrated themselves before the picture of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-bearer, and he ascribed praise unto God, the Glorious and Most High God, and rendered thanksgiving unto our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-bearer, who hath the power to do all things, to whom nothing is impossible, and who worketh wonders and miracles. When the man of the Franks committed himself to thy protection, Thou didst make whole his foot which was lame. O Mary, when I offer up unto thee the Offering, In my joy mingle thou not sorrow therewith, As men mingle water with the wine. Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933.

Mus. MS. Orient. No. 652. Fol. 110a, No. 87.] AND it came to pass that, after our Lady Mary had brought forth her beloved Son Jesus Christ, and whilst they were living in Bethlehem, Herod the king commanded [his men] to slay all the male children. And when His mother heard this she fled with the Child to the land of Egypt. And as she was journeying along thither the tribulations of the way came upon her, the heat of the sun, the cold of night, and hunger and thirst. And thirst which it is hard to describe seized her, and she asked Him, saying, ""O Lord of all creation, Thou fruit of my womb, I am exceedingly thirsty, give me water to drink just as Thou didst give Thy people water to drink by making it to flow from the rocks. If Thou wert not the King then the Wise Men would not have brought gold to present unto Thee, and the men of Persia would not have brought incense, and they would never have come to worship Thee if the star had not guided them."" And thus saying, she lifted Him up on her shoulders, and by His Godhead He brought forth water of the Garden (i.e. Paradise) which was as white as milk, and it flowed up about her feet and lapped them ; and when she saw this she gave thanks to the Holy Trinity. And after this our Lady Mary drank, and Joseph and Salome drank. And the Child said, ""This water is established until I come in My glory""; but only His mother heard these words. And after they had drunk they rested a little. And the daughter of a thief, who was blind and leprous, came along the road, and mercy drew her, and she put her foot in the water, and she speedily saw the light and was cleansed of her leprosy, and she saw our Lady Mary with the Child and with Joseph and Salome. And she said unto them, ""Who are you?"" And Mary said unto her, ""I am Mary, and [this is] my Son Jesus Christ."" And the daughter of the thief said unto her, ""I believe in thy Son Jesus Christ, and in thy prayer""; and thus saying she worshipped her, and then she returned to her house. And when the men of the city saw her they were astonished, and they said unto her, ""Who healed thee?"" And her brother Yoset also asked her, and she told him, and he said, ""Yesterday I met them on the road, and I took away the Child from His mother, and the odour of His apparel scented me like the odour of sovereignty, and it was diffused in my garments, and to-day the sweet odour of His perfume is fixed therein."" It was this thief who devoured eight and seventy souls, and he, Yoset, was the thief on the right hand. They had the same father and the same mother, and Mary, of the sweet unguent, was their father's sister. And it came to pass after the death of our Lady Mary that the second thief, after slaying and shedding blood, came to that water that sprang up under the feet of our Lady Mary. And he washed away the sweat [caused by] the sun, and he drank, and the water washed over the stone under his head and his sword and his spear, and he fell asleep. And the other thief came to wash there, and when he saw his companion asleep, he took up his sword and cut off his head and he died straight way. And the angels of darkness came and carried him away, shaking his soul as they went. And our Lady Mary came and said, ""This soul belongeth to me""; and the angels of darkness said unto her, ""He neither spared the righteous nor the rich."" And our Lady Mary went and bowed down before our Lord and said unto Him, ""Have mercy upon me, my Son, have mercy upon me."" And our Lord said unto her, ""Mercy is not fitting for him that is drenched in the blood of men."" And our Lady Mary said, ""He who hath washed in the water of the Garden which Thou didst make to spring up hath come to Thee."" And the Lord said unto her, ""For him who hath washed in the water of the Garden which I made to spring up under thy feet the punishment of death is not seemly. Let them wash him again in the water of life and bring him into the Garden (i.e. Paradise)."" And the hosts of angels prostrated themselves, saying, ""Glory be to God Who hath pleasure in man."" And it came to pass that after our Lord Jesus Christ had ascended into heaven, the thief who had killed his companion came and fell asleep in that water of the Garden, and his wish was to be washed therein. And another thief came and saw the chief of the thieves washing, and he said in his heart, ""I will kill my companion on the road, and will cut off his shoulder whilst he is washing."" And as he meditated thus, the thief turned his face and looked at him, and saw him with his head cloth stripped off him. And he ran like a stag, and seized him, and killed him, and returned to the water, and washed again and drank. And he said in his heart, ""This is the water which healed my mother long ago, and cleansed her leprosy, and removed the darkness of her eyes. And now I myself will believe in the prayer of Mary."" And having said this, he set himself by the side of the water, and he placed his spear and his sword under his head and fell asleep. And the daughter of the thieves came to that water that had sprung up under the feet of our Lady Mary—now she was ugly of face, and the form of her body was emaciated, and she was weak and infirm—and she looked at the chief of the thieves lying asleep, and she drew out his sword from his belt and cut off his head. And the hand of God was upon her supporting her, and she remembered what Isaiah, the beloved prophet, had said, ""Blood shall not be cleansed except by blood."" And the other thief came and saw that murderess; and standing afar off he transfixed her with his spear, and she died, and she was made innocent at the water by which she had slain the chief of the thieves, who had never shown mercy on anyone. And quickly came the frightful and terrifying angels of darkness, and they carried away his soul and shook it in a way that ten men could not describe, and they brought it into the third heaven. And our Lady Mary came and said, ""This soul belongeth to me""; and those angels of darkness said unto her, ""There is no man under heaven who hath committed sin as this man hath done."" And our Lady Mary went to our Lord Jesus Christ, and bowed low before Him, saying, ""Have mercy upon me, O fruit of my womb""; and our Lord answered His mother never a word because of the great sin of that man. And again she bowed low before Him, saying, ""Have mercy upon me, O my Son, Whose word can never be made a lie""; and the Lord spake not to her. And she bowed low the third time, saying, ""O Thou Whose word cannot be made a lie, have mercy upon me. He said, I believe in the prayer of Mary, and fell asleep."" And our Lord Jesus Christ said unto her, ""Him who hath remembered thee and invoked thy name, whether he be a righteous man or whether he be a sinner, I will have mercy on him."" And thus saying He had mercy upon him and said, ""Wash him in the water of life, and bring him into the Garden."" O our Lady Mary, may thy prayer and thy petition be with us for ever. Budge, E. A.

Fol. 44b, 1.] NOW there was a certain bishop whose name was Mercurius, and his whole body was covered with leprosy. And one day he went unto the Archbishop Zacharias, and when the Archbishop saw him, he touched him and said unto him gently and graciously, ""O my brother, it is not seemly for thee to minister as a priest with this disease upon thee, unless our Lord Jesus Christ remove it from thee—for the Book calleth a man with leprosy unclean"" (Leviticus xiii. 44, 45). And when Bishop Mercurius heard him he wept much, and said unto him, ""O my father, help me with thy prayers."" Then he departed from him, and went and entered into the church unto which he had been ap pointed, and he stood up before the picture of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-bearer, and he wept, and made supplication unto her that she would cleanse him of his leprosy. And this he continued to do from the morning of the second day of the week until the ninth hour of the fourth day of the week, and he prayed many prayers unceasingly. Now at the time of the ninth hour of the fourth day of the week he became wearied, and he placed his head in a position of rest, and as he was resting he straightway fell asleep. And he saw in a dream that the hand of the picture (or, image) of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, reached out and rubbed his flesh. And he awoke immediately, and found that his body had been cleansed from his leprosy, and he rejoiced with great joy, and praised God, the Glorious and Most High God, and made thanksgiving unto our Lady, the twofold Virgin, Mary, the Godbearer, because she had graciously vouchsafed unto him mercy. Thou didst cleanse Mercurius from his leprosy, And didst heal him completely of the disease that consumed him.

MS. Orient. No. 652. Fol. 4b.] THERE was a man in a certain city who was very rich, and he celebrated the commemoration of our Lady, the Virgin Mary, and he used to attend the Eucharist on her days [of festival]. He did nothing else which was good, for he neither gave alms nor had com passion on the poor, and he was ill-tempered towards his slaves. And one day, that is to say, the 21st day of Ter, he went to attend the Eucharist, and when he was going out he said unto his servants, ""Make ready for me the upper storey, lay down carpets, and decorate it with linen draperies""; and they did so. And when he went up to the upper floor they brought to him meats and drinks of every kind, and he ate. And before he had satisfied his hunger and filled his belly, a poor man, a hungry beggar, cried out under the window, saying, ""Have pity upon me, master, for I am very hungry."" And the rich man took up a dry loaf of bread and in a rage threw it to him, saying, ""Take this, then, for the sake of Mary's name."" And the loaf split the beggar's head open, and the blood ran down over his face, but the beggar did not feel the blood because of the keen ness of his hunger, and he departed thanking the rich man, and he hurried off to a place which otherwise he could not have reached. Hearken now, O my brethren. Before this rich man had finished his meal he died suddenly, and his wife and children wept for him. And the angels came and took him before God, and our Lady the Virgin Mary came straightway that she might hear the judgement. And God said, ""Take this soul into Sheol."" And our Lady the Virgin Mary said, ""This soul is mine""; and God said, ""What hath it done for thee?"" And she said, ""This day he satisfied a beggar with food for my name's sake."" And God said unto her, ""What did he give him? Was it not blood?"" And our Lady said, ""Command them to bring this beggar here."" And straightway they brought him there, and when the beggar saw the rich man, he said, ""O thou who didst fill me with food for Mary's name's sake, have they brought thee hither?"" And God said unto the beggar, ""What did he give thee? Was it not blood?"" And the beggar said, ""I did not feel the blood."" And God said, ""Let the soul return to its body""; and straightway our Lady Queen Mary and the angels bowed down and wor shipped. And that man who was saved by the prayer of Mary was acceptable unto God all the days of his life. Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933. One Hundred and Ten Miracles of Our Lady Mary, pp. 305-306.

Fol. 119a, No. 100.] NOW there was a certain Egyptian woman whose name was Mary, and this holy woman was a native of Egypt and came from Alexandria, and her parents were Christians. And when she was twelve years old, the Enemy of the human race led her astray, and seduced her, and made her his net wherein he snared an innumerable number of souls. And she gave her body to harlotry without payment, because of her love of this destroying sin. And she lived this life of defilement for sixteen years. And God, the lover of the race of men, caused her to see certain men who wished to travel to the city of Jerusalem in order to be blessed there at the tomb of our Lord Jesus Christ, and she was moved in her mind to go with them. And she embarked in a ship together with many people, and the sailors said unto her, ""Pay us the hire of the ship."" Now she had no money to give them, so she gave herself over to them that they might commit fornication with her, in lieu of the hire of the ship. And when she came to the city of Jerusalem she did the same thing, and she committed fornication continually. And whensoever she wished to enter the door of the tomb of our Lord Jesus Christ, the power of the Divinity prevented her from going in; and although she tried to enter several times she was unable to do so, and she concluded that it was her filthy sin that prevented her entrance. And being sad and sorrowful she lifted up her eyes to heaven, and she saw a picture of our Lady Mary, and she wept before it, and made supplication, saying, ""O Intercessor for all Christian people, O Mother of God, take me into thy keeping. Since I came [here] I have wished to celebrate thy festival like all other people: I will do what thou commandest me."" And when she had said these words, weeping as she said them, she passed in quickly into the church of the tomb of our Lord Jesus Christ. And when she had celebrated the festival, she went back to the picture of our Lady Mary, and she prayed a long prayer 'before it, and she shed bitter tears, and she entreated her to send her to any place she wished so that she might save her soul. And a voice came forth from the picture, which said, ""If thou wilt go into the desert of Jordan thou shalt find rest and salvation."" And she accepted that advice, and prayed at the picture of our Lady Mary, and departed. And as she was going out she met a certain man who gave her one hundred pieces of small brass money, and with them she bought bread. And she crossed the river Jordan and dwelt there for seven and thirty years, fighting a great spiritual fight, and Satan waged war against her by means of the filthy lust which she had in the days gone by when he toiled therein. And she used to fast every ten days and every ten nights, and she pleased our Lady Mary, and she died in peace. And after she died Zosimus the priest found a written roll placed under her head, saying, ""Bury poor Mary in the dust from which she was taken."" And he saw at her feet a lion guarding her. And he wondered, saying, ""With what shall I dig her grave?"" And the lion came and dug the grave, and Zosimus buried her. This sinful woman was saved from Sheol by the prayer of our Lady Mary; may Mary in like manner save from a death in sin Gabra Lokos! Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933.

Fol. 46a, 1.] THERE was a certain church in the city of Harlom (Haarlem?), and in it was a coloured picture of our holy Lady, the twofold Virgin, Mary, the Godbearer, which people called the ""Helper."" And there was among the inhabitants of the city a certain poor woman who had broken her foot, and she had nothing whatsoever of this world's goods to give to a physician to heal her. Then her kinsfolk lifted her up and brought her to that church, and they laid her down before the picture of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-bearer, and they left her there by herself and departed; and the verger of the church locked the doors upon her and she was left inside. Now our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, used to come constantly to that church, and to wander up and down therein, and to walk about in it the whole night long, and when the vergers of the church opened the doors [for service] about the hour of midnight they would find her there in visible form. And it came to pass that, on the night whereon they had left the woman with the broken foot in the church, our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, came there according to her wont, and she found her lying before her picture; and she made a sign over her with her foot and said unto her, ""Rise up."" Then straight way the woman rose up and stood upon her feet, and she was sound and whole. And at the season of mid night the verger of the church opened the doors and went in, and he found the woman standing up and he said unto her, ""What hath happened unto thee? And who hath made thee whole?"" Then the woman said unto him, ""Our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, came with her face shining with a light which was brighter than that of the sun, and her garments were perfumed with the odours of sweet incense, and she made a sign over me with her foot, and said unto me, 'Rise up'; and straightway I rose up and stood upon my feet."" And all those who saw the woman who had been healed of her sickness gave thanks unto God, Who is to be thanked and praised, and they sang hymns in honour of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-bearer, who doeth wonderful things and worketh miracles; for she hath the power to do everything, and there is nothing which is impossible for her. Thou, O Mary, didst heal the infirmity of the woman with a broken foot When she with anxious care and thought made sup plication unto thee.

Fol. 106b, No. 84.] THERE was a certain virgin [who lived] with her mother, and a young man came and destroyed her virginity, and then many other young men came and she defiled herself with them. And when her mother heard this she wept and said unto her, ""O my daughter, why hast thou disgraced thyself and destroyed both worlds? Did I not deliver thy soul to the care of the heavenly bridegroom? Why hast thou separated thyself from thy companions? Why hast thou darkened thy light, O my daughter? Who hath clipped thy wings?"" And as she said these words tears poured from her eyes, and she said, ""O my daughter, didst thou not commit thyself to Mary, our Lady, that thou mightest celebrate her commemoration?"" And the daughter would not hearken to her voice, or receive her words, for Satan possessed her, and she dwelt in sin. And then one day when she was in her mother's house, the angel of death came, and she fell down, and as she lay she wept and said, ""Woe is me! I must now go to the Awful King. Woe is me! Woe is me! When the Wise One cometh He will be clothed in light, and I shall be clothed in darkness. Woe is me! Woe is me! When the Wise One cometh with joy and gladness I shall be sorrowful and in shame. Woe is me! Woe is me! What shall I answer? What shall I say? Behold, the angels of darkness will come and meet me with ugly faces; who will receive me kindly? ""And then the virgins her companions came to visit her, and she said unto them, ""O my sisters and friends, formerly I separated myself from you through my sins, and now I do so by my death. O my sisters, remember the love wherewith we loved each other in the days gone by when we walked together in the church at the season of prayer and of the Offering. Woe is me! Woe is me! Behold, O my sisters, I am going to everlasting weeping. Unto whom shall I cry and whom shall I invoke? Woe is me! Woe is me! O my sisters, come ye and weep for me, and reject me not because of my sin."" And as she said these words her tears flowed, and they watered her apparel and even the ground. And when she had said these words she spake unto them, saying, ""Ye shall not make ready my body for burial, neither shall ye lay it in the earth, but cast it forth so that the dogs and the wolves may devour me because of my sin."" And then her mother came and embraced her and said unto her, ""Woe is me! Woe is me! I rejoiced in thy childhood when I saw thee with the virgins thy companions, but now thou hast grown up thou hast made me sorrowful. Woe is me, O my daughter! Woe be to my belly which carried thee for nine months! Woe is me, the sorrowful one! Behold, my heart burneth like fire. Woe is me, O my daughter! Behold, thou art going to the king who is arrayed in fire."" And as she said these words her tears ran down upon the face of her daughter. And then she said, ""O my Lady Mary, I gave [her] to thee to be thy hand maiden and to celebrate thy commemoration; and now thou thyself knowest [what hath happened]."" And then her daughter said unto her, ""O my mother, behold, the whole world is too strait for me. Behold, the angels of darkness who will snatch me away have come. O my mother, hide me in thy bosom so that I may rest a little."" And great outcries arose in the habitation of the widows. And the virgins brought incense, and they took it in their hands, and they shed tears upon it until it was wetted with their tears, and they gave it to Theodore the Bishop so that he might burn it on behalf of this sinful girl their sister; and he prayed to our Lady Mary and offered up the incense. And when it was night our Lady Mary appeared unto a certain virgin and said, ""Bring me all the tears of this wretched girl, and the dust which she hath watered with her tears, and place them in one of the pans of a pair of scales, and bring thou also all her sins and put them into the other pan""; and she did so, and immediately the tears outweighed the sins. And then our Lady Mary said unto Michael, ""Take this girl away and dip her in the water of life three times, and place her among the virgins who are with me."" And when the girl awoke, she told the other virgins and the mother of the girl, and when they heard this they rejoiced and gave thanks unto God and to His mother the Holy Virgin. Budge, E. A.

114,The brigands who killed each other at the miraculous spring.,,,LIT5183MiracleBrigands,"[IDs 100, 101, and 114 are translated together (consecutively)] LXXIII THE VIRGIN MARY AND THE SOULS OF THE THIEVES [Brit. Mus. MS. Orient. No. 652. Fol. 110a, No. 87.] AND it came to pass that, after our Lady Mary had brought forth her beloved Son Jesus Christ, and whilst they were living in Bethlehem, Herod the king commanded [his men] to slay all the male children. And when His mother heard this she fled with the Child to the land of Egypt. And as she was journeying along thither the tribulations of the way came upon her, the heat of the sun, the cold of night, and hunger and thirst. And thirst which it is hard to describe seized her, and she asked Him, saying, ""O Lord of all creation, Thou fruit of my womb, I am exceedingly thirsty, give me water to drink just as Thou didst give Thy people water to drink by making it to flow from the rocks. If Thou wert not the King then the Wise Men would not have brought gold to present unto Thee, and the men of Persia would not have brought incense, and they would never have come to worship Thee if the star had not guided them."" And thus saying, she lifted Him up on her shoulders, and by His Godhead He brought forth water of the Garden (i.e. Paradise) which was as white as milk, and it flowed up about her feet and lapped them ; and when she saw this she gave thanks to the Holy Trinity. And after this our Lady Mary drank, and Joseph and Salome drank. And the Child said, ""This water is established until I come in My glory""; but only His mother heard these words. And after they had drunk they rested a little. And the daughter of a thief, who was blind and leprous, came along the road, and mercy drew her, and she put her foot in the water, and she speedily saw the light and was cleansed of her leprosy, and she saw our Lady Mary with the Child and with Joseph and Salome. And she said unto them, ""Who are you?"" And Mary said unto her, ""I am Mary, and [this is] my Son Jesus Christ."" And the daughter of the thief said unto her, ""I believe in thy Son Jesus Christ, and in thy prayer""; and thus saying she worshipped her, and then she returned to her house. And when the men of the city saw her they were astonished, and they said unto her, ""Who healed thee?"" And her brother Yoset also asked her, and she told him, and he said, ""Yesterday I met them on the road, and I took away the Child from His mother, and the odour of His apparel scented me like the odour of sovereignty, and it was diffused in my garments, and to-day the sweet odour of His perfume is fixed therein."" It was this thief who devoured eight and seventy souls, and he, Yoset, was the thief on the right hand. They had the same father and the same mother, and Mary, of the sweet unguent, was their father's sister. And it came to pass after the death of our Lady Mary that the second thief, after slaying and shedding blood, came to that water that sprang up under the feet of our Lady Mary. And he washed away the sweat [caused by] the sun, and he drank, and the water washed over the stone under his head and his sword and his spear, and he fell asleep. And the other thief came to wash there, and when he saw his companion asleep, he took up his sword and cut off his head and he died straight way. And the angels of darkness came and carried him away, shaking his soul as they went. And our Lady Mary came and said, ""This soul belongeth to me""; and the angels of darkness said unto her, ""He neither spared the righteous nor the rich."" And our Lady Mary went and bowed down before our Lord and said unto Him, ""Have mercy upon me, my Son, have mercy upon me."" And our Lord said unto her, ""Mercy is not fitting for him that is drenched in the blood of men."" And our Lady Mary said, ""He who hath washed in the water of the Garden which Thou didst make to spring up hath come to Thee."" And the Lord said unto her, ""For him who hath washed in the water of the Garden which I made to spring up under thy feet the punishment of death is not seemly. Let them wash him again in the water of life and bring him into the Garden (i.e. Paradise)."" And the hosts of angels prostrated themselves, saying, ""Glory be to God Who hath pleasure in man."" And it came to pass that after our Lord Jesus Christ had ascended into heaven, the thief who had killed his companion came and fell asleep in that water of the Garden, and his wish was to be washed therein. And another thief came and saw the chief of the thieves washing, and he said in his heart, ""I will kill my companion on the road, and will cut off his shoulder whilst he is washing."" And as he meditated thus, the thief turned his face and looked at him, and saw him with his head cloth stripped off him. And he ran like a stag, and seized him, and killed him, and returned to the water, and washed again and drank. And he said in his heart, ""This is the water which healed my mother long ago, and cleansed her leprosy, and removed the darkness of her eyes. And now I myself will believe in the prayer of Mary."" And having said this, he set himself by the side of the water, and he placed his spear and his sword under his head and fell asleep. And the daughter of the thieves came to that water that had sprung up under the feet of our Lady Mary—now she was ugly of face, and the form of her body was emaciated, and she was weak and infirm—and she looked at the chief of the thieves lying asleep, and she drew out his sword from his belt and cut off his head. And the hand of God was upon her supporting her, and she remembered what Isaiah, the beloved prophet, had said, ""Blood shall not be cleansed except by blood."" And the other thief came and saw that murderess; and standing afar off he transfixed her with his spear, and she died, and she was made innocent at the water by which she had slain the chief of the thieves, who had never shown mercy on anyone. And quickly came the frightful and terrifying angels of darkness, and they carried away his soul and shook it in a way that ten men could not describe, and they brought it into the third heaven. And our Lady Mary came and said, ""This soul belongeth to me""; and those angels of darkness said unto her, ""There is no man under heaven who hath committed sin as this man hath done."" And our Lady Mary went to our Lord Jesus Christ, and bowed low before Him, saying, ""Have mercy upon me, O fruit of my womb""; and our Lord answered His mother never a word because of the great sin of that man. And again she bowed low before Him, saying, ""Have mercy upon me, O my Son, Whose word can never be made a lie""; and the Lord spake not to her. And she bowed low the third time, saying, ""O Thou Whose word cannot be made a lie, have mercy upon me. He said, I believe in the prayer of Mary, and fell asleep."" And our Lord Jesus Christ said unto her, ""Him who hath remembered thee and invoked thy name, whether he be a righteous man or whether he be a sinner, I will have mercy on him."" And thus saying He had mercy upon him and said, ""Wash him in the water of life, and bring him into the Garden."" O our Lady Mary, may thy prayer and thy petition be with us for ever. Budge, E. A.

And then came two women whose hands were bedevilled, and they cried out to her, saying, ""Have mercy upon us, O Holy Mary, and heal us of our sickness."" And our Lady Mary prayed over them and blessed them, and straight way they were healed. And again an Egyptian woman came in a high fever, and she bowed low before our Lady Mary, and straightway she was healed of her fever. And again another woman, whose right eye had been blinded by a devil, came to our Lady Mary, and entreated her, saying, ""Have mercy upon me, O Lady Mary."" And she laid her hand upon her, and her eye was healed straightway from that very hour. And another woman came whom the devils tortured, and she cried out to our Lady Mary and said, ""Heal me, O my Lady Mary."" And our Lady stretched out her hand, and prayed, and said, ""I adjure you in the Name of Jesus Christ to go forth from this soul, and not to trouble her again."" And the devils went forth from her at that moment, and they cried out, saying, ""What have we to do with thee, Mary, Mother of God? Behold, we are scattered about in all lands through the greatness of the dominion of thy Son. We cannot stand before Him, and He hath brought us down into the depth of the earth. And thou, like Him, hast driven away from us this soul by thy prayer."" And at that moment our Lady Mary drowned them in the abyss of the sea. And then a multitude of sick folk came and gathered together in the house of God, and they asked, saying, ""Where is the blessed Mary?"" And they said unto them, ""She is not here; she liveth in Bethlehem."" And behold, many sick folk came and fell down on their faces at the door of the house of our Lady Mary, and they cried out with a loud voice, saying, ""O holy Mary, Mother of God, have mercy upon us, and heal us, and treat us not with contempt.""

Fol. 30a, 1.] NOW there was a certain man in the city of Kemer, and he was of noble race and was, in name, a Christian, but his sin was very great, and indeed it exceeded that of all other men, for he did not eat [ordinary] food and the flesh of oxen, but he lived upon human flesh. Now when the cannibal had devoured eight and seventy people among his friends, and his acquaintances, and his kinsfolk, and the men who were in his service, [victims] began to come to an end, for the men who remained had fled from him so that he might not be able to devour them; and he was left alone with his wife and his two children, and them also he ate. And it came to pass that, one day when he was walking on the road, he met a certain husbandman, and he lay in wait for him, and then followed him; and when he knew that the man would be too strong for him he left him and departed. And as he was turning away he said unto the husbandman, ""Sell me an ox, and behold I will give thee my bow which is plated with gold; take it."" And the husbandman said unto him, ""I refuse it wholly, for money and food are more useful to me; I will not give thee the ox."" Then the cannibal spake unto him a second time and said, ""I will also give thee arrows with the bow""; but the husbandman refused [to take them]. And the cannibal again spake to him, saying, ""Show me, I pray, the cave where thou dwellest""; and the husbandman said unto him, ""Behold [it] close by thee. Dost thou not dwell among the habitations of men?"" And he refused to shew him the cave, and as he was turning away he said unto the cannibal, ""Thou art of noble family, but thy heart is depraved and full of guile, and thou appearest to be like unto a rich man who hath his abode in the city of Kemer."" And the cannibal said unto him, ""Why dost thou compare me with such an one, O my brother?"" Then the cannibal took some water away in a drinking vessel, and as he was going along the road he met a certain poor beggar-man whose whole body was covered with the sores and scabs of leprosy; and he wanted to eat the poor man, but he did not like him because of his sores which were putrefying and which stank exceedingly. Now the beggar was thirsty and he begged for some water from the cannibal, and said unto him, ""Give me some water to drink, for God's sake""; but the cannibal became greatly enraged, and heaped abuse upon him. Then the beggar begged again for water for the sake of heaven and earth, and for the sake of the martyrs and the righteous men; but the cannibal re fused [to give him any]. And the beggar begged from him a third time, and said unto him, ""In the name of Mary, give me water to drink before my soul shall de part."" Then the cannibal said unto him, ""Verily, from my youth up, I have heard that she saveth by her prayers, therefore I myself will take refuge in her."" And he said unto the beggar, ""Take, and drink, for Mary's sake""; but when only a very little of the water had gone down his throat, that is to say, about a handful, the cannibal seized him, and before he was able to satisfy his thirst stopped him from drinking. Then the cannibal died, and the angels of darkness took his soul and cast it into Sheol. And our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-bearer, came unto the Son of God and said unto Him, ""Have compassion upon me, O my Son."" And He said unto her, ""What good thing hath he done for thee?"" And she said unto Him, ""He gave a thirsty man water to drinkin my name."" Then the Lord said, ""Bring forth the scales and weigh the souls that he hath devoured against the water that he gave the thirsty man to drink""; and they (i.e. the angels) weighed them, and the little drop of water outweighed the eight and seventy souls. And the angels of light who were looking on marvelled, and they gave shouts of joy because the cannibal was saved and was made to live through the entreaty of our holy Lady, Mary the twofold Virgin, the God-bearer, through whom all things come to pass. Thy love did save the evil-doing cannibal, Because the handful of water [given to] the beggar stood on his side.

Fol. 63a, No. 51.] THERE was a certain man in the city of Sidon who was the son of parents of exalted rank; he was akin to the royal family, and was in name a Christian, but he committed many sins, and was a notorious sinner among sinful men. Now he was exceedingly rich. And he did not know that God had created him, and he never called upon His Name; and he was a destroyer and a robber. And one day he took his weapons for the chase to go out to hunt in the desert of Scete. And when in the course of his hunting he entered into a dense mass of trees and thorny undergrowth and creepers, he came across a huge serpent that had come forth from its hole, and it gaped at him with its mouth and raised up its head to a height of fifteen cubits. Its eyes were like unto coals of fire, and its mane (or, hair) like [that of] a horse, and its tail like a spark (sic). And when the man saw him he was terrified, and at the moment when the serpent came towards him to swallow him up, he cried out with a loud voice, saying, ""O Mary, I have heard the story about thee, that thou art the deliverer of those who put their trust in thee, and that thou makest manifest thy wonderful deeds to those who believe on thee, O thou, of whose name those who are perishing, and those who are in captivity, and those who are in prison, and those who are on dry land, make mention, if thou wilt deliver me this day from this accursed serpent, the messenger of the Devil, by the might of thy Son Jesus Christ and by thy prayer, I will become thy servant, and I will minister to the Church until the day of my death."" And our Lady Mary made strong the heart of that man, and he took his bow and stretched it, and shot at the accursed serpent, and hit it with forty arrows, which were aimed with fury. And when the strength of the serpent failed and it fell down, the man took his shield and his spear, and he smote it on the head, and drew out its brain, and he found therein a very precious pearl which shone with great brilliance. And at that moment he heard a voice in the desert that said, ""O wandering man, attribute thy happy [escape] to Mary. Out of thy vast riches build thou a martyrium to her in the city of Sidon, and fix thou in the eastern chamber thereof this pearl which thou hast found in the head of the serpent, so that it may shine by night and give light unto those who dwell between the border of the plain of the mountain and the sea-shore, and it shall be a sign until the coming of her beloved Son. And call thou that church, 'The Sign of Mary.' "" And after this the man measured the length and the breadth of the serpent, and its length was 60 cubits (i.e. between 90 and 100 feet), and its breadth (circumference) 20 cubits (i.e., between 30 and 33$ feet). And those who saw this miracle which our Lady Mary had performed marvelled, and they gave thanks to God and to our Lady Mary. Now through that portion of the desert there ran a highway for caravans, with a market place at the end of it. And the people rejoiced greatly at the death of that serpent, for it used to attack and seize and swallow every living creature that it saw, from men to cattle and sheep, and the wild creatures of the desert, and the feathered fowl of the heavens, and it used to roar like a lion and go about seeking what it could devour. And our Lady Mary crushed its head by the might of her Son, and removed a reproach from men. And the man came to his house, and after a short time he built a church in the name of our Lady Mary, and he decorated it with fine ornaments, according to the rule of the Church. And he inserted that gem above the eastern chamber, and it shineth brightly until this day in the city of Sidon. And he gave all his wealth to our Lady Mary, and he continued to serve her, together with all the men of his house; and she gave him many days, and he lived happily until he reached old age. And his blessed children's children were the servants of our Lady Mary. Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933. One Hundred and Ten Miracles of Our Lady Mary, pp. 195-197. London: Oxford University Press, H.

Now he was a wise and understanding man, and because of their great love for him the people gathered together and said unto him, ""Thou knowest that thou art great, and dost rule to the uttermost ends of the earth, and that thy power is mighty; and behold, we love to serve and worship thee."" And he said unto them, ""This thing (i.e. adulation) is not seemly for me,"" and they began to weary him with their words. And he meditated in his heart and said, ""I am a man, a creature of the dust, and mortal, and it is not right for them to worship me like God, the Most High."" And he was sorrowful in his mind and knew not what to do. And he sent for a certain wise woman whose name was Sabela (Sybilla) who dwelt in that city, and when she had approached him he took her to his habitation privily, and told her what the people were saying about him and [how] they were wearying him. And she said unto him, ""Only wait for three days""; and she continued to beseech God, Who is to be praised! as to what he should do. And on the third day she saw a vision at noonday, the sun standing in the middle of the heavens with a ring of gold encircling it, and a virgin who was brighter than the sun, and in her lap was a little Child, Whose face was brighter than all lights. And the wise woman said unto the king, ""Look at the sun""; and the king lifted up his eyes to heaven, and God showed him everything according as the prophetess had seen. And the king said unto her, ""What is this vision? And who is the maiden, and who is the Child?"" And the wise woman said unto him, ""This Virgin is the altar of heaven, and the Child is the King of the heavens and the earth: He is God and man perfect, and to Him ser vice and worship are meet."" And the king said unto her, ""What sacrifice, and offering, and gift ought the people to offer unto Him?"" And the woman said unto the king, ""He loveth not offerings of beasts, but He doth love choice, fine and pure incense."" And the king commanded them forthwith to make an altar in his habitation, and he took pure incense and offered it up thereon, and he called it the "" Heavenly Altar."" And that altar existeth in the city of Rome to this day, and it is called the ""Heavenly Altar,"" and it was that which saved the king from wickedness that day. May the prayer of our Lady the holy Virgin to whom this great honour was fitting [be with us]! She was the abode of Him Whose praise is great.

Mus. MS. Orient. No. 652.

One day his enemies came upon him suddenly outside the town, and they killed him and left him lying there where he was. And some other people came along the road and found him, and having found him they buried him on the road-side. Forty days later our Lady Mary appeared to a deacon who loved her, and who feared God, and she was angry with the men who had killed the deacon. And she said unto him, ""O my beloved, those men killed a deacon who loved me, and [men] buried him outside the consecrated burial-ground, and this is a disgrace to me. And behold I tell you that that deacon repented during his lifetime with a sincere repentance. I command you to tell the deacons to go and bring him out of the place where he is and to bury him in consecrated ground among the believers."" When the deacon heard these words from our Lady Mary he rose up straightway, and assembled all the deacons and told them what he had seen. And they all went outside the city and opened the deacon's tomb and brought him out, and when they had done so they found a beautiful sweet-smelling flower.

Fol. 73a, 1.] THERE was a certain man who was an envoy of the king, and he was a Persian and belonged to the company of the horsemen, and his name was Nicodemus. Now, he sinned greatly, and his offences were innumerable, and he committed fornication with lewd women beyond measure, and he was evil in all his ways. But through the intercession of our holy Lady, Mary the twofold Virgin, the God-bearer, the mercy of God visited him, and she had compassion upon him and de livered his soul, and he repented of his sins and forsook all the evil of his works, and turned unto God with a ready heart; and he cast away the lust of the flesh, and became a monk in a certain monastery. And the good and gentle prior undertook to train him himself, and he wished to teach him the Psalms of David, so that he might use them as prayers at the season of prayer; but the monk was unable to learn. Then again he wished to teach him, ""Our Father, which art in heaven,"" but he was unable to master it. And it was only by means of great toil and labour that he learned to say, ""Salutation to our holy Lady, Mary the twofold Virgin, the God-bearer!"" Now he loved this prayer, and he recited it always and continually, both by day and by night, and in his sitting down and in his rising up, and in his coming in and in his going out, and he repeated it incessantly. And after he was dead and had departed from this fleeting world, a great miracle was made manifest at his grave. A splendid tree, which was most beautiful, and unto which no other tree could be compared, took root and grew up over his grave, and on the leaves thereof were written in letters of gold the words, ""Salutation unto thee, O my Lady Mary!"" And those who saw the miracle marvelled greatly at the beauty of the tree in every part of it, and they found that it was planted in the heart of the man, and that it had put forth its shoots through his tongue and through his mouth. Then they knew that he had lived with a pure heart and sincere mind whilst he prayed the prayer of ""Salutation"" unto our Lady Mary. And forthwith they all cried out together with a loud voice, and they glorified God, and gave praise unto our Lady Mary, the store house of compassion, and they multiplied their ministrations unto her and paid greater honour unto her than before.

But he loved our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, with a ready heart and a determined mind, and he used to keep the fast of Nahasse because of his love for her, and on the festival of her death he rejoiced exceedingly. And he was wont to make a feast for the poor and the needy, and the old and the young, both male and female. And one day certain men who hated him met him on the highway, and they stoned him, and beat him and wounded him with cudgels, until his body was a mass of bruised and bleeding flesh, but they were not able to drive his soul out of him; and although they attacked him fiercely with swords he did not die. Then Barok said unto them, ""Even if ye chop up my body into little pieces I shall not die, for my Lady Mary keepeth watch over me, and she protecteth me at all times, and will deliver me out of your hands""; and when they heard his words they all took to flight. Then Barok made his way to the priest, and received the Holy Mysteries, and at that moment the light of life rose upon him, and he died. And our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, received his soul and placed it in the Garden (i.e. Paradise) of joy, and those who had beaten him repented with tears and sorrow [and turned] to our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-bearer. As thou, O Mary, didst deliver from spears, for repentance and obedience, Barok, who was called the ""depraved man,"" and didst preserve him, Even so at all time in a state of safety Do thou preserve me, O Lady, so that I sin not, And even if I commit sin let thy mercy come to me.

And he loved our holy Lady, Mary the twofold Virgin, the God-bearer, from the depth of his heart, and he served her with all his might; and through his love for her he was wont to wear sack cloth on his body beneath his apparel. And it came to pass that when the sackcloth garment had become old and ragged, he wished to make another garment of sack cloth to wear in its stead, and he took a piece of new sackcloth, and went with it into his cave so that he might cut out the garment from it, and sew it together and put it on in secret, in order that no man might know anything about what he did. And when he had sat down in his cave he was puzzled how to make the garment, for he neither knew how to cut it out nor how to sew it up. And whilst he was troubling himself about this our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, appeared unto him and said unto him, ""Be not troubled. Thou hast made me to rejoice by thy good works, and thy toil and labour have been accepted by me; I will cut this sack cloth into a garment for thee."" Then she took the piece of sackcloth and cut out the garment therefrom, and she sewed it up for him and put it on him.

And he used to visit the church of our Lady, the Mother of mercy, and make pure first-fruit offerings unto her, and pay honour unto her with gifts and salutations, saying, ""Rejoice, O thou Virgin un dented, who hast given birth unto Emmanuel! Hail to thee, O thou who art full of grace, for thou hast given birth unto the Light that is before all others! Rejoice, O thou who hast given birth unto our Redeemer! Rejoice, O holy Virgin, who hast given birth to Christ and didst bring Him into the world without union with man! Therefore shall the nations bow down and adore thee, O thou who didst give birth to our Light. I beseech thee to be for me a mediator between me and thy Son."" And in this wise used he to pray in the church when the heavenly Offering was being made, and at the time of the Five Joys of Mary. And it came to pass after these things that the deacon fell sick and was nigh unto death, and the angel of death struck fear into his soul. Then our Lady Mary, the storehouse of mercy, the blessed Virgin, the joy of Christian folk, who sheweth favour unto kings, the mis tress of the angels, and the crown of the martyrs, appeared unto him, and said unto him, ""Why fearest thou with so great a fear? And why art thou dismayed? For when thou wast in good health thou didst greet me joy fully each and every day. And now, fear not, O my be loved, and let not thine heart be terrified, for no evil thing shall draw nigh unto thy body, and thou shalt not be terrified at the angel of death. As thou didst never cease [to praise me] with thy mouth, and didst greet me with joy, so likewise thou shalt find joy and be with me in the Garden (i.e. Paradise) for ever."" And when the deacon heard these words he found peace, and he thought that he would recover from his sickness. Then he awoke from his sleep and found his soul in great joy and gladness; and immediately he awoke he died, and his soul went forth from his body. And our pure Lady Mary received it in her hands, and it entered with her into the Garden of Joy, and into the place of delight and pleasure, where it would neither perish nor come to an end for ever. May the prayer of our Lady give our King David help, and make him to be girded about with power, and make him to be free from the opposition of the wicked and from the hosts of the enemy, and from the bow directed at him and from the sharp spear. O storehouse of mercy, take thou under the protection of thy prayer the soul of thy beloved one, for ever and ever. Amen.

And the monk to whom the dead monk was going knew that he wished to come to him, and through his spiritual excellence he mounted up upon a cloud, and flew along, and he met him on the Path of Souls, and through the might of God he seized Satan, and he said unto him, ""Whither art thou carrying this soul? "" And Satan said, "" He hath committed two sins. 1. Being a monk he lapsed from purity. 2. He hearkened to my voice and mutilated himself. Now the Apostles say: The Christian who letteth out blood except because of some disease, shall fast forty days."" This is what Satan said. And the monk said unto Satan, ""Thou didst disguise thyself to him and pretend to be I, and didst lead him astray."" And the Enemy said, ""I will not give him unto thee, but will carry him to Sheol."" And the monk said, ""I and thou will go to our Lady Mary that she may decide for us""; and forth with they went. And the monk said [unto her], "" O our Lady, this monk was coming to me to get comfort from me, and this Satan who made himself look like me found him, and advised him to mutilate himself. And it is about this that we are disputing."" The Enemy said, ""He hearkened to my words, and killed himself, and I am going to take him to Sheol."" And our Lady Mary said: ""I will judge rightly. The soul shall return to its body, but the mutilated part shall not be rejoined thereto."" And the monk worshipped our Lady. And the mutilated monk lived, and for the rest of his days he was like Anthony and Macarius, and was accept able to his Lord. And all those who heard this gave thanks unto God Who willeth the means of salvation, and worshipped our Lady Mary. Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933.

Fol. 38a.] THERE was a certain monk whose name was Gerdan, and when he was in the world he loved to go to Abba Jacob, and carry out for him all that he needed doing. And he rose up to go, and his wife went with him to set him on his journey, and animal desire overcame him, and he lay with her and then went on with his companions. And when he was far from his abode, a handsome Satan appeared unto him in the form of Abba Jacob, and said unto him, ""Thou dost not know me. After thou hast mutilated thyself thou mayest save thy soul, but if thou wilt not mutilate thyself God will never forgive thee all thy sin."" Now the man did not know the Satan, but having heard his words and imagining that he was Abba Jacob, he drew the hunting knife from his girdle and mutilated himself: he then plunged the knife into his neck (or, throat) and slit it open, and then fell to the ground drenched with his blood. And when his friends saw him drenched with blood they fled from him, being afraid lest people should say that they had killed him for the sake of his money. And after he was dead the hosts of Satan surrounded his soul. And as they were going along the road they came to a church of Peter, and they were rejoicing because of the soul which they had entrapped, and they met there Abba Jacob and Peter the Apostle, who said unto them, ""Why have ye acted thus and taken the soul of this man?"" And the devils described unto them all the man's deeds, and his sin, and how he had killed himself. And Abba Jacob said unto them, ""Ye corrupted him beforehand with fornication, and then ye appeared unto him in my form, and he committed this act of suicide because of my command. Now will I turn you back to my Lady, and she shall judge between me and you""; and they went to the Holy Virgin. And the angels and the righteous rejoiced, and the believing ones came, and they decreed that the man's soul should return to its body, and forthwith the man rose up alive without pain and without suffering, but the scar in his neck caused by the knife remained [visible]. Now the mutilated portions of his body were not restored. And he went to Abba Jacob and returned to the monastery, wherein he followed the ascetic life, and he lived with the saints in great humility until he died and entered into the kingdom of the heavens.

Fol. 9a.] THERE was a certain priest whose duty it was to recite the daily prayers of Mary the Virgin, and he knew no other Office. And the congregation complained about him to the Bishop, saying, ""This priest can only recite one Office, namely, that of Mary."" And the Bishop said unto him, ""Be patient until thou canst make thyself strong."" And this priest was sad and he wept because of his love for our Lady Mary, and he dwelt in the court of the Bishop. Now the Bishop was a God-fearing man, and a lover of prayer, and he kept vigil in sackcloth; and the sackcloth was underneath his apparel, so that men might not know that it was there. And the Bishop did not know either how to cut the sackcloth or to sew it, and he laid it out in front of him, and he wondered what he could possibly do with it. And he said, ""If I give it to [any] man he will know about my vigil, and my fast will be in vain""; and thus saying he wept. And because of this spiritual excellence of the Bishop our Lady Mary came to him, and took up the piece of sackcloth and cut it and sewed it for him, and she said unto him, ""Take it, it will be good for thee""; and straightway he worshipped her and she dis appeared from him. And then she went out and found that priest with a sorrowful heart and a bowed head, and she said unto him, ""What is thy sorrow?"" Now he did not know that she was our Lady, and he said unto her, ""Let me alone; I am in trouble."" And she said unto him, ""Tell me, so that I may give thee relief."" And he said unto her, ""Hearken unto me, O Lady, I know no other Office except that of the Virgin Mary. And the congregation have complained about me to the Bishop, and he saith, Thou must not minister. And because of this I am sad for the sake of my love for Mary."" And Mary said unto him, ""Go and say unto the Bishop: Set him free and give him leave to celebrate the Offering."" And the priest said unto her, ""He will not hearken unto me, and he will not accept my words."" And she said unto him, ""Say unto the priest: 'Set him free and let him minister'; thus saith unto thee the woman who cut thy sackcloth, and sewed up the ragged portions thereof."" And the priest came to the Bishop, and he bowed the knee and stood up before him, and he said unto him, ""A great lady, whom peradventure thou knowest, hath sent me,"" and he told him all that our Lady Mary had said unto him. And when the Bishop heard him, he rose up and kissed his head, and made him to sit down before him, and he said unto him, ""Thou shalt not recite any other Office except that of Mary. Thy lodging shall be here with me. Eat what I eat and drink what I drink. And as for these people who complained about thee they shall be put to shame.""

146,The knight who wanted to seduce the daughter of the cobbler.,,,LIT3867Miracle,"XLIII THE KNIGHT AND THE MAIDEN MARY [Brit. Mus. Orient. 652. Fol. 39b, No. 34.] AND there was a shoemaker who had a daughter whom God had given unto him, and she had spiritual excellences that were far superior to her beauty, and she was devoted to fasting and prayer. And she was pure from all sin, and transgression, and she loved our Lady Mary with all her heart and with all her mind; and her name was Mary. And one day, as she was sitting before the picture of our Lady Mary, she said, ""O my Lady Mary, my name is Mary, but it befitteth me not; it is suitable for thee only, for thou art pure from sin. And behold, I commit myself unto thee to keep me in thy mercy; and do thou remove from me all the power of the Enemy through thy love, O thou joy of the sorrowful and hope of the poor."" And when Satan, the enemy of the race of the children of men, knew of this he brought crafty tricks to attack her. And there was a certain horse-soldier, who was exceedingly rich, and his goods and possessions were very many, and as he was entering that city he met the maiden—now he was a lover of women—and as soon as he saw her his heart was smitten with love for her. And he sent unto her a certain woman who was pleasing in her person and of gracious disposition, one who corrupted the souls of men by her operations and by her voice, for the incantation of Satan was on her tongue. And she began to talk to that maiden about the destroying desires of the world, and to belaud fine and beautiful things, and how to catch the souls of men with a rope by means of magic. And when the maiden heard her words, she understood and knew well what she was seeking for and her intention, and she began to ill-treat her person and to curse her work. And the maiden drove her away from her, and the woman departed with her apparel dis arranged, and she repented that she had gone to her. And when she came to the horseman and reported to him concerning what the maiden had said unto her, his heart blazed with love for the maiden. And he said unto the woman, ""Old woman, advise me what I shall do."" And the daughter of Satan said unto him, ""I will counsel thee. Her father is a poor man and thou art a man of wealth. Summon him to thy house, and give him some of thy money, and let him bring the maiden."" And when the horseman heard this he sent for her father immediately. [And when he came] the horseman embraced him, and arrayed him in his own apparel, and gave him much gold and silver. And he said unto him, ""From this moment thou art my brother, and thou shalt be my friend, and whatsoever thou lackest I will give thee. And I demand nothing whatsoever from thee except one thing, which thou shalt do for me, and wilt find it beneficial for thyself, and thou wilt gain much money—that is to say, bring me thy daughter, and I will make her the richest woman in the city."" And when the father of the maiden heard the words of the horseman he rejoiced, and he rose up straightway and took the maiden against her will, and carried her to the horseman whilst she sorrowed and wept tears. And when she knew that there was no one who could help her she cried out to God and to our Lady Mary, saying, ""O my Lady, thou lover of men and hope of the poor, let thy power and thy majesty deliver me from this wicked man who is like unto Satan, the de stroyer of souls."" And when that man saw her excessive sorrow and weeping, he had pity on her tears, and he said unto her, ""Why weepest thou and why art thou thus sorrowful?"" And she said unto him, ""I have vowed myself and my virginity to my Lady, the Virgin Mary, the mother of mercy. And if thou dost trespass upon what is committed unto her she will take vengeance upon thee on the day of the Resurrection of the dead when thou shalt stand before her Son, the righteous Judge."" And when that man heard the name of our Lady Mary, God set in his heart a great fear, and his members shook like a reed in a strong wind. And he said unto her, with fear and in a gentle voice, ""Dost thou wish to become a nun?"" And she said unto him, ""Yea, I wish to serve the Lady Mary whom I love. I wish to serve her, and I long to see her."" And he said unto her, ""I will make thee a nun in a nunnery, and I will endow the nuns with great possessions."" And the nuns rejoiced, and he endowed them with great possessions and provided meat and drink for their sustenance, and he used to visit them in the love of God. And one day he went forth into the battle and died, and the Abbess and her daughters heard about it. Now the horseman had said unto them, ""If I die, bury me near you in your nunnery, because I have done good unto you."" And our Lady Mary appeared unto the Abbess and said unto her, ""Go thou with thy daughters, and bring in the body of the nobleman, and bury him near you."" And the Abbess said, ""We cannot, for we are afraid of the Fathers (Archbishops?) and Bishops."" And our Lady Mary said unto her, ""I will give thee a good sign that no one shall be able to oppose thee without being punished by me."" And the Abbess and all the nuns rose up and went to the body of the governor, and they found in his mouth a young branch, every leaf of which was fashioned in gold and had upon it an image of our Lady Mary. And they took the body of the governor, and wrapped it in costly apparel, and buried it with exceedingly great honour. And this took place through the love of our Lady Mary who loveth all those who trust in her, and who honoureth those who take asylum with her and rewardeth them in this wise, and even more abundantly, and maketh them to come into the path of righteousness.

Fol. 42a, No. 35.] THERE was a certain little boy in the city of Tiros (Tyre) who was a Jew, and he used to be taught with Christian children in a certain place. And when the festival of the Passover arrived the Christian children went to make offerings according to their custom, and the Jewish boy came with the Christian children and offered up with them. And as the priest was ad ministering the Offering to the people that Jewish boy saw a beautiful woman, who was arrayed in splendour and in glorious apparel, helping the priest at the altar. And when the Eucharist was ended, that boy came back to the house of his father; and his father said unto him, ""Why hast thou tarried so long?"" And the boy said unto him, ""I was in the church with the Christian children, and I offered with them."" And when the father heard this he was wroth with his son, and he turned towards the oven that was in his house, and that he had made red hot, and he seized his son and threw him into the oven, and shut the door of the furnace upon him. And when the boy's mother heard she cried out with a loud voice and wept. And many people, both Jews and Christians, gathered together, and they went to the furnace and opened it, and they found the boy alive and uninjured by the fire; and they called him and he went forth from the oven, and the fire had not hurt him, and had singed neither his clothing nor his hair; and they marvelled and were silent before this great miracle And they asked the boy and said unto him, ""What didst thou do?"" And he told them how he had received the Mystery, and how he had seen our glorious Lady Mary helping the priest at the moment of celebrating the Offering, and how that same Lady had caught him when his father cast him into the fire, .so that it did not touch him, and how she covered him over with her apparel. And when the Christians heard the voice of the boy they glorified God, the Most High, and our Lady Mary, the lover of mankind. And she seized that Jew, the father of the boy, and in his turn he was burned and became ashes; now the boy, and his mother, and all [the people of the house] became Christians. Budge, E. A.

148,The pregnant woman who was caught by the tide while going to the church of Saint Michael (Mont Saint Michel),Europe confirmed (France),,LIT3617Miracle,"XXXII THE VIRGIN MARY AND THE WOMAN WHO WAS ABOUT TO BRING FORTH [A. Fol. 70b, 1; B. Fol. 58a, 1 and 2.] NOW there was a certain city wherein a church had been built, and the church was built in the name of the Archangel Michael, and each year, on the twelfth day of the month Hadar, which is the day of the festival of the Archangel Michael, great numbers of the inhabitants of the city did not fail to visit his church—may his intercession and his supplication keep our King David from the evil enemy! And behold, it came to pass one day when the people were journeying along the road to come to that church, that a mighty roaring rush of waters came from the sea, and it burst upon the people and alarmed and terrified them exceedingly, and drove them out of their senses; and the water surrounded that place and rose to a height of about two measures, and the people were wellnigh drowned. Then each and every one of them made sup plication unto God, and every man sought out a means whereby he might save himself, and they took to flight and fled before the waves which rolled in from the sea, so that they might not be drowned by the waters, according to that which was wont to happen. And behold, there was a certain woman travelling with the company who was with child, and her time for bringing forth was nigh, and she was unable to run away with the other people. And she cried out after those who had forsaken her and fled, but no man turned back to have regard unto her, and she found none to help her, and despaired utterly of obtaining help from man. Then she cried out with tears unto God, the Most High, and unto our Lady Mary, the storehouse of compassion and mercy, who calleth every one unto the love of her beloved Son, the Redeemer of the world. And it came to pass that, when those who had taken to flight arrived at the seashore, she stretched out her hands, and raised her eyes to God in heaven, and made supplication unto our Lady Mary with great outcry and with much weeping and lamentation. And the waves of the sea stood there through the might of the billows thereof, and our Lady Mary brought tidings of hope and joy unto the woman, and covered her with her garments, and hid her from the sight of the sea. And the woman thought that she was in a well-built and well-furnished house. Then whilst she was in the midst of the sea, the pains of childbirth took hold upon her, and our Lady Mary took the child from her womb; and she gave birth to a fine boy. And his mother called her boy ""Abraskirospas"" [a name that means] in Greek and Hebrew "" The hand of Mary touched him and blessed him in the womb of his mother."" Now neither pain nor a flow of blood came to his mother [when she brought him forth]. And it came to pass that, when the sea returned into its own place, and the waters thereof became quiet, and the waves went down, the woman went forth from it carrying her child in her arms. And when the people saw her many of them marvelled and became speech less by reason of this great and miraculous thing, and they all ran after her and followed her, and when they had come up with her they asked her questions [about it]. And the woman related unto them the great and wonderful miracle which Mary, the Mother of Life, the vessel of prophecy, had wrought. And she told them how the Virgin had hidden her beneath the dark masses of the water so that she might not suffer death. And those who heard this story, men and women, children and aged folk, young men and babes, Jew and Gen tile, and all the people of the world, marvelled exceedingly, and they gave thanks unto the God of righteous ness, and they multiplied the praises of our Lady Mary, who worketh miracles innumerable, whose beauty is immeasurable, and whose rule is beneficent and ineffable. As thou didst cover over with thy garments the woman who was with child, and who was in the midst of The terrible waves of the sea, at the hour of her bringing forth and bearing a son, Even so cover thou me over, and let not my need be too hard for me, O my Lady Mary, who didst receive me into thy care from the womb, and cover thou me with vestments of light and not of skin.

And when the wife heard of it she sorrowed with a great sorrow, and she could find none to help her, and her sorrow increased. And she meditated in her heart and said, ""Since I have found no one to help me, behold, I must take asylum with her who is able to obtain whatsoever she wisheth from her Son, God, the Virgin Mary, the mother of mercy."" And she went daily to the church and prostrated herself before the altar of our Lady Mary, and she prayed there with a sad heart, and wept bitterly. And she said in her prayer, ""O my Lady Mary, the mother of mercy, I beseech thee to destroy for me this harlot woman who hath taken my husband from me amd left me [only] my grief; I beseech thee to avenge me on her. Let her fall sick, or die, or suffer tribulations, so that my husband may escape from her and return to me."" And all day long she prayed this prayer to our Lady Mary. And our Lady Mary appeared unto her by night, and said unto her, ""Woman, what is this petition wherewith thou petitionest me? And what is this prayer that thou makest to me? This prayer is wicked, for thou wishest me to kill my handmaiden. This woman boweth daily before my image, and she embraceth me, and maketh one hundred prostrations before me, and if I kill her for thy sake how can I be the mother of mercy? Nevertheless I do wish her to repent and to turn from her sin."" And the Virgin disappeared. And when the woman woke up from her dream, her sorrow was still acute, and she rose up in the morning and went to the church. And as she was going along the road she met the woman who had taken her hus band from her, and her wrath waxed furious against her, and she cursed her and said unto her, ""O thou harlot, thou knife-eyed woman, who art wholly without shame in thy face, thou hast taken away from me the husband who was my joy in my life and my protection in my death. Yet in spite of this thou servest my Lady Mary, and bowest down to her, and embracest her one hundred times every day, even as she told me during the past night. I will serve my Lady Mary, and I will minister unto her with a service that is twice as great as thine. And behold, thou shalt find punishment and tribulations because of the evil of thy actions. And if my Lady Mary will help me, I will petition my Lord Jesus Christ, her beloved Son, to avenge me on thee, and He shall punish thee in this world with suffering and sickness, and with fire in the world that is to come."" And when the woman heard the wife's voice she turned towards her, and threw herself down at her feet and said unto her, ""I swear unto thee that from this day I will never speak to thy husband, and that I will never embrace his body. And that thou mayest believe what I say I will go with thee to the church, and will take an oath to thee, so that from this day thy heart may no longer doubt."" And she went with her to the church and swore to her before the picture of our Lady Mary, and the people present were witnesses to her oath that she would never again associate with the man in the work of sin. And when the man heard what the woman had done, he repented of his sin and was sorry for what he had done, and he returned to his wife.

Fol. 66a, 1; B. Fol. 32a, 1 and 2.] NOW there was a certain poor widow who had one son, and besides him she had no other child. And every day she used to come to the church and stand up before the picture of our holy Lady, the two fold Virgin, and say, ""O my Lady, I commit this my son unto thy safe keeping, so that thou mayest guard him, for I have no other child besides him""; and in these words she used to pray daily. And it came to pass that, when her son had grown up and become a hale young man, he fell into the company of thieves, and became a robber. Now after a little time [the watch men] caught that young man and the other thieves who were with him, and brought them before the magistrate of the city, who passed a sentence of doom upon them; and [the guards"" crucified them according to the law of their city. And the mother of the young man did not know that all this had happened to her son, and as she was going in through the gates of the church, the neighbours told her, and said unto her, ""Knowest thou not that they have crucified thy son, together with the other thieves?"" And she said unto them, ""I did not know it""; and straightway she cried out with a loud cry, and she wept bitterly. And she went and stood up before the picture of our holy Lady, Mary, the two fold Virgin, the God-bearer, and she lifted up her eyes and said, ""Where is he whom I committed unto thy safe keeping? Where is the pledge which I deposited with thee, O my Lady? Behold, they have seized my son, together with the other thieves, and they have crucified him. So now, if thou wilt not deliver my son and save him, I will snatch thy Son out of thy bosom."" And at that same moment there was a great outcry, and many people came thronging into the church through the gates. Now when the widow heard the outcry, she turned round, and she saw her son coming in with the people, and she ran and embraced him. Then the people who were gathered together said unto him, ""What hath happened unto thee? And how wast thou saved?"" And the young man said unto them, ""When they had suspended me upon the wood, and were about to drive the nails into me, there came unto me a woman who was most beautiful in form, and who was shining with a light that was brighter than that of the sun, and she held back the nails so that they did not touch my flesh. Then she took me down from upon the wood, and said unto me, Get thee to the church, and to thy mother, for she wisheth to snatch my Son from my bosom in thy stead."" Then the people ascribed praise and glory unto God, the Glorious and Most High, and they gave thanks unto our holy Lady, Mary, the twofold Virgin, the God-bearer. And the woman and her son ministered in the church of our holy Lady until their death. Another version reads: It is said that there was a certain man who was a thief and a robber of churches, and that inasmuch as he was a man of evil habit and life he stole things from them daily; and all the people were lying in wait to catch him. And it came to pass one day that he carried off some of the possessions of our Lady Mary, according to his wont, and the people caught that thief, and beat him, and bound him in fetters and chains, and they planned to kill him. And he said, ""I place my trust in our holy Lady, the twofold Virgin, Mary, for whosoever believeth in her prayers shall be saved from all sorrow."" Then our holy Lady appeared in visible form to the men who had beaten him, and had laid hands upon him to kill him; and she said unto them, ""Release him."" And they released him by the command of our holy Lady, Mary the twofold Virgin, and set him free from his fetters, and all the people marvelled at her mercy. Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933.

And she had one son, and besides him she had no other child, either son or daughter; and she loved this son exceedingly, and with her very soul. Each day, without fail, she was wont to go to the church of our Lady Mary with her son, whose name was Philemon, and pray to her for him, that she would take his soul under her protection, and would keep him from all evil, and would deliver him from all the distress that is set in this world. And she used to pray continually in the church, and she never failed to go there, and to pray on behalf of her son and to make supplication with a ready heart. And it came to pass that when Philemon, the son of this poor old woman, was moved by hunger and want of clothes, and poverty came upon him and he found himself in want, he joined himself to a company of thieves and robbers. And one day when he was plundering the house of a certain rich man in Alexandria, together with the thieves who were his companions, the menservants of the house of the rich man heard the noise of their feet on the third floor above, and they raised the alarm. Then the people of the city came to their help, and they seized Philemon and the [other] thieves, and they brought an accusation against him, and then they hanged him upon a sycamore-fig tree; and he remained hanging there for three days and three nights without eating food or drinking water. Now at the end of three days they told his mother. And it came to pass that when she heard this she cried out with a loud voice, and she went to the church, and called upon the name of our Lady Mary, and said unto her, ""Behold, my son whom I committed to thy care hath been cast away, and he hath been destroyed for nought. Now therefore, give me back my son, and redeem thou him by the might of thy Son; if thou lovest my son thou canst deliver him, for thou hast the power to do whatsoever thou wishest. Thou art the Mother of the Word of God Who became man through thee, and He hath delivered us from our Enemy, Satan, and He will consent to do what thou sayest, and will grant thee thy command, for there is none who can resist thee. Of His own freewill and by the good pleasure of His Father, He came and took up His abode in thy womb, and whatsoever thou askest Him He will give unto thee, O thou who art the boast of the race of the children of men, O thou who art the Bridge of the sons of men, O thou who art full of grace, God, in Whom there is neither division nor diminution, is with thee, and through the might of Jesus Christ, thy beloved Son our Lord, thou hast the power and the strength to do. Now therefore, O my Lady, if thou wilt not cause my son Philemon to come back, and wilt not bring him to me here, where shall I be able to find him? And in that I have committed him to thy care I have destroyed mine own son in mine own lifetime. And behold, I will take thy Son out of thy bosom in the place of mine own son Philemon."" And having said these words she set out to go to the image of our Lady in order to carry out the determination that she had formed in her mind. And straightway, on that selfsame day, Mary took a strong pole in the form of a branch of a tree, on the top of which was [fastened] a strong, curved knife, and she cut off the branch of the sycamore-fig tree upon which the son of the widow was hanging, and she set him free from his fetters. Then straightway the young man rose up, and went and walked among the crowd of people and arrived speedily at the church. Now his mother heard the noise of the multitude of people as they were coming in through the door of the church, and when she turned and saw her son among the people who were crowding in to enter through the door of the church, she ran towards him, like a woman who had gone mad, by reason of her exceedingly great joy at the sight of her son. And she seized him with her hands, like a savage lioness, and she hugged his neck, and kissed his mouth, and said unto him, ""O my son, tell me where thou hast been. Behold, for three days and three nights I have been dying for a sight of thy face; oh, I beseech thee to tell me where thou hast been! Who hath given thee bread to eat? Who hath given thee water to drink? O my son, tell me."" Then her son cried out with a loud voice before all the people and said, ""Behold, I was hanging for three days and three nights from a sycamore fig tree, but our Lady Mary fed me with heavenly food, and gave me to drink of the water of life. More over, she brought me down from the fig tree and sent me away, and said unto me, ""Go unto thy mother in peace."" And when the people who were there, that is to say, men, and women, and children, and old men and young men, and children and old women, heard this, they glorified God and ascribed great praise unto Him. And they praised our Lady Mary exceedingly, and likewise gave thanks unto her, and they sang hymns and praises unto the Word of God, and they cried unto Him joyfully, and shouted with gladness in honour of our Lady Mary, because of the wonderful and miraculous thing that she had done. And it came to pass that when the Bishop, Abba Benyami, heard these praises and glorifyings of Mary, he summoned all the people and made them come unto him, and then he enquired concerning the youth and his mother, and concerning the miracle which our Lady Mary had made manifest that day. Then he took the youth and his mother, and established them in his own house, and because of the honour in which he held the holy Virgin Mary he provided them with their food and their apparel, until he died. O thou beautiful Mother of the King Who redeemed us, As thou didst aforetime deliver the widow's son who was a thief, So, O Mary the Virgin, mayest thou earnestly desire my deliverance! May mine enemy [be turned back] until he gnasheth with his teeth, And send thou against him a devil that shall torture him! Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933.

153,The young man who used to bring roses to the icon of Saint Mary.,,,LIT3596Miracle,"X THE VIRGIN MARY AND THE YOUTH ZECHARIAH [A. Fol. 20b, 1; B. Fol. 242a, 1.] NOW there was a certain youth in the city of Rome (Constantinople) who was of noble birth, and his name was Zechariah; and he was handsome in appearance. And it came to pass that on a certain day he went into a church to pray, and he saw there a picture of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, which pleased him exceedingly; and his heart burned as with fire by reason of the ardour of his love for her. And he meditated within himself and said, ""What gift that will be acceptable unto her can I offer unto her?"" And forth with he took fifty roses, and made them into the form of a crown, and he fastened them to the picture over the head [of the Virgin]. Now when the days of roses had come to an end, he was exceedingly sorry, because he lacked the wherewithal to make an offering to present unto her. Then he went into the church and stood up before the picture of our holy Lady, the Virgin two fold, Mary, and said unto her, ""O my beloved Lady, thou knowest that the days for roses are passed and gone. But I wish to present unto thee [something] each day, and I will therefore give unto thee fifty salutations instead of the fifty roses."" So each day he recited the words, ""Hail to thee, O my Lady, rejoice thou with joy, for God is with thee!"" And he continued to recite these salutations each day until he grew up, when he departed unto another city. And when he was journeying through a terrible wilderness—now thieves dwelt therein and used to lie in wait [for travellers] and he was afraid lest he might fall into their hands—he remembered that he had not re cited the salutation of the angel, and he went forth into the wilderness to pray. And it came to pass that the captain of the thieves saw him and followed him, so that he might see what Zechariah was about to do. And when Zechariah had come into the wilderness he turned his face towards the East, and he lifted up his eyes to heaven, and knelt down upon his knees on the ground. Now when he knelt down, the captain of the thieves* saw a lady come down from heaven with great glory, and there were beautiful virgins with her. And they set a seat for her, and she sat down in front of Zechariah; and every time he spake a rose came forth from his mouth. And our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, rose up and took him to her bosom until she had received fifty roses from him; now the captain of the thieves counted the roses and he saw them with his own eyes. And it came to pass that when Zechariah had finished his prayer, our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, laid her hand upon his head, and having blessed him she went up into heaven with the virgins. And the captain of the thieves marvelled at what he had seen, and turned away into the wilderness. Then Zechariah turned to continue his journey, and straightway the thieves rose up against him and seized him. And the captain of the thieves said unto him, ""Tell me how thou didst send away those beautiful women, and what thou hast done with them."" And Zechariah said unto him, ""I am a sinful man, but I know nothing whatsoever of any beautiful women. But I used to offer as a gift each day to our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-bearer, fifty salutations, saying, 'Rejoice, O thou who art full of grace, for God is with thee.' "" Then the captain of the thieves made known unto Zechariah everything [which he had seen], and he said, ""From this day I will turn to repentance, and I will serve the Lady of us all, the holy woman, the Virgin twofold, Mary, all the days of my life""; and thus also spoke all the thieves. And they sent Zechariah away on his journey, and he departed in peace. And afterwards the thieves repented and became monks, and they served our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, all the days of their life. The young man Zechariah instead of fifty roses Presented words of praise when he made an offering unto thee. As thou didst deliver him in olden time from slaughter by thieves in the wilderness, Even so deliver thou me, O my Lady, and save me from condemnation, When neither gold nor white pearls [can do so].

154,The two women who were attacked by robbers on their way to church.,,,LIT3597Miracle,"XI THE VIRGIN MARY AND THE WOMEN JULIANA AND BARBARA [A. Fol. 23a, 1 ; B. Fol. 50a.] NOW there were two handmaidens of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, who gave birth to God in Bethlehem of the children of Judah; the name of the one was Juliana, and the name of the other was Barbara. And one day, as they were going to Jerusalem to worship at the Festival of the Departure of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, they were attacked in the village of Rosmaduk by thieves who took away their food from them. And it came to pass that, when the thieves had divided the bread that they had taken away from them, they began to eat it among themselves. And as each one of them put a morsel of it into his mouth and began to eat, straightway their front teeth and their grinders became broken, and their mouths were filled with pieces of broken teeth, and the insides of their mouths and their throats were cut deeply by them ; and they could not speak and were nigh unto death. And those who saw and heard this miracle marvelled greatly and were astonished, and by reason of their terror and awe of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, fear and trembling entered into their hearts. Then the thieves went and repented, and they forsook their evil deeds, and they entreated forgiveness of their sins from our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, and they gave unto Juliana and Barbara each a double portion of goods in return for their food which they had carried off. And our Lady, the store house of mercy, spared them, and restored their teeth to the condition in which they were aforetime; for she is able to do all things, and there is nothing which she cannot do, and she is a worker of miracles and wonders. May her prayer, and her blessing, and the mercy of her beloved Son, be with our King David for ever and ever! Amen. Thy power, O Mary, hath broken the tooth of our sin. When the thieves ate together morsels of the bread of the two maidens Thy power made manifest a wonderful thing, And thou, O my Lady, didst perform a work un known [before].

Mus. Orient. MS. No. 652. Fol. 51a, No. 43.] THERE was a certain woman who dwelt in a church of our Lady Mary, and she loved her with all her strength and all her heart. And she was wont to bless the Virgin, saying, ""Blessed art thou, 0 Mary! How didst thou bring forth the One, thy Son, the Word of God, the joy of celestial and terrestrial beings? Blessed art thou who didst carry the Word of God in thine arms and in thy womb, and didst suckle Him at thy breasts, and didst carry Him upon thy shoulders! Blessed are thine eyes which saw Him, and blessed is he who saw her joy on that day!"" And whilst she. was thinking thus in her heart, a most beautiful Child appeared to her, and His face shone and He stretched out His hands to her. And the woman pushed the Child from her, for she was praying, and she thought that He was one of the children who were in the church with their parents. And when she drew her hand away from Him, the Boy opened His mouth and said unto her, ""Thou prayest and entreatest to see My day, and thou makest request to My Mother continually: I have come to thee and thou wilt neither receive Me nor lift Me up."" And when the good woman heard His speech she turned towards Him quickly and looked at His Face, and it was shining like the sun; and at that moment He disappeared from her. And that woman fell down and became like a dead body, and she was not able to speak to [any] man. And when her understanding returned to her, and she had risen up out of her dazed state (literally, drunkenness), she shed tears that were like unto coals of fire.

156,The young novice whom Saint Mary encouraged to persevere in his vocation.,,,LIT3924Miracle,"CVIII THE VIRGIN MARY AND THE VISION WHICH SHE SHOWED TO A YOUNG MAN [Brit. Mus. MS. Orient. No. 652. Fol. 52a.] AND there was a certain handsome young man who loved our Lady Mary with all his heart and with all his mind, and he went to a monastery so that he might take counsel with himself, and he remained [there] for a year. And when that period had passed, the Archimandrite said unto him, ""O my son, it is fit ting that thou shouldst do one of two things: Thou shouldst either take up thine abode in the monastery among the brethren, and ascribe blessing to thyself that thou wilt be able to serve Him all the days of thy life, or thou shouldst go forth [from us]."" And when the young man heard the Archimandrite's words, he went into the church, and lifted up his eyes to God—may He be praised!—and besought Him to give him good counsel, and counsel whereby the salvation of his soul would be brought about. And as he was standing in the church among the brethren, slumber seized him, and he saw as it were a garden planted in a desert place, wherein there were trees of every kind, and flowers, and fruits, and upon the trees were birds of every kind, each one singing his own particular note, and their warblings were such as to rejoice the heart of a man. And the forms and appearances of them led captive the sight, and their plumage glistened like the light and like the topaz. And the young man saw in that garden a palace whereof the walls were built, outside and inside, with precious stones; and it was inlaid with gold, and silver, and emerald stones, and it shone like the sun. And the odour of the perfume cured every disease and healed every sickness. And when he drew nigh unto that palace he heard coming forth from it a beautiful voice which charmed the hearts of men. And as he was thinking thus concerning it there came forth from that palace young men who were like unto shining stars, and they were arrayed in white apparel which was worked with gold and silver. And after them there came forth beautiful virgins, each one arrayed in her own special apparel and wearing precious gems; and after them went forth our Lady Mary shining more brightly than the sun and moon. And when they went forth into the garden they set for her a throne the like of which man had never seen, and our Lady Mary sat down upon it and looked round to the right and to the left. And she saw the young man and commanded [the virgins] to bring him to her; and when he came before her she said unto him, ""Who art thou?"" And he said unto her, ""I am a poor man."" And she said unto him, ""Dost thou wish to serve me?"" And he said unto her, ""I am a poor man, and thou art a great Lady, and thou canst have no plea sure in my becoming thy servant."" And she said unto him, ""I am well pleased that thou shouldst serve me""; and he bowed low before her and departed. And as he was going away he turned and looked behind him, and she commanded them to bring him back. And when he came back she said unto him, ""Why didst thou turn and look behind thee?"" And he said unto her, ""O my Lady, I wondered who thou wast and what was thy name."" And she said unto him, ""Dost thou not know me, seeing that I am with you and that the memorial of me is among you at all times? Hast thou not heard the name of Mary, the mother of Jesus Christ?"" And when he knew who she was he uttered a great cry at the top of his voice, and said, ""My Lady Mary!"" And when the brethren who were in the church heard him they made haste and came to him, and they thought that his mind was darkened. And the young man rose up straightway and went to the monastery, and bowed down at the feet of the Archimandrite, and told him about everything which he had seen, and asked him how to complete his adoption of the life of a monk. And the Archimandrite arrayed him in the garb of the monk and prayed over him. And he served our Lady Mary all the days of his life and departed into the kingdom of heaven. Budge, E. A.

Fol. 47b, 1.] NOW there was a certain Abbess of the Monastery of Mount Carmel whose name was Sophia; she was a God-fearing woman, and she was very beautiful in form, and she loved our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, with her whole heart. And she had under her charge in that monastery a large number of virgins and women who were vowed to the ascetic life, and she taught them the rules and ordinances of the life of nuns, and strictly admonished them continually not to speak words of lightness and not to be slothful in observing the seasons of prayer. And for these reasons they hated her, and they awaited eagerly the happening of some scandal in her time so that they might remove her from her position. And there was in the monastery a certain young man, who was a servant and who attended to the food and clothing of the virgins, and Satan being jealous of the Abbess cast into her heart the lust of the flesh, and she committed fornication with that serving man and became with child by him. And this thing became manifest to the nuns, and they knew that the Abbess had conceived; and they went and made an accusation against her to the Bishop, whose name was Abba Severus, and informed him that the Abbess had become with child. Now when the Bishop heard this he sent a messenger unto the Abbess saying that the virgins were to be gathered together on a certain day, and that he would come to inspect them. And when the Abbess heard the words of the messenger she was terrified, and she knew that the virgins had laid an accusation against her. Then she went quickly into the church and prostrated herself before the picture of our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, the God-bearer. And she wept with a bitter weeping and a burning heart, and she said, ""O thou who lovest mercy and compassion, make soft thy heart towards thy sinful handmaiden who hath been entrapped in a snare, and show lovingkindness unto her, and do away the wickedness which I bear in my womb, and put me not to open shame, O my Lady."" Now through the abundance of her weeping she became ex hausted and fell asleep, and she saw in her sleep our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, come to her, having two angels with her. And she said unto the Abbess, ""Be not thou sorrowful, for behold, I have made supplication to my Son to forgive thee thy sin, but thou must never commit the sin again."" Then our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, said unto the two angels, ""Take ye away the child that is in her womb, and give it unto the man whose name is Pilkes (Felix), so that he may take it under his protection and suckle it, for he possesseth much cattle."" And the angels did as our Lady com manded them. Then the Abbess awoke from her sleep, and felt her womb and found that the child was not there. And she gave thanks unto our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-bearer, with her whole heart because of the miracle which she had wrought for her, and she went forth to her work according to her wont. And it came to pass that at the appointed season the Bishop arrived, and he entered into the abode of the virgins, and the Abbess met him, having with her one of the nuns who had made the accusation against her. Then the Bishop asked the Abbess how it was that she had become with child by fornication, and she denied it, saying, ""I have not done this thing."" And the Bishop commanded the oldest of the women to examine the Abbess, and to find out whether she was with child or not; and when they had examined her they found no trace of conception in her womb, and they thought that she was a virgin who had never known man. Then they told the Bishop this thing, but he did not believe them, and thought that, having taken a bribe from the Abbess, they were concealing her transgression for her. And the Bishop rose up, and with him there were priests, and deacons, and women who were devoted to the ascetic life, and they examined the body of the Abbess, but they did not find a child therein. Then straightway the Bishop repented with a great repentance, because he had reproached the Abbess without just cause, and he turned to those virgins who had made the accusation against the Abbess, and was wroth with them because they had accused her of shameful conduct. Now when the Abbess saw that the Bishop was angry she was afraid lest those virgins would be expelled and sent away and led into captivity by Satan through her. And straightway she rose up and said unto all the company, ""Depart ye from the Bishop for a season""; and she told him all her transgressions, and openly confessed to him what she had done in secret. And besides this she told him how our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-bearer, had appeared unto her, and how the two angels had taken the child from her womb, and how they had given him to a certain man to be suckled and reared. Now when the Bishop heard these things from the Abbess he marvelled exceedingly, and he sent a message unto the man, whose name was Felix, and who had perceived the miracle, to come and bring the child with him; and Felix came and brought the child with him. And it came to pass that when he arrived the Bishop questioned him closely about the child, and Felix told him, saying, ""Two young men of most goodly appearance came unto me and said, Our Lady Mary saith unto thee: Take this child and keep him with thee, and suckle him and rear him; then they gave me the child, and disappeared from me, and behold, this is the child."" And when the Bishop heard him he marvelled greatly, and he took the child and kept him in his own house, and he provided him with everything that was required by a child of his age. And when the boy had grown up he taught him the Psalms of David, and read to him stories of the Saints; and the Holy Spirit came upon him in abundance, and the love of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, was with him in full measure. Now after the death of Abba Severus the Bishop, they appointed the young man Bishop in his stead, and seated him upon [his] throne; and he was a good shepherd all the days of his life, and he died in peace. Mary is the Sanctuary of the Law, and she is the Evangelist, and the abode Of the Paraclete Who visited her. Thou didst remove quickly from the womb of Sophia the child of her sin; By the sound of thy supplication let my sin be done away Even as the foam of the sea is swallowed up by the sand. Budge, E. A.

Fol. 20b.] AND there was a monastery in a certain town, wherein there was a God-fearing widow who cleaned the church, and she attended to the altar of our Lady Mary, and she saluted her, and worshipped her, and prayed unto her at all times from the depth of her heart. And Satan, the enemy of spiritual excellence and the virtues, was envious of her. Now there was a certain monk who used to come to the church wherein that woman was, and Satan caused the remembrance of sin to be pleasant to them, and they loved each other with a sinful love. And Satan worked upon them until at length the man said to the widow, ""I am dying through the excess of my love for thee."" And when the widow heard his words she said, ""As for me, I cannot sleep at all at night because of my great love for thee. Show me what thou wilt do so that we may meet in some place, and let us go away alone together into another town."" And they agreed together that he should come to her at midnight, and that they should go away to another town. And when the time that they agreed upon arrived, he came to her. And when the widow saw him she rose up quickly, and she took the key of the church and went to the picture of our Lady Mary, and said, ""My Lady, I cannot endure, it being too great for me, and I beseech thee to go with me""; and she laid the key on the altar. And she went away with the monk to another town, and they fell into sin for four years, and no child of theirs lived. And when they saw this thing they were sorrowful, and were troubled and angry by day and by night. And she said unto him, ""All this is through thy sin. Thou didst bring me out of my nunnery, and didst thyself abandon thy monastic life. Woe be unto thee before thy Creator as the author of my sin""; and the man spake unto her in similar words. And one day she said unto him, ""I wish to go back to my nunnery, and to repent of my sin,"" and they agreed together to go back, and so they returned to the town whence they had come. And the widow went to the district round about the nunnery and she asked the neighbours there, saying, ""What do people say about that woman who attends to the church?"" And they said unto her, ""They say that she is an excellent woman, virtuous and holy""; and when she heard this she knew that the matter was from our Lady. And she waited until midnight, the time she had come out, and then went into the church, and she found our Lady Mary standing in the church and the key with her; and the widow bowed down before her and she took the key from her hands. And our Lady Mary said unto her, ""Sin not again as thou hast sinned, and I will entreat my Son to forgive thee."" And the widow went to her chamber and found her apparel there, and she changed her garments and returned to her service. And when the dawn came she went about among her sisters in fear and trembling, seeing how great a sin she had committed, but she found none who reproached her or who uttered a word of offence to cause pain to her heart. And she rejoiced greatly, and she ministered to our Lady Mary. And afterwards she confessed her sin, and was consoled, for by purity a man obtaineth salvation; and when she died she went into the kingdom of heaven. And this miracle was known throughout the whole country, and those who heard of it did homage to the picture of our Lady Mary, the worker of wonders and miracles. Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933.

160,The bee keeper who consulted a sorceress to have more honey.,Europe confirmed,,LIT3923Miracle,"CVII THE VIRGIN MARY AND THE BEEKEEPER [Brit. Mus. MS. Orient. No. 652. Fol. 22a.] THERE was a certain man who possessed very many bees, and he wished to have a yield from them which was greater than that of any other beekeeper. And he went to a certain woman who was a sorceress, and he said unto her, ""I entreat thee to advise me and to tell me what I am to do so that I may have more honey and more wax by far than any other beekeeper."" And that sorceress said unto him, ""I will advise thee. When thou art receiving the Offering, expel it from thy mouth and put it into thy hive, and then thou shalt have abundant honey and wax."" And on the following day he rose up early, and went to the church, and received the Offering, and even as the woman told him he took it out of his mouth and put it among the bees. And he waited one hour and returned to the bees, and he saw in the beehive, at the place where he had laid the Offering, a great light. And there was a figure of our Lady Mary sitting in that beehive, and in her lap was a little Child who shone more brightly than the sun and was more beautiful than the moon. And when he saw this he was afraid with a great fear, and he went to the priest and told him all that he had done and seen; and the priest did not believe his words. And he sent a deacon and said unto him, ""Go with him and see what he will show thee."" And when the deacon went he saw what the man said he had seen, and he returned in fear and told the priest what he had seen. And when the priest was certain about the matter [he told] all the people, and he summoned them with joy and gladness. And when the priest arrived at the beehive, he saw the light and the Virgin and the Child in her lap. And he was exceedingly sorry. And he commanded the people to carry off the beehive and to set it upon the altar. And he took the figure and laid it upon the altar, and he began to recite the Office of the Eucharist, and at the moment when he broke the Offering, suddenly the image came down to the Offering, and the priest took the Holy Offering, and finished the consecration of the Offering with great reverence. And this miracle became known throughout the country, and those who saw and heard praised God the Most High and gave thanks to our Lady Mary. Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933.

161,The pious monk (or: the Jew from Akhmim) whom Saint Mary made young.,,,LIT3589Miracle,"III THE VIRGIN MARY AND THE JEW OF AKHMIM [A. Fol. 8a, 1; B. Fol. 13b, 1.] NOW there was a certain Hebrew in the city of Akhmim who loved our holy Lady, the Godbearer, from the depth of his heart, and the mention of her name, with fear and trembling, was never absent from his tongue; and when he bowed down before her he was wont to embrace the ground in honour of her name. And the man was a priest, and he ministered holily in the church at the time of [burning] incense and presenting the offering (i.e. Eucharist). And it came to pass that when the days of his youth had passed, his strength failed and he was unable to stand up. And when the Archbishop knew that he had become feeble and was not able to stand up, he appointed two deacons to minister with him and to give him assistance. Now one day whilst he was singing praises to the name of our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, the God-bearer, and was bowing down to her to the ground, he fell for ward upon his breast, and his backbone was broken. And he cried out with a loud voice, and said, ""O my Lady Mary, come thou and help me in my fall."" Then straightway our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, appeared unto him standing on the right side of the altar, and she stretched out her hand over him, and touched his backbone which was broken, and made it whole. And she made a sign to him to come and stand on the right-hand side of the altar where she was. And immediately he perceived this he rejoiced greatly, and he marvelled and was astonished at the beauty of her form, and at the splendour which was round about her; and his old age was renewed, and he became a vigorous young man [again]. And he continued to minister in the church unto our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, all his days; and she added unto the years of his life one hundred and thirty years; and all his days were two hundred and thirty years, and then he died in peace and departed unto everlasting life. The blessed Hebrew in the land of Akhmim who had grown old, Whilst praising thy name and bowing to thee fell down. As thou didst appear unto him of old, and didst speak unto him the thing that was right, Even so, O Mary, appear thou unto me when I have taken to my bed; For upon this thing is my mind set with great anxiety.

162,The pious monk scribe who used to write Saint Mary's name in golden ink.,,,LIT3590Miracle,"IV THE VIRGIN MARY AND THE SCRIBE DAMIANUS [A. Fol. 9b, 1; B. Fol. 15a, 1.] NOW there was a certain monk called Damianus who dwelt in the city of Philippi, and he loved our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, from the depth of his heart, and he served her with all his power and strength, and he kept vigil in her church by day and by night. And that monk was a scribe, and it came to pass that, as he was copying the manuscripts [of her History], every time he had to make mention [of the name] of the Lady Mary he magnified her and paid honour unto her. Now he did not write her name with common water of lampblack (i.e. black ink), but he wrote it with ink made of gold and silver, and with rose-coloured paint, and with divers splendid colours that were like unto them in beauty and in value. And when that scribe fell ill, and was nigh unto death, before his soul departed from his body our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, appeared unto him, and said unto him: ""O my faithful servant, art not thou he who instead of writing my name in common black ink hath done so with ink of gold and silver, and hath painted it with divers splendid colours that are like unto them in beauty and value, and hath decorated it and made it glorious with the best of thine ability? Come now with me, that thou mayest see thy name inscribed with ornamental letters upon a pillar of gold in the kingdom of heaven. Fear not death to this transitory world, for behold, I will give thee everlasting life, and the joy that never cometh to an end."" And it came to pass that when she had spoken these words unto him his soul went forth from his body without pain and without suffering; and this miracle became known in all the country. May her prayer and the mercy of her beloved Son be with our King David for ever and ever! Amen. For Damianus who served thee as on a high mountain with deep devotion Thou didst write his name upon the pillar of red gold. O shining East, O Mary, O thou Morning, Write thou my name upon thy holy garments And upon the apparel of thy Son which is sprinkled with blood. Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933.

Later, as Bishop of Rome, he cut off his hand because of a carnal thought.",,,"LIT5903MMAbbasShort (short version), LIT5904MMAbbasLong (long version), LIT3591Miracle (general ID, applies to cases where the version cannot be identified)","[2 versions, very diff incipit] V THE VIRGIN MARY AND ABBAS, BISHOP OF ROME [A. Fol. 11a, 1; B. Fol. 16b, 1] NOW there was a certain Bishop of Rome who was called Abbas. He was a good and holy man, and he feared God Almighty and kept himself from unchastity and from meditation upon evil. And it came to pass that, one day during the festival [of the Virgin], when he was saying the prayer of consecration so that he might administer the Holy Mysteries to the people —now the people, both men and women, were in the habit at the time when they were about to receive the Holy Mysteries, before they prostrated themselves, of embracing the hands and the feet of the priest who was going to minister unto them—he smelt the odour of a certain woman as she was embracing his hands, and the unclean desire of the flesh entered into his heart, and he burned with the flame of lust. And after he had ended the Offering, he departed and went quickly into the chamber where the treasures belonging to the church were kept, and he took a knife and cut off his hand, and he began to weep. And it came to pass that while he tarried there the people in the sanctuary became very sad, and the priests and deacons went to him and said unto him: ""O master and governor of the people, we have waited long [for thee], and we are greatly distressed at thy tarrying""; and when they spake these words to him he wept the more. Then he rose up and went with them, and when he came before the picture of the holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, he fell down on his face before it, and he worshipped her and made supplication unto her, and entreated her to have mercy upon him, and to help him, and to pardon his sin. Then straightway our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, appeared unto him, and she took his hand [which he had cut off] in her holy hands, and rejoined it to the place from which it had been cut off, and it became whole even as it was aforetime, and no mark whatsoever of the cut could be found; then she disappeared from him. And when the priests and deacons saw this they marvelled and were silent. And they related this miracle to the people, and ascribed praise unto the glorious and Most High God, and gave thanks unto our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, who is able to perform all things, and who worketh miracles and doeth wonders. Now Abbas, a priest of Rome, Took a knife and cut off his hand, which caused him pain. As thou, O Mary, the sister of Salome, didst heal him of old, Even so do thou now heal the wound in my soul, and grant me rest Whensoever I invoke thy name, which giveth protection. Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933. One Hundred and Ten Miracles of Our Lady Mary, pp. 14-16. London: Oxford University Press, H. Milford. Va THE VIRGIN MARY AND LEO, BISHOP OF ROME [Brit. Mus. MS. Orient. No. 652, Fol. 82a.] THERE was a certain young man in the city of Rome who was a Muslim, and he was a survivor from the days of Islam [in that city]. And he used to go into a church, and stand before a picture of our Lady Mary, and salute her with salutations. And one day she spake unto him from out of her picture, and she said unto him, ""Why dost thou act thus, and come every day and pay me homage, not being one of the men of the Christian Faith?"" And he said unto her, ""I know that thou art the mother of God, and that thou canst deliver me from Sheol."" And she said unto him, ""Go thou to Father Leo, and he will help thee, and thou shalt be glad""; and he went to Father Leo. And Father Leo went out and he found the young man, and he said unto him, ""What dost thou want?"" And the young man said unto him, ""I wish thee to bring me back to the Christian Faith."" And Abba Leo baptized him, and called him by his own name, and he took him with him, and treated him as one of his children. And he handed him over to a teacher, and made him a deacon, and afterwards he made him a priest. When Abba Leo died, the people elected him to be their Abba in the room of Leo, for he was good and holy. And after he had been appointed Abba, one day he put on the Eucharistic vestments, and celebrated the Eucharist, and the congregation came and embraced his hands and his feet. And a few days later, a friend, a young woman, wished to go to him so that he might do her good, and she came to him with the [other] people, and she embraced his hand, and kissed it, and he was exceedingly angry. And having finished the celebration of the Eucharist, he went up on his couch and said, ""This hand of mine is defiled."" And he took a knife and cut it off, and he wrapped it in a cloth and set it down under his bed and went to sleep. And when the morning came, the people came to him and said, ""Come forth and officiate, for it is customary for a new Abba after his appointment to officiate for eight days without cessation""; and he said unto them, ""I cannot officiate to-day."" And they went away from him in anger saying each to the other, ""He is a pagan (Aramawi) and doth not wish to be Abba or to officiate."" And they went to him again on the third day, and said unto him, ""Officiate."" And he said unto them, ""I cannot."" And they said unto him, ""If thou wilt not officiate to-morrow they will set thee aside, and appoint another Abba in thy stead."" And he said unto them, ""Let them do as they please; I am well pleased that they should do this."" And at eventide he went down to the church, and stood up in front of the picture which had spoken unto him, and he said unto it, ""O my compassionate Lady, who didst show thy mercy and compassion unto me being unworthy of this gift, thou knowest how I have cut off my hand."" And the picture said unto him, Thou art a man without understanding and hast cut off thy hand. Knowest thou not that repentance cleanseth from sin? From to-day thou must never do such a thing again. Take this new hand which God hath given thee. And she fastened upon him a hand which was bright like the sun, and which sent forth light into all the place, and he rejoiced and was glad. And he gave thanks unto our Lady Mary who had shown favour unto him from first to last, and he went up into his bed and slept until daybreak. And at daybreak he went down to the church, and arrayed himself in the Eucharistic vestments, and when he raised his hand, there shot forth from it a light like that of the sun. And all those who looked at it were frightened, and all those who were in the church marvelled at this thing. And when he had finished the Office he went up upon his couch. And the bishops said unto him, ""Tell us what is this thing which we saw from thy hand to-day."" And he said unto them, ""Verily I tell you that my Lady Mary, the merciful one, gave me this hand. It is not a hand made of the earth""; and then he took up the hand which he had cut off [from under his bed] and showed it to them. And they marvelled at this thing and glorified God and gave thanks to our Lady Mary, who showeth acts of grace to those who serve her, and helpeth them in the time of their tribulation. Budge, E. A.

166,"The prudent monk who suspected that the food that the monks were eating was harmful, but then saw Saint Mary making it tasty for them.",,,LIT3914Miracle,"XCVIII THE VIRGIN MARY AND THE MONK WHO DESPISED THE COARSE FOOD OF THE BRETHREN [Brit. Mus. MS. Orient. No. 652. Fol. 27a.] THERE was a certain wise monk in a monastery, and he pondered in his mind about the green herbs which the monks ate, and he thought that they would die through suffering from divers pains. And one day whilst they were sitting together at the table, men brought in the food which was not to be eaten that day, and the monks ate thereof. And when that monk saw them eating he said within himself, ""None of these men will live a year."" And as he was thinking thus, behold, suddenly he saw the Virgin among the monks, and her face was shining brighter than the sun in the heavens and the stars. And with her were the virgins who ministered unto her, and they had with them a vase wherein was a health-giving substance the like of which no eye had ever seen, and of the sweetness of the perfume of which no ear had ever heard. And that Virgin began to take it out of the vase with a spoon, and she placed one spoonful in the mouth of each of the monks, beginning at the lower end of the table and proceeding to the higher. And when she came to that wise man and he opened his mouth to receive a spoonful like his brethren, she prevented him and would not give him any, and she said, ""His wisdom shall be profitable for this man, but for the poor [this] health-giving substance is their father."" And when the wise man heard this word he knew at once that the Virgin was our Lady Mary, and he was wroth with himself and was sorry for what he had done, and henceforward he ate with a pure heart what they brought to him. And when the monks saw this they marvelled, and asked him questions about it and he told them what he had seen and heard. And they praised God and gave thanks unto our Lady Mary, who neglecteth not her servants and protecteth those who trust in her. Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933.

And one day she opened her box and found it full of gold. And since she knew and was very sure that neither this gold nor anything else could be hers in the world to come, and that our Lady Mary had given it to her instead of the reward for her vow, she was sad and wept very bitterly. And when her husband saw that she was sorrowful, he was very sorry for her in his heart, and he asked her about the matter of her sadness. And she said unto him, ""I am very sad because thou hast made me give up fasting to our Lady Mary."" And he said unto her, ""Fast as thou pleasest""; and the woman fasted instead of eating. And afterwards she went to her box and opened it, and she found no gold whatsoever therein. And she knew that our Lady Mary was well pleased with her, and that she had laid up for her [treasure] where there is no decay, and she rejoiced with a great joy. And she told her husband all that she had seen, and he repented of what he had done, and fasted also, and he served our Lady Mary with all his might, and obtained life through fasting. Budge, E. A.

Mus. MS. Orient. No. 652. Fol. 28b.] THERE was a certain noble lady who lived upon an island in the sea (or, river), and she was one of the great ones of the town, and her kinsfolk were of high degree; and she had a husband who was also one of the great ones of the town. And that noble lady went to make her confession to the priest, and when the priest saw her arrayed in purple and wearing ornaments of gold and silver, and jewels of great price, he said unto her, ""O my daughter, thou must know that rich apparel induceth pride which destroyeth the soul. I will tell thee that which shall be profitable for thy soul, and that is, Give alms to the poor, and the needy, and the helpless, and the churches, and there shall be treasure for thee in heaven."" And when that woman heard the voice of the priest, she went and did as he had com manded her, and she gave her jewels to the poor and her apparel to the church. Now she loved our Lady Mary with all her heart. And when her husband saw what she had done he was sorrowful and would not speak to her. And when the festival of our Lady Mary arrived, that which was in commemoration of her entrance into the Sanctuary, she said unto her husband, ""I wish to go to the church."" And when he heard her words he chided her and said unto her, ""What will it profit thee to go to church among all the great people of the town? They are adorned with apparel of purple, and with gold and silver ornaments, and with raiment of fine linen, whilst thou, poor miserable creature, hast neither gold nor silver [brocade], having wasted thy money in alms. Every one who seeth thee in thy miser able rags will curse me."" And he swore by God, saying, ""Thou shalt not leave thy house and go to the church."" And when she heard the words of her husband she was sad, and she said, ""How can [I let] pass this great and glorious festival, which is blessed because God hearkeneth to the prayer which is prayed with Christian people?"" And she wept scalding tears with sorrow of heart, and lifted up her eyes to our Lady Mary, and she sorrowed because of the passing of the festival of the Virgin. And through the greatness of her sorrow, and weeping, and sadness because she had not gone to the church she fell into a short sleep. And she beheld as it were a multitude of Christians, both men and women, coming down from heaven into the church, and behold, the priest wearing his holy and august vestments began to recite the prayers from the beginning to the end. And the priest was giving a wax candle to every one, but he did not give a candle to that woman. And when the priest saw that he had not given her a candle he told the deacon to give her one like everyone else; and the woman took the candle and rejoiced greatly. And when the consecration of the Eucharist came, the people embraced the hands of the priest and gave him the candles according to custom. And the woman wished to embrace the hands of the priest, for the light of his face was revealed, but she did not wish to give him the candle in her hand; and she approached the priest and embraced his hand. And the deacon wanted to take the candle out of her hand, but she held fast to it and would not let it go; and the deacon laid hold upon it, and strengthened his grip and the candle came in two pieces. And when the Office was ended, the priest pronounced the benediction and the congregation dispersed. And the woman awoke from her sleep, and she saw the wax candle in her hand, and she knew that the dream which she had seen was a thing which was real. And she told all the people what she had seen and showed [them] the candle; now the wax was as white as snow and the odour of its perfume was beautiful. And this matter was heard of throughout the city, and the woman used to invite the people to give thanks unto our Lady Mary, the intercessor.

169,The rich merchant from Constantinople who lost all his money and made the icon of Saint Mary his guarantor when he borrowed money from a usurer.,,,LIT3870Miracle,"XLVII THE VIRGIN MARY BECOMES SECURITY FOR THE DEBT INCURRED BY A CERTAIN MERCHANT [Brit. Mus. MS. Orient. No. 652. Fol. 54a, No. 45.] THERE was in the city of Kuestentenya (Constantinople) a certain merchant who was very rich, and he had among the notables of the city a friend who loved him and embraced him. And one day the merchant said unto his friend, ""O my friend, I hold myself willing to help thee shouldst thou wish it""; and after three days he made him a feast according to his good pleasure. And after many days the horseman lost all his money, and he lacked the daily bread, for he had no other occupation and he knew no trade except horse manship. And he loved our Lady Mary with a right mind, and he trusted himself to her implicitly in his every matter, and in the time of his tribulation he placed his hope upon her. And by reason of his terrible plight he and the people of his house drew nigh unto death. And he went to a certain usurer, a Jew, and he asked him to give him money on usury. And the Jew said, ""I will give thee what thou wishest; give me a pledge."" And the knight said, ""I have none."" And the Jew said, ""Give me a security""; and the knight said, ""I will."" And he took the Jew to the church, and standing up before the image of our Lady Mary, he said unto him, ""This Lady and her Son will be security for me that I will repay thee thy gold by the day of her festival."" And the Jew, laughing at him, said, ""Behold, thou must give me a security upon whom I can rely for my money."" And he said unto the Jew, ""I will give thee my son. Take him, and if I do not pay thee back by the day of the festival of our Lady Mary, my son shall belong to thee."" And the Jew gave the knight what he wanted, and he departed on a journey, and he bought goods therewith; and he took pas sage in a ship and came to the city of Acco. And God brought him thither in peace and safety, and he sold everything that he had with him, and he made a very large profit thereon, gaining twelve dinars on every dinar. And he withdrew and set aside by itself the money that was owing to the Jew, and with the rest he trafficked, and then took a passage in a ship. And he asked the captain of the ship and said unto him, ""When will the festival of our Lady Mary take place?"" And the captain said unto him, ""Three days from to-day."" And again he asked the captain and said unto him, ""In how many days shall we reach port?"" And the captain said, ""Thou wilt arrive in thy city in ten days""; and the knight was exceedingly sad. Then he rose up forthwith, and took a box, and laid inside it the money belonging to that Jew, and he wrote on a piece of paper, which he placed inside the box, saying, ""This is the money [owing] to the Jew for which Mary the Virgin became security on behalf of the knight."" And he fastened up the box and cast it into the sea with confidence, and said, ""O my Lady Mary, I commit to thy care this money for which thou didst become security for me""; and the box arrived that night in the city of Constantinople. And when the morning had come, that Jew went out with his friends to walk about by the sea, and they saw that box, and his friends went down to the sea to take it up, but were unable to do so, for when they came near it to take it, the box withdrew seawards, and they were afraid [to follow it], and they came back. And the Jew himself, the owner of the money, stripped off his apparel and went down into the sea, and the box came towards him, and he took up the box, and came out of the sea, and opened it, and he found therein the gold and a paper whereon was written the name of the Jew. And he marvelled at this thing, and he took a little of the gold and gave it to his friends, and he said unto them, ""Make no mention of this matter""; and he took his money and hid it. And after ten days the horseman came to his city, and went into his house, but he neither went to the Jew nor spoke to him. And the Jew was wroth, and he took the son of the horseman and went to the governor, and the horseman made an accusation against him. And the governor called the Jew, and the Jew said unto the governor, ""My lord, I have a debt against him, and I hold his son in pledge, for he said to me, If the appointed time [for repayment] pass, and the money is unpaid, take my son."" And the horseman said, ""His money came to him even as we agreed together, and I have a witness concerning it."" And he took him to the church and brought him to the picture of our Lady Mary and said unto her, ""O my arbitress, thou knowest that thou didst become security for me with thy Son, and that I have paid the money; and thou art my witness [to the fact].""

170,Saint Mary saves from a lion a pious monk who had drunk too much wine.,Europe confirmed,,LIT3652Miracle,"[2 versions] XXXVII THE VIRGIN MARY AND TIMOTHY THE DRUNKEN MONK [B. Fol. 72a.] NOW there was a certain monk whose name was Timothy, and he was a steward of the church, and he loved our holy Lady, Mary the twofold Virgin, the God-bearer. And it fell out on a day that he drank some sweet wine, and he fell asleep and was unable to rise up at midnight for prayer. And when he awoke from his sleep in the morning he rose up to go to the church, and as he was on his way thither there came against him a lion, which roared at the monk and wished to tear him in pieces. Then straightway there came a lady who was shining with exceedingly great splendour, and she rebuked the lion and drove him away from the monk, who then went on his way to the church, marvelling at the lady who had delivered him from the lion. And when he had finished his prayer, he went to his work until the evening; and when the darkness fell he wished to go to the place where his bed was, and rest. Then straightway a mad dog rose up against him by the door of his house, and sprang upon him intending to bite him; and once again the shining lady came, and she drove away the dog. Then she led the monk into his sleeping room, and laid him upon his bed, and placed his pillow under his head; and she covered him over with his blanket, and made the sign of the Cross over him. Then the monk said unto her, ""O my Lady, I beseech thee to tell me who thou art."" And she said unto him, ""I am Mary, the Mother of Christ."" And when he heard her words he wished to bow down before her, and to embrace her feet, but she straightway disappeared from him. And he rose up in the morning and meditated in his heart concerning what he had seen, and he knew that the lion and the dog were of the deceitful phantoms of Satan, and he became certain that it was our holy Lady, the compassionate one, who extendeth help unto those who serve her, who had de livered him. Then he repented that he had been drunken with wine, and he never again turned to strong drink. And he yoked himself unto God, and performed his ministrations in the church of our holy Lady, Mary the twofold Virgin, the God-bearer. Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933.

And when he awoke from his drunken sleep he rose up to go to the church, and as he was going along the road a lion sprang up at him and wanted to kill him, and he saw a woman who shone with great brightness, and she drove the lion away from him. And when he wished to sleep a dog sprang upon him, and wanted to bite him, and that woman drove him away from him also. And she said unto him, ""Go thou to Brother So-and-so, and haste thee and do whatsoever he telleth thee""; and she signed him with the sign of the glorious Cross.

171,The husband who broke his vow that he would live celibately with his wife.,,,LIT3871Miracle,"XLIX THE VIRGIN MARY DELIVERS A YOUNG MAN FROM SHEOL [Brit. Mus. Orient. MS. No. 652. Fol. 56b, No. 47.] THERE was a certain honourable and blessed man who had a wife who was honourable and holy. And after they were married they made a covenant together that they would dwell together in a state of purity for the rest of the days of their lives. And after many days, when he was sleeping on a certain Friday morning, the lust of the flesh attacked him; but the woman did not wish to approach him, and she said unto him, ""Art thou not afraid of God? And wilt thou not keep the covenant that is between us? Moreover, this is the night of the eve of the Sabbath."" But the man did not turn away at her words. And when the woman knew that he would not let her alone, she said unto him, ""Whomsoever thou shalt beget this night shall belong to Satan""; and at that moment she conceived by him. And when the days of her conception were ended, she brought forth a man child of exceedingly great beauty and fine form. And when he grew up and had reached the age of twelve years, Satan appeared unto his mother, and said unto her, ""Remember thou this day, and mark well that three years hence thou shalt give unto me him whom thou didst vow unto me."" And whensoever the woman looked at her son she was stricken with sorrow, and she wept bitterly; and the youth marvelled and asked his mother [why], but she neither revealed the matter to him nor talked to him about it. And when her sorrow increased her son forced her to tell him the cause of it, and she told him all that had happened, and how Satan had appeared unto her, and what he had said unto her. And when her son heard his mother's words he was afraid, but he placed his trust upon the glorious God and hoped for His mercy, and he took asylum with our Lady Mary, the mediatress, and sought for help from her. And he departed to the city of Rome, and he took counsel with the Papa, who wrote a letter for him and sent him to the Bishop of Jerusalem; and he went to Jerusalem and told the Bishop all his affair. And the Bishop wrote a letter and sent it to a certain solitary monk (or, anchorite) unto whom the angels ministered and brought his food from heaven. And when the youth came to that anchorite, before he could declare his business the monk knew it. And he said unto him, ""Fear thou not, O my son. There is no hope for us except in taking asylum with our Lady Mary, the arbitrix and intercessor, and she will help us."" And the anchorite made the youth to stand between him and the altar, at the time of consecrating [the Mysteries], for he was afraid for him. When, however, the day of the appointed time came for Satan to take the youth away, he caught him as he stood by the altar at the moment when the monk was celebrating the Divine Mysteries, and took him down into Sheol and to the punishment that appertaineth thereto. And when the youth saw this he cried out in his great fright and called upon the name of our Lady Mary, the merciful one and intercessor, the hope of sinners and the glory of believers; and she delivered him quickly from Sheol, and restored him to the anchorite. And when the anchorite said, ""Peace be to all of you, ""the youth replied, ""with thy spirit""; and when the anchorite had finished the consecration the youth told him what he had seen. And the anchorite rejoiced and praised God, and gave thanks unto our Lady Mary. And thereupon the anchorite rose up and pronounced a blessing over his head, and committed him to the care of our Lady Mary, and he said unto him, ""My son, I commit thee to the care of her who delivereth those who commit themselves to her."" And he sent him to his parents, so that they might see him and rejoice. And the young man used to declare the excellence of our Lady Mary at all times. Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933.

172,The merchant who distributed as alms the money that had been loaned him by a friend.,,,LIT3872Miracle,"L THE VIRGIN MARY AND THE MERCHANT WHO BEGGARED HIMSELF FPR HER SAKE [Brit. Mus. MS. Orient. No. 652. Fol. 58b, No. 48.] THERE was a certain rich merchant who loved to give alms abundantly, and one day he pondered in his mind and said within himself, ""I have much goods and possessions, and if they give alms after my death on my behalf what will it benefit me? It will be far better for me to give them away during my lifetime so that God may receive me."" And he began to give away his goods to the poor, and the needy, and the orphans, and he did so until they came to an end, and he had nothing at all left. And as he was going about through the city he met a merchant who was a friend of his and who said unto him, ""What hath happened to thee? And what hast thou found? If thou hast come to poverty grieve not, for I myself will give thee ten thousand dinars wherewith thou canst traffick."" And the merchant said unto him, ""If thou wilt give me money thou shalt have interest on it""; and he gave him the money to traffick therewith, and to get back his money, and the profit thereon was to belong to the borrower, and the lender was to take what he had lent. And the borrower began to scatter the money among the poor according to his wont, and when the lender met him he enquired of him concerning it. And one day the owner of the money went to the borrower's house to see his goods which he had bought for him, and he found a crowd of beggars before his door. And he said unto them, ""What do ye here?"" And they said unto him, ""We are waiting for the merchant to come out."" And when the owner of the money heard these words, he smote his face and said, ""Thou hast wasted thy money on a madman""; and he went forth to seek the borrower in the city. And when he found him he seized him, and buffeted him, and reviled him, and said unto him, ""O perverse one, thou hast wasted my money! Take me back quickly and show me what thou hast bought."" And the borrower bore with the rich man patiently, and he said unto him, ""I have not wasted thy money. Come, that I may show thee what I have bought, and thou canst know thy profit, and every thing that I have bought will please thee."" And at that moment he thrust out the people that he might show the rich man his money, together with the profit thereon. And the rich merchant departed to his abode, and the blessed man (i.e. the borrower) went into his abode. And when the merchant was asleep he saw in a dream that the day of recompense had arrived, and that the Judgement was prepared. And the angels and the devils stood up afar off, and they brought men to be judged, and some of them did the devils carry. And behold, they brought the merchant to be judged, and the devils seized him and said, ""He is ours""; and the angels withdrew from him and the devils dragged him away to Sheol. And our blessed Lady Mary, the lover of mercy, came to that place shining with light, and the place was lighted up by her splendour, and she rebuked the devils and said unto them, ""He doth not belong to you, let him go, for he hath spent the greater part of his money in alms."" And the devils said unto her, ""He hath not given it away of his own free will."" And our Lady Mary said, ""Go ye and ask him whether he hath given away his money in alms of his own free will or not."" And whilst they were going to ask him, he awoke from his dream; and he rose up quickly and went to the good man and cried out with a loud voice, saying, ""I am satisfied with everything that thou hast done""; and he gave him other moneys, and he said, ""Spend them in alms on my behalf."" And he devoted himself to giving thanks unto our Lady Mary who had delivered him from the devils. Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933. One Hundred and Ten Miracles of Our Lady Mary, pp. 185-187.

Fol. 60a, No. 49.] THERE were two brothers in the city of Rome; the name of the one was Peter and that of the other Stephen. Now Peter was a deacon, and a governor in the church, and he did what was good, as was right, for the church, but he was a lover of money. And Stephen was a magistrate of the city, and he loved bribes, and in the excess of his extortion and wrong doing he robbed the church of Saint Sirloreyos, and filched from it certain houses; and he also robbed the church of our Lady Mary, and took from it a garden (or, plantation). And when Peter the deacon died they judged him for his actions and set him in the Jahannam of fire. And after a few days Stephen the extortioner died, and Sirloreyos went to him being wroth with him, and he seized his arm, and by reason of his exceedingly great strength the mark remained in his hand (or, arm). And they condemned him with the sentence of death. Now during his lifetime Stephen used to celebrate the festival of Saint Peter, and each year he used to give alms in abundance on the day of his festival, and make gifts to the churches. And as he was going to perdition Saint Peter appeared unto him, and he heard a mighty voice which said, ""O Peter, help thy friend who used to pay honour to thee and rejoice in thee, for, behold, they are carrying him to perdition."" And straightway Peter delivered him from the hands of the devil, and brought him to Sirloreyos, and forgave him his sin. And he entreated our Lady Mary, and she forgave him, and she took him before our Lord Jesus Christ, and she bowed low before Him and asked Him to take Stephen back to his body, and He agreed to do so. And then our Lady Mary, the compassionate one, said, ""Thou shalt only abide for thirty days—until thou payest back everything which thou hast taken by extortion, and thou shalt recite every day the psalm, 'Blessed are those who are pure in their way, who walk in the Law of God.' "" And as he was coming back he heard a great noise, and in that noise he heard the voice of his brother Peter. And he said unto him, ""O my brother, hast thou also been in the judgement?"" and his brother said unto him, ""I have been in Jahannam."" And he said unto him, ""Canst thou be saved?"" And he said unto him, ""Yea, if the father hath prayed together with all the priests who are in the church on my behalf."" And when Stephen returned into the world he told the father everything that had happened to him, and he showed him the mark in his hand where [Saint] Sirloreyos (sic) had gripped him, and he also told him that he was to live thirty days—until he had given back what he had taken [by oppression]. And the father prayed for him, and made offerings on behalf of Peter; and Stephen restored everything that he had taken, and re cited the psalm which our Lady Mary had commanded him to repeat daily. And after thirty days he died and entered into everlasting rest. May the blessing and sup plication of our Lady Mary be with us for ever and ever. Amen. Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933.

Mus. MS. Orient. No. 652. Fol. 61b, No. 50.] THERE was a certain rich and honourable man possessing much money and very great estates, and he was a knight. Now his sins were very many, and he loved eating, and drinking, and fornication. And he hated the poor and the needy, but he loved Michael the Archangel, and he celebrated his festival and rejoiced in him, and he served our Lady Mary, the compassion ate one, and he made salutations to her at all times. And one day, when he was sitting at his table, he meditated in his heart and said, ""Woe is me! I am a miser able wretch. How long shall I continue in [my] sin? Woe is me! With what face shall I stand before my Lord, and what shall be my answer [to Him], for I have never done any good thing? And now, I will make a monastery in my country, and I will establish saints therein, and when the building is finished I will become a monk and will dwell in it. And I will build the monastery in the name of Mary, and I will endow the monks."" And when he rose up from the table he com manded his servant to saddle his horse; and he mounted it and taking with him another man he rode out of the city and went about through his estate to look for a site whereon to build. And he found a site, a rocky eminence which streams of water surrounded on all sides, and he rejoiced that he had found a suitable place whereon to build the monastery in his own grounds. And he pondered as to the way in which he should build that monastery, and whilst he was thinking out the matter he died, and the devils seized his soul and wanted to cast it into Sheol. And Michael the Archangel met them, and said unto them, ""This soul doth not belong to you; set it free."" And the devils said unto him, ""If God judgeth rightly it will belong unto us."" And when Michael heard their words he held his peace [for a sea son], and then he said unto them, ""I will dispute with you for the possession of this soul before God."" And he went to our Lady Mary, the intercessor, and he said unto her, ""O mother of mercy, do not be unmindful of thy servant, and let him not be blotted out, for he used to serve thee and recite salutations to thee."" And our Lady Mary, the compassionate one, rose up and stood before our Lord Jesus Christ, and did homage unto Him, and she besought Him to give her that soul. And He said unto her, ""O My Mother, be not sad. I became man through thee in order to deliver the races of the children of men, and everything that thou askest I will grant unto thee."" And she said unto Him, ""I wish Thee to redeem this soul and to give it a reward, because it thought to build a monastery in my [honour], and to become a monk in it, and to glorify my name, and to do what was good. And whilst he was thinking out this matter he died; do not Thou blot out his re ward."" And our Lord commanded Michael to go and redeem his soul from out of the hand of the devils. And the Archangel went straightway to hear the judgement of Jesus Christ—to Him be praise!—and he said, ""God hath had mercy upon him; it was not His judgement, but His mercy.""

Orient. MS. No. 652. Fol. 64b, No. 52.] THERE was in the city of Rome a certain bishop who was attached to the episcopal throne of Peter; and he was a lover of money and in his excessive audacity he sold the holy oil (meron) belonging to the church. And after he had received the price of the same, Mar Peter appeared unto him, and rebuked him, and said unto him, ""How didst thou dare to sell the holy oil wherewith the Christians are anointed? Woe be unto thee for the punishment that awaiteth thee."" Now when the Papa heard these words he was afraid. And he called a council, and gathered together the priests, and the great men, and the learned, and the religious folk, and he told them about what he had seen, and how the Apostle Peter had appeared unto him and rebuked him. And he said unto them, ""I beseech you to speak to me words of counsel."" And when they had heard his speech about him that had appeared unto him and he had told them about his sin, there was none of them who would answer him a word. And when he saw that there was no one who would help him, and that there was no one who would give him counsel, his sorrow and his weeping increased. And again he said unto them, ""Ye are wise men of the world and men of understanding, is there no one among you who can answer me?"" And there rose up a certain old man who was wise, and he stood up among them and said unto him, ""If thou wilt hearken unto me I will advise thee, and I will tell thee what thou must do in order to benefit thy soul."" And he said unto him, ""There is no other thing for thee except to set thy hope upon Mary, the compassionate Lady, and to seek help from her, for she is a mediatress, and doth not reject the petitions of the poor and needy."" And when that bishop heard this word, he knew that it was true, and he rose up straight way, and departed to the church of our Lady Mary. And he prostrated himself before the altar, and he wept very bitter tears, and he smote upon his breast as he made supplication unto her. And our Lady Mary ap peared unto him, and she rebuked him and said unto him, ""Who hath brought thee into this my house to defile it with thy mouth which is full of cursing and guile? Rise up and get thee forth [from it]."" And she disappeared from him. And when he heard these words his sorrow was increased, and his pain multiplied, and his weeping was more abundant. And he stood there imploring her aid, and he persisted in petitioning her, and he made his face to burn [as he rubbed it] on the ground. And our Lady the Virgin Mary appeared unto him a second time, and she said unto him, ""Did I not say unto thee, Get thee forth from my house and come not back?"" And she disappeared from him. And the bishop said unto her with humbleness and sorrow of heart, ""O my Lady Mary, mother of light, and mother of mercy, who hast compassion on the race of the children of men, the object of boasting of the Christians, the haven of ships, how canst thou be called the mother of mercy after this day? for I cast myself upon thee, and I threw my soul down before thee. I beseech and entreat thee not to set me far away from thy mercy and thy compassion."" And straightway the heart of our Lady Mary was moved with compassion for him, and she stood up before the great throne of our Lord Jesus Christ, and she bowed down before Him and implored Him to forgive the bishop his sin, and to have com passion upon him. And she said unto Him, ""O Sea of mercy, and Fountain of life, treat not with contempt this my petition on behalf of this wretched man who hath confessed his sin, and who hath asked for mercy in making entreaty unto me."" And straightway He said unto her, ""What thou hast asked of Me is conceded, and thy prayer is accepted by Me, and I have forgiven his sin for thy sake."" And straightway she took Mar Peter and she appeared unto the bishop and said unto him, ""Our Lord Jesus Christ hath forgiven thee thy sin; do not commit the like again. And speak these words also to Peter."" And the bishop rejoiced with a great joy and he went forth and gathered together the people and told them what our Lady Mary, the com passionate one, had done for him, and they praised God the Most High and gave thanks to our Lady Mary.

Fol. 67a.] THERE was a certain priest who loved money, and also a man who loved gifts (i.e. bribes); now the latter fell sick of a serious disease. And the priest heard of the sickness of the man of bribes, and he went to him to visit him, and he spake unto him words of cheerful ness, saying, ""God forbid, my lord. No evil shall befall you. God shall have compassion upon you, be not afraid. Nevertheless reckon up thy possessions, for thou wilt not die because thou hast reckoned them up."" And as the priest was talking to him—now there was a deacon [with him]—a handmaiden came and said unto the priest, ""Rise up, and administer the Eucharist to an old woman who is in tribulation."" Now the old woman was a good and holy woman, and she served in the church, and feared God, and she was poor and she loved our Lady Mary, the compassionate. And when the priest heard the words of the handmaiden he said unto her angrily, ""How can I possibly leave a man of such high position as this to go to an old woman? Fear not, moreover, O my daughter, for there are many days for the aged"" (i.e. they live a long time). And the deacon said unto the priest, ""Rise up, [and go] for the old woman feareth God and loveth our Lady Mary, and if she dieth without the Eucharist it will be imputed to thee for sin."" And the priest said unto him, ""Fear thou not, the old woman will not die, for the days of the aged are many."" And that old woman used to pray to, and worship, and minister to our Lady Mary, and everything which she obtained possession of, whether it was wax or whether it was oil, she used to give to the church, and in every way she took refuge in our Lady Mary. And the handmaiden came back again to the priest, and she said unto him, ""Rise up, come that thou mayest administer the Eucharist to the old woman, for she is in great agony."" And the deacon said unto the priest, ""If thou refusest to go I myself will go and ad minister the Eucharist ""; and the priest said unto him, ""Go, and leave me with this man of wealth and position, for my heart hath loved him for many days."" And the deacon departed and took the Body of our Lord from the church, and then went on to the old woman. And the old woman was sitting in a dark chamber, and when the deacon drew nigh to the place, he saw a great light proceeding from the room. And he looked in and saw many women sitting with the old woman, and they were arrayed in light and were twelve in number. And our Lady Mary was sitting by the head of the old woman, and her face was shining with the brightness of the lightning, and she had in her hand a napkin wherewith she wiped away the sweat from [the face of] the old woman. Now the old woman was in the agony of death, and she was sweating through the intensity of the pain. And the deacon was terrified at the sight which he saw, and our Lady Mary made a sign to him with her hand, and she said unto him, ""Keep back and listen to what I am going to say unto thee, and administer the Holy Mystery unto her."" And she said unto the women, ""Arise, let us go away until her soul and body are saved""; and the deacon administered to the old woman the Holy Mystery. And the deacon de parted to the priest, rejoicing at what he had seen and heard, but concerning this he told the priest nothing. And the man who loved bribes decreed in his will that he gave all his property to his wife, and he gave her power to dispose of what she pleased and to retain what she pleased. And the deacon saw several black creatures like cats with claws and tails, and they were thrusting themselves into the mouth and nostrils of the man, and he was shrieking and crying out, saying, ""Drive away these cats, for my soul is suffering the tortures of hell."" And the deacon suddenly saw a great and terrifying Satan of a frightful form come down and stand upon that man's head, and he had in his hand a red-hot spear which he thrust into the body of the man, and his soul went forth. Thus the priest obtained nothing for his labour except weariness and exhaustion. And the deacon went again to that old woman to visit her, and he saw a large company of angels, and our Lady Mary standing among them; and behold, the old woman died, and they took her pure soul and carried it up into heaven.

Fol. 69a, No. 55.] THERE was a religious house in a certain city, and in it was a young widow of goodly person, and she loved our Lady Mary, the compassionate one, and rejoiced in celebrating her festivals. And Satan was envious of her, and he plotted against her by means of a certain rich young knight who loved her and sent gifts unto her; and Satan made love for him to take root in her heart. And he said unto her, ""Let me send some of my servants at midnight to bring thee unto me""; and she said unto him, ""I agree."" And on the night about which they had made the compact together, the widow sat in the church waiting for the envoys of the knight. And slumber seized her, and it seemed to her in her dream that the devils carried her off and brought her into Sheol to a place where there was great wailing, and she saw them casting many people into it. And she cried out to our Lady Mary and begged for her help, but our Lady Mary stood up above Sheol, being filled with wrath against her. And when the widow continued to cry out ever more and more our Lady Mary said unto her, ""Thou criest out, but thou dost not wish for my help; thou wishest to go to the knight and to leave me, and the knight wisheth to leave thee in this place."" And at that moment the devils cast her into Sheol, and our Lady Mary said, ""I do not wish to have her destroyed, and I will save her."" And the widow, being terrified and shaking with fright, cried out loudly. And when she saw the servants of the knight standing up there and waiting for her, she cried out against them and reviled them, and said unto them, ""Your lord wisheth to drag me down into Sheol, and if ye do not be gone I will tell the mother of the nunnery, and others."" And the servants of the knight turned away and they told their lord what had happened. And when he knew about her dream, he repented of what he had done, and he wept with a great weeping because of his manifold sins. And he said, ""Woe is me! I have become a thing meet for Sheol, and a stone of stumbling in the path of the believers."" And he rose up straight way, and sold all his goods and possessions, and distributed the money in alms. And he departed to the desert, and submitted himself to a priest, and he dwelt as a solitary until he died, and he entered into the kingdom of heaven through the prayer of the Virgin Mary. Budge, E.

Fol. 70a.] AND it came to pass in the city of Rome in the days of 'Afara, the king, that certain men made a journey to the city in order that they might worship therein. And as they were going along they stopped at a church which was dedicated in the name of Paul, and by the side of it was another which was dedicated in the name of our Lady Mary, and the people brought food for them to eat. And they found a man there who was seated, and who made sport of them and jested at them, saying, ""My lord is better than your lord, and my dear one is better than your dear one."" And the brethren marvelled at him, and they made enquiries about him, and the people said to them, ""This is a cattle herd. And behold, being weary of watching his cattle, and exhausted by the great labour of keeping them together, he gave himself to Satan that he might take him away from it and give him rest from his toil."" And when the brethren heard this they were exceedingly sorry, and they rose up straightway and went into the church of Mark (sic), and began to entreat our Lady Mary on behalf of that man. And they said in their prayer, ""O All-powerful-One, who didst direct Paul when he was an enemy of the faithful, and didst make him a preacher in Thy Name, and an obedient servant of Thine, we beseech Thee and we beseech Mary Thy mother, to have compassion upon this poor and wretched man, and to save him from this Satan by Thy mercy."" And whilst they were praying one of the brethren went out and looked at that man who was weeping, and he said unto the brother, ""Why do ye pray for me? Cannot ye see my friend standing by the door, and waiting for me to die?"" And the brother returned to the church, and told his brethren that their prayer would be heard by God, and he commanded them not to cease praying. And the brother went into the church of our Lady Mary, and the man who had sold himself to the Dev1l went in with him. And the brother commanded him to confess his sins, and he arrayed him in the garb of the brethren, and they took him with them into the city of Rome, and they made him a monk with them. And God had mercy upon him, and he remained in this world suffering punishment, and at the last day he suffered no punishment. And at times Satan used to lay hold of him and beat him; and sometimes he would drag him about by the hair of his head, and by his feet and his hands. And whensoever he saw Satan coming to him, he used to cry out from the depths of his heart; and whenever the brethren heard his cry they would come to him, and lay hold upon him and help him with their prayer. And he continued to suffer from this disease for the space of two years, and then our Lady Mart had compassion upon him, and drove Satan away from him, and saved him. Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933.

Mus. Orient. No. 652. Fol. 72b, No. 58.] THERE was a certain knight who exulted in his splendid youth and strength, and boasted himself in the abundance of his riches, and he loved a woman who lived in a certain city, and he gave her much money in order to obtain her, but although he gave her many gifts he was unable to get possession of her body. And he loved her far more than anything else, and by reason of his excessive love for her he ceased not [to think] of her by day and by night, and at length he became mad. And when he did not know what else to do he went to a certain monastery wherein lived a holy man who feared God and loved our Lady Mary, the compassionate one, and he confessed his sins and bowed down before him by reason of the greatness of his love for that woman. And when the Father heard his words and saw the sorrow of his heart he said unto him, ""O my brother, if thou wilt accept what I am going to say to thee, thou shalt obtain thy desire from this woman whom thou lovest."" And the knight said unto him, ""There is no command of thine which I would transgress concerning the love of that woman if only thou wilt enable me to obtain her."" And the Father said unto him, ""If thou wilt hearken unto what I shall say unto thee thou shalt obtain thy wish."" And the knight said unto him, ""There is nothing in the world that shall be too hard for me to do for the love of that woman."" And the Father said unto him, ""If thou wilt say, 'Salutation, O our Lady Mary,' two and fifty times each day thou shalt obtain thy desire."" And the knight said unto him, ""This is an easy thing for me to do""; and the Father said, ""This is not an easy thing, but if thou wilt say it for the period of one year thou wilt find everything that thou seekest."" So the knight took this labour upon him, and he rose up from before the Father rejoicing in this labour, and he forsook every other work, and concentrated his mind on the prayer. And when the knight had come nigh to complete the year, he determined to go a hunting, and he invited his friends to go with him, and he took his slaves, and they departed into the desert and spread themselves out to hunt. And when it was the time of noon, he remained alone, and he could not find any one of his men, and having become separated entirely from them whilst he was searching for them, he saw a little ruined church in the desert, and he remembered that he had not recited his ""Salutation"" to our Lady Mary that day. And he went to the church, and he alighted from his horse and went into the church, and he saw therein an old picture whereon was painted a figure of our Lady Mary. And he stood up before her, and he prayed with reverence, and he meditated upon our Lady Mary, and the beauty of her apparel, and her mouth, and her teeth, and the sweetness of her voice. And he was sad and said, ""O my Lady Mary, when shall thy mercy come to me, and when shall I obtain my desire? Behold, the year hath come to an end."" And as he was wishing to leave the church our Lady Mary appeared unto him, and she was wearing the apparel of light, and on her head was a crown wrought with gold and studded with gems of price, and her face was shining, and the radiance and brilliance of the lightning flashed from her garments. And when the knight saw her he was stunned with the beauty of her person and her majesty, and he prostrated himself before her. And she raised him up and said unto him, ""I am she whom thou didst petition to bring thee to thy desire and to thy darling. Tell me now: wouldst thou have me for thy darling or her?"" And he said unto her, ""O my Lady, how couldst thou possibly be darling to me?"" And she said unto him, ""If thou wilt serve me another year I will take thee with me to the kingdom of heaven, which shall never come to an end. But thou must never cease from my service, and thou must never worship anyone else except myself."" And then she disappeared from him. And the knight went forth from the church rejoicing, and happy at what he had seen. And he went to the Father and told him everything that our Lady Mary had said unto him, and he became a monk with him, and there was left in his heart nothing except the remembrance of our Lady Mary and of the sweetness of her voice and the beauty of her person. And he served her also another year, and died in peace, and our Lady Mary took him even as she had promised him, and he was saved from the Enemy, and from his tribulations by the prayer of the pure Virgin.

Mus. MS. Orient. No. 652. Fol. 74a, No. 59.] THERE was a monk in a certain monastery who was keeper of the treasury of the church, and he played upon the horn at all times and seasons; now he was a priest, and he feared God and loved our Lady Mary with all his heart, and he ministered unto her by day and by night, and he entreated her to appear to him either in a dream or when he was awake. And he prayed this prayer continually and said, ""O my Lady Mary, since thy picture (or, image) upon earth is adorned with such great honour and is beloved by all, what must thy glory be in heaven?"" And by reason of the greatness of his love for her he said unto her, ""O my Lady Mary, if thou canst not appear unto me in visible form because I am unworthy [of this honour], I beseech thee to appear unto me in a dream by night so that I may be satisfied with a sight of thy beautiful form."" And in the intensity of his crying the tears poured down his face, and he went to his bed, for he was exhausted by keeping long vigil. And as he slept he saw in his dream that the whole church was filled with such bright light that he thought it was on fire. And he rose up quickly and went into the church, and he saw our Lady Mary standing there arrayed in apparel of gold wherein precious stones had been worked, and upon her head was a crown which no person living on the earth could look upon, and rays like the lightning flash shot forth from her eyes. And the monk knew that she was our Lady Mary. And he saw in her hand a roll written in gold in writing like which no man could write in all the world, and he prostrated himself before her. And she said unto him, ""What dost thou wish for?"" And he said unto her, ""O my Lady, I beseech thee to show me what is written in the roll."" And she said unto him, ""Look thou at what is in it—the Prophecy of Isaiah""; and again he prostrated himself at her feet. And she said unto him, ""What dost thou wish for?"" And he said unto her, ""O my Lady, I beseech thee to allow me to approach to thy feet that I may kiss them."" And she said unto him, ""Far be it from thee that thou shouldst kiss my feet with thy holy mouth wherewith thou hast consecrated the Offering and said the prayers of consecration, and pronounced the benediction of Peace for many days. But kiss thou my cheek with thy pure mouth."" And he kissed her cheek, and through the fervour of his kissing and the sweetness of her joy he awoke from his dream. And straightway the dawn broke and the brethren assembled in the church and prayed, but he continued to think upon the beauty of our Lady Mary, and the sweetness of her voice, and her splendid apparel; and he neither opened his mouth nor uttered a single word of prayer. And when they had finished their prayer they came to him in a body and re buked him because he had not prayed with them. And the chief [monk] beat him, but he did not feel what they were doing, because of the sweetness of our Lady Mary, the love of whom had taken possession of his heart. And he walked the straight road, and served our Lady Mary, the compassionate one, until he died and entered into the kingdom of heaven. Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933.

Aeth. 69, No. 49, Fol. 53a.] A MIRACLE of our Lady Mary: may her prayer and supplication preserve Tanshe' Krestos! Amen. Among the monks of the Monastery of Sarabyon (Serapion) there was a certain monk whose name was Natan (Nathan), and he held the office of steward and watched over the treasures (i.e. revenues) of the church. And he used to blow a trumpet (or, horn?) when the times for prayer arrived, for he was a priest and an elder, and he was an excellent man and a fearer of God, and he loved our Lady Mary with all his heart, and he used to minister unto her in the church by day and by night. And with many groans he used to entreat Mary to address to him comfortable words at night, either when he was asleep or when he was awake, and he prayed to her continually to appear unto him. And he said, ""O my Lady, Mother of mercy and compassion, behold, since thy picture which is upon the earth is decorated gloriously, and is preferred to 'thousands of gold [and silver],' and is beloved by everyone, how splendid must thy glory be which is in heaven!"" And because of the greatness of his love for her he said unto her, ""I beseech thee, O my Lady Virgin, if thou art not able to show thyself unto me in thine actual form because it is not meet for me, I entreat thee to reveal unto me in a dream of the night a vision of thy face and the beauty of thy bodily form which I should hold to be sweeter than wine and delicate food made with honey. And each morning I will multiply for thee the signs of my love for thee."" And having recited these words, and made an end [of his prayers], he rose up and went to his couch. And the tears poured down his face, for he was wearied with standings up and with vigils, and then he lay down and slept. And on that very day at midnight he saw a great light which filled the church, and thinking that the building was on fire he rose up straightway, and went hurriedly into the church. And he saw our Lady Mary standing therein, and she was arranged in splendid apparel wherein gold and colours were woven, and she was adorned with a pearl which shone brightly. And upon her head was a crown which all those who are on the earth could not gaze upon, and its splendour shot out rays of light, and fascinated the eyes. And when he saw this he knew and understood that it was our Lady Mary. And again he saw in her hand a book which was written in gold, and there was not a man in the world who was able to read one word of it. And he bowed low with the knees of his heart upon the ground before the eyes of our Lady Mary. And Mary said unto him, ""Tell me, O man, what it is thou seekest and what it is thou desirest."" And he answered and said unto her, ""O my Lady, I beseech thee to show me the book which is in thy hand."" And our Lady Mary said unto him, ""Take and look at what is therein—the prophecy of Isaiah, the prophet."" And again he bowed low at her feet. And Mary said unto him, ""And now what dost thou desire?"" And he an swered and said unto her, ""O my Lady, I beseech thee to give me leave to kiss thy feet,"" And she said unto him, ""God forbid that thou shouldst kiss my feet with thy holy mouth wherewith thou dost present the Offer ing. And thou hast sanctified thy hands and hast ad ministered the Holy Mystery therewith to the people, and thou hast never omitted the Salutation to me which is arranged to be said daily. But come and kiss my cheek with thy pure mouth."" And he drew nigh unto her and kissed her cheek, and the sweet perfume of her was diffused in his nose and mouth. And he became drunk in his spirit (or, soul) like a man who hath drunk newly fermented wine, and he went forth rejoicing and happy and filled with laughter. And he awoke from his sleep and found that the day had already dawned, and he blew the trumpet according to his wont, and the people assembled in the church and they all prayed together. Now he separated himself from their company, and did not pray with them, and he was meditating in his heart upon the beauty and the goodliness of her person, and the sweetness of her voice, and [the splendour of] her apparel, and the magnificence of her majesty. And because of this he never opened his mouth at all, and did not utter a word. And when the monks had finished their morning prayers they gathered together about him, and reviled him, and the archimandrite was wroth with him and smote him with [his] staff, and he did not know what they said unto him and why they reviled him, and why they smote him with a stick, because of the drunkenness of the spirit which was caused by absorbing the sweet perfume of Mary as if he had drunk wine. And the love for her sprouted and blossomed in his heart, and he walked in the right way, and he served and ministered unto her all the day of his life until he died in peace and entered into the kingdom of the heavens. May the supplication and entreaty of our Lady Mary the Virgin, and her prayer and blessing be with us. Amen. Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933. One Hundred and Ten Miracles of Our Lady Mary, pp. 210-212.

Mus. MS. Orient. No. 652. Fol. 75b, No. 60.] THERE was a certain very rich merchant who trafficked by land and by sea, but the condition of affairs changed in respect of him, and all his money came to an end, and his establishment went to ruin, and his assistants were dispersed, and his servants ceased to be because he had fallen into poverty. And when he saw that he had fallen from his state of glory, and that his joy was turned into sorrow, his mind was grievously oppressed, and he was unable to bear himself. And he said, ""Henceforth I cannot dwell in this city, but I will go into another country where I shall be able to live on much or on little, and if I steal there will be none to bring a charge against me, and if I beg there will be none who will know me."" And he went forth from the city in sadness, and he took to flight with the tears pouring down his face. And Satan met him on the way and said unto him, ""O my brother, why art thou sorrowful? Why weepest thou?"" And the merchant said unto him, ""Who art thou that I should tell thee what hath befallen me?"" And the Devil said unto him, ""I am Satan."" And the merchant said unto him, ""If thou art Satan, art thou able to help me?"" And then the merchant told him everything that had befallen him, and how he was going into another city to live where he could steal or beg. And Satan said unto him, ""If thou wilt accept my words thou canst become all the days of thy life far richer than before."" And he said unto him, ""Open thy wallet, and take out what is therein""; and the merchant opened his wallet, and he gave him two pearls that were gems of great price. And because of the greatness of his joy the merchant said unto Satan, ""What dost thou wish me to do for thee?"" And Satan said unto him, ""Deny Christ, and the Cherubim, and the Seraphim, and Baptism, and Christianity, and Mary."" And when the merchant heard the conclusion of his words he said, ""I will deny all these, with the exception of Mary, and her I will never deny."" And Satan said unto him, ""If thou wilt not deny Mary all else that thou mayest do will not profit thee""; and thus saying Satan left him and disappeared from his sight. And the merchant opened his wallet so that he might look at the pearls, and they were transformed and had become sand. And he was exceedingly sad, and he said, ""Woe is me! Most assuredly it hath not profited me that I have made an end of my money, and forsaken my city and my people, and have also made an end of my belief and sinned against Christ my Creator."" And he went along the road weeping, and as he pondered he was very sad. Now as he was journeying on he came upon a ruined (or, lonely) church by the side of the road, and he went in that he might rest, and he saw there a picture (or, image) of our Lady Mary. And he wept bitterly before her, and shed floods of tears, and with a sorrowful heart he said, ""O my Lady Mary, I put my trust in thy compassion: Thou knowest that I did not deny thee, and I beseech thee to commend me to the love of thy Son Who went forth from thy belly""; and through his exceedingly great sorrow he fell asleep. And our Lady Mary, the compassionate one, appeared unto him with her Son Who was sitting upon His throne, and she stood before Him and said unto Him, ""O my Son, I beseech Thee to forgive the sin of this miserable man and sinner."" And the Lord Jesus said unto her, ""I will not forgive him because he denied Me and My angels."" And when she heard this she wept bitterly, saying, ""I beseech Thee, O my Son, to forgive this sinner his sin. I adjure Thee by my breasts which Thou hast sucked."" And our Lord Jesus Christ said unto her, ""I will not forgive this wicked man, for he denied Me and My angels, and rejected his baptism and his Christianity."" And when she heard this, she stripped off her apparel, and said unto Him as she drew out her breasts, ""If Thou wilt not forgive him for my sake, I will slit open my breasts and rip up my body."" And when our Lord saw what she would do He rose up from His throne and sat in her bosom, and embraced her and kissed her, and dried His mother's tears with His holy hair (?). And He said unto her, ""Be not sad, O My Mother, I forgive him his sin for thy sake."" And our Lady Mary went to the man and said unto him, ""Henceforth thou shalt sin no more. Rise up and pray to God for the salvation of thy soul""; and then she disappeared from him. And the merchant awoke from his dream, and went to a monastery and became a monk.

Fol. 78a.] THERE was a certain herdsman who pastured sheep and cattle, and he was a simple man, and he loved our Lady Mary with all his heart, and he served her, and he stood up before her in every place, and he never ceased to say the salutation of the Angel Gabriel to her. And that salutation was in his mouth by day and by night, in going and coming, in sitting down and rising up. Now on the night of the festival of our Lady Mart a heavy mist rose up and there was snow. And the man expected that his beasts would die of the great cold, and he was sad, and he went outside his house and looked at the sky, and he began to pray to God, and turning his eyes to our Lady Mary he said, ""O Lady Mary, be not far from my beasts, and have mercy upon thy servants who serve thee by day and by night, and diminish not the fodder of these beasts which through the compassion of thy Son feed on thy gracious gifts."" And when he had finished his prayer he fell upon the ground, and there was a break in the storm and a period of rest. And when the man saw [this] he gave thanks unto our Lady Mary, the mother of mercy. And she appeared unto him and said unto him, ""How long hast thou toiled? I wish to take thee so that thou mayest have rest."" And he said unto her, ""Until when, O my Lady?"" And she said unto him, ""Until the seventh day. And go to the monastery and tell the Archimandrite that he must make thee to rest from thy toil seven days by the word of the miracle which I spake to him under the tree."" And then she disappeared from him. And the shepherd went to the monastery, and when the monks saw him they said unto him, ""Why hast thou come? Hast thou left thy beasts?"" And he said unto them, ""I wish to speak to the Archimandrite."" And they said unto him, ""What canst thou want with the Archimandrite? If thou wishest to obtain consolation (i.e. to confess) speak to one of the brethren""; and the man said, ""I will speak to the Archimandrite only."" And the monks went to the Archimandrite and told him about the coming of the shepherd, and how he would speak to no one but him. And they said to him, ""Behold, he hath come and left his beasts. And we said unto him, If thou wishest to obtain consolation speak to one of the brethren; but he said, I will only speak to the Archimandrite."" And the Archimandrite rose up from his chamber, and went to the shepherd. And the shepherd bowed down at the feet of the Archimandrite and told him all that our Lady Mary had said unto him, and of the miracle (or, sign) under the tree. And when the Archimandrite heard of this miracle he understood, and straightway fell down at the feet of the shepherd. And he took him to his own abode, and he arrayed him in purple, and he paid him honour and ministered unto him, and he asked him to intercede with God on his behalf. And when seven days were ended he ordered the monks to leave their work and to gather together in the chamber of the brethren, and he commanded the shepherd to pray on behalf of them all. And the brethren marvelled at that act, and they said to one another, ""This man hath no [ascetic] toil [to his credit], what doth he wish to do?"" And whilst the brethren were talking together, the shepherd died forthwith. And the Archimandrite began to tell the brethren the matter of the man, and why our Lady Mary had sent him to him, and then he urged them to increase their service to her, and to pay special honour to her, for she rewardeth all those who minister unto her with good things both in heaven and upon earth. And when the monks heard these words they were exceedingly sorry that they had reviled the shepherd, and they entreated God to forgive them their sins. And they gave thanks unto our Lady Mary, the compassionate. Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933. One Hundred and Ten Miracles of Our Lady Mary, pp. 314-316. London: Oxford University Press, H.

One day he went out from the city and gathered together much brushwood, and he tied it in a bundle and lifted it up upon his head. And as he was coming into the city he came to the gate and saw a picture of our Lady Mary, and straightway he cast his load from his head into the gateway and he stood up and bowed to our Lady Mary. And many people were coming through the gate, and were unable to pass each other, and the gate-keeper rose up and said, ""What is the cause of this blocking of the way?"" And they told him, ""This young man hath cast his load down in the roadway."" And the gate-keeper turned and saw the young man standing opposite the picture (or, image) of our Lady Mary. And when the young man bowed to it the head of the figure shrouded itself in a covering, whilst the keeper of the gate looked on at the miracle. And he rose up and abased the young man and said unto him, ""Whence comest thou, and what dost thou do?"" And the young man said unto him, ""I am a poor man and I live by the labour of my hands."" And the keeper of the gate said unto him, ""I have seen Mart paring honour unto thee, and I also will pay thee hon our through love of her."" And the young man went to take up the brushwood, but the keeper of the gate stopped him and [then] he took him to his house, and he washed him, and cleansed hm from his dirt, and he dressed him in apparel, and gave him his daughter to wife, and gave him all his possessions. And the keeper of the gate arrayed himself in the garb of the monk. And the young man became rich through the petition of our Lady Mart, and he acquired all his wealth through love of her. And those who serve her become rich in heaven and upon earth: may her blessing be with us all for ever. Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933. One Hundred and Ten Miracles of Our Lady Mary, pp. 317-318.

185,The rich woman who went with the monks to the manbalis for prayer and there saw a vision of Saint Mary.,,,LIT3921Miracle,"CV THE VIRGIN MARY AND HER IMAGE WHICH BOWED TO THE MONKS [Brit. Mus. MS. Orient. No. 652. Fol. 14a.] IT is related that there was a certain monastery the monks of which were in the habit of going to a church of our Lady Mary at each of her festivals, and celebrating there a great festival. And when they were journeying thither to keep the festival in that church, there went with them a certain noble lady who was exceedingly rich, and who belonged to a great family. And she feared God and loved our Lady Mary, and she loved the monks and men of good works. And as she travelled with them on the road she fed them and maintained them until they arrived at that church which was a long way from their monastery. And because of the great affection which the monks had for that lady they brought her into the church at the time of the prayer of our Lady Mary. And as that woman was standing up with them, she saw the monks bowing to an image of our Lady Mary at the time of prayer. And she saw the head of our Lady Mary bow to them, and saw that their prayer and worship were accepted. And when they finished their prayer that woman saw our Lady Mary come down from the altar, and she stood up before the monks, and addressed to each one of them words of approbation, and she rejoiced in their works. And when that woman saw this, she marvelled exceedingly, and she praised God and gave thanks to our Lady Mary, and she told the monks about everything which she had seen. And when they heard this thing from her they rejoiced exceedingly, and multiplied [their] service and praise of our Lady Mary. And when the festival was ended, the monks came back to their monastery praising God. And that woman returned to her town and went into her house, and she told her son and all her household and kinsfolk what she had seen, and she commanded them to show affection to the brethren, the monks, and to obey them, and to give thanks to our Lady Mary, and to serve her, and to love her more dearly than anything else in the world. And all her household and kinsfolk ministered unto the monks, and showed them affection, and they served our Lady Mart, and glorified her, and exalted her, and magnified her. And that woman continued to serve our Lady Mary with all her heart until she died and entered into the kingdom of heaven through the intercession of our Lady Mary, who is compassionate unto all those who serve her.

Fol. 12b, 1.] NOW there was a certain artificer who loved our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-bearer, with all his heart, and he was wont to address Salutations unto her day by day regularly, both morning and evening, and he continued to do this for many days. And it came to pass one day that he said unto her, ""O my gracious Lady, I address Salutations unto thee continually, but thou dost never return my salutation unto me."" And after he had said these words unto her he began to read the [Forty-two] Salutations to our Lady Mary, standing before her picture (or, image). And when he came to the passage wherein he said, ""Blessed art thou among women,"" our Lady Mary, the God-bearer, answered him from out of her picture, and said unto him, ""And blessed art thou among men."" And these words she spake unto him thrice. And when the artificer heard these words from the picture of our Lady Mary, he bowed down before her, and repented himself that he had dared to speak unto her; but he rejoiced because of the words which she had spoken unto him. And he loved her much more than before, and he devoted himself with additional zeal to her service until he passed away from this fleeting world. Inasmuch as the angel of glad tidings gave thee an everlasting salutation, The artificer was dear unto thee; Since thou, O Mary, wast blessed by the Book of Hawi, Bless me, O my Lady, and may thy Son, the Nazarene, [bless me] With the blessings of Judah and Levi.

Fol. 84b, No. 67.] THERE was a certain Jew who possessed a herd of cows, and he had a son who used to pasture the cows outside the city with Christian children. And one day the cowherds gathered together to eat bread, and the son of the Jew came to eat with them. And they said unto him, ""Thou art a Jew and we are Christians; thou canst not eat with us until thou becomest a Chris tian like ourselves."" And he said unto them, ""Bring ye me to Christianity""; and they said unto him, ""Sit down."" And the cowherds took water from the vessel from which they drank, and sprinkled it on the head of the Jewish youth, and they said unto him, ""We baptize thee in the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and thy name shall be Garanin."" And straightway he sat down and ate with them, and when they called him by name they said ""Garanin."" And when the evening came the young Jew returned to the house of his father, and one saw a great light on him, and smelled an aroma that was more pleasant than that of any other scent, and it was sweeter than the smell of wine and unguent; and he sat down, and the people became drunk through the smell of his perfume. And the Jew said unto his son in the presence of his wife, ""Tell me, whence hast thou this sweet smell? Tell me quickly, so that I may not kill thee."" And the young man said unto him, ""O my father, I know not; no one hath perfumed me."" And his father said unto him, ""Tell me what thou hast done this day in the desert."" And the young man told him everything that the sons of the Christians had done to him, and how they stopped him from eating with them until they had baptized him, and how they had called him ""Garanin."" And when his father heard these words he was wroth with a great wrath, and they said, ""What shall we do with this wicked young man?"" And when the Jews saw this light and smelled the sweet perfume that emanated from him they became Christians. But the wife of the Jew said unto her husband, ""Get thee to such and such a man, the heater of the bath, and order him to light a great fire, and throw the young man into it so that he may be consumed."" And his father took him and carried him to the man who heated the bath, and he said unto him, ""Light a fire in the furnace of the bath""; and he did so, and he cast the young man into the furnace of fire, and shut the door of the furnace upon him. And in the morning of the following day a certain man of noble rank went to the bath-house to bathe, and he found the water cold. And he called the bath-keeper and told him to heat the bath for him, and when the bath-keeper went to the furnace he found it closed and with no fire inside it; and when he opened the door he found the young man sitting down, and the fire extinguished. And the bath-keeper said unto him, ""Who brought thee hither?"" And the young man said unto him with tears, ""My father cast me in here that the fire might consume me. And there came unto me a woman who was the most beautiful of women, and she took me to her bosom, and she extinguished the fire, and departed. And I did not wish either that thou shouldst or shouldst not come."" And when the bath-keeper heard this he cried out with a loud voice, and a crowd of men gathered together, and they brought out the young man from the furnace, and they took him to the bishop. And when the father and the mother of the young man heard that their son was alive they went to the bishop, and when they saw their son they cried out, saying, ""We brought him up in the Jewish Faith, and he hath become a believer in the Christian Faith."" And the young man told them everything that had befallen him from first to last, and all those who were there marvelled. And the bishop commanded that the youth should be fed [at his expense] all the days of his life, and he baptized the Jew and his wife; and many Jews were baptized on that day through the miracle that our Lady Mary, the mother of the Light, had wrought.

Fol. 86b, No. 68.] THERE was a certain man of huge stature who was an artisan, and his name was Golyad, and he was in charge of many men. He was as strong as a lion, and he went about the world ravening and took no thought about his end. And one day as he was going to his work he came to a monastery of the saints of our Lady Mary, and the archimandrite did not pay him honour because of his wickedness. And when Golyad saw that the monks and their archimandrite treated him with contempt he was wroth, and said, ""When I return I will lay waste their monastery so thoroughly that every one shall say there has never been a monastery with monks in it in this place."" And after he had de parted the monks heard what he had said concerning them, and they were sorrowful and greatly afraid, and said, ""He is a wicked man, and he will do everything that he said he would do."" And the monks and their archimandrite went to petition our Lady Mary, and they and their archimandrite prayed and lifted up their eyes to her. And whilst their holy archimandrite was praying, he fell asleep for a little space, and he saw as it were in his dream our holy Lady Mary among the saints, and she was saying, ""Who will go and kill that wicked man Golyad?"" And she turned round and saw a knight, a martyr who was buried in that monastery; and his horse was tethered near his weapons, and his arms were hanging up in the church, that is to say, his spear, his sword, and his shield. And our Lady Mary said unto that martyr, ""Rise up quickly, gird on thy armour, mount thy horse, and slay the enemy of my Son and my enemy, Golyad."" And he rose up straight way from out of the grave, and he took his arms, and mounted his horse and departed. And the archimandrite woke up out of his sleep, and he told his brethren what he had seen, and they went to the grave of the knight and they found that he was not in it and that it was empty. And they went into the church, and they could not find the knight's armour, and they said, ""Verily the martyr hath gone to destroy Golyad the sinner."" And the martyr scattered those who were with the horses of Golyad, and none of them saw him except Golyad. And Golyad said, ""Keep this horseman away from me for he hath come to kill me""; and as he was saying these words the martyr thrust his sword through his heart and killed him, and his soldiers were scattered. And then the martyr returned to his grave. And when the monks came again into the church, they saw his armour hanging up, and his spear was covered with clotted blood, and his horse was dripping with his sweat. And they knew that the wicked man Golyad had been slain by the command of our Lady Mary, the Virgin, the helper of all those who serve her. Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933.

And the pagan loved that picture exceedingly, and he cleaned it, and rubbed it, and used to stand before it and salute it. And he used to ponder in his mind and say, ""Can it possibly be true that God, the Creator of the universe, was pleased to abase Himself and come down from His glorious state and put on human flesh? I cannot believe that a virgin could conceive and bear a child without the seed of man, and that her virginity could remain undestroyed. If it were true I would certainly become a Christian and worship Christ and believe in Mary."" Thus he meditated many days. And one day, as he was standing before her, suddenly he saw on the picture two streams of liquid running down like oil and meron from the breasts of the picture. And when he saw this miracle he fell down upon the earth before the picture of our Lady Mary, and he said, ""I believe in the Christian Faith. If meron and oil can flow from wood, God can assuredly do what is greater than this in the flesh of man.""

Fol. 88b, No. 70.] THERE was a certain king who dwelt by the sea, and he had only one son, a youth goodly, and blessed, and God-fearing. And his father, by reason of his great love for him, brought teachers to instruct him in learning of every kind, and how to direct his kingdom when he grew up, and his father set him in the church that was in his house. And the youth prayed continually to our Lady Mary, for he loved her with all his heart. Now there was a picture of our Lady Mary in the church, and the youth loved that picture, and when he had dismissed his teacher he would stand before it and salute her. And one day as he stood before the picture our Lady Mary spake unto him, and said unto him, ""O my beloved, believe in me. I have rejoiced in thy work, and I love thee exceedingly because thou hast loved me."" And when the youth heard the words of the picture he marvelled greatly and was sore afraid. And she said unto him, ""Be not afraid, for I hold con verse in the picture with those whom I love."" And the youth said unto her, ""As to thy loving me—I have spoken unto thee on many days, and thou hast not answered me."" And she said unto him, ""Now, how much dost thou love me?"" And he said unto her, ""I love thee more than my father, and my mother, and myself."" And she said unto him, ""I know that thou dost not love me with sincerity. I wish thee to take no wife except a woman who hath my likeness and form; be hold now, observe me well, so that thou mayest know what I am like."" And when the youth looked at the picture he was unable to gaze his fill at her because of the great beauty of her form and the radiance that came forth from her. And she said unto him, ""Give me thy hand [and swear] that thou wilt marry no woman except myself, for I am a jealous woman, and I am jealous about thee."" And the youth rose up and went to her, and he gave her his hand, and she gave him her hand, and he took it and kissed it twice; and because of his joy he wept. And she said unto him, ""Keep thy virginity, for he who keepeth his virginity becometh my brother, and no man in this world is able to describe his felicity. Henceforth I shall not hold converse with thee again until I come and take thee with me into the kingdom of heaven, where thou shalt be with me in everlasting joy."" And when his teacher came he saw the traces of tears on his face, and brought him out of the church. And when his father saw that he loved to sit in the church, and that he had no desire to dress and adorn himself like the children of kings and to make merry with them, he said, ""If I allow my son to indulge in this habit he will become despised among the children of the Christians and kings. I wish to obtain a wife for him, so that his eyes may be opened, and so that he may become like the other children of men; for a wife improveth a man in very many matters."" And his father obtained for him from a distant part of the country a beautiful maiden who was like unto the light of the sun, and brought her unto him. And when he had brought her to his house there gathered together in the church all the nobles and all the horsemen, and the bishop came to crown them. And the young man hid himself, and they only found him with the greatest difficulty, and they brought him sorrowing to his father. And his father rebuked him and said unto him, before the bishop, ""My son, dost thou not want this woman?"" And the young man said, ""No, I do not."" And the bishop said unto him, ""Urge him not, for he shameth his wife."" And the young man was looking out for a hiding-place, to which he might flee from them, and his father said, ""Hold him fast."" And as he fled he fell down and his neck was broken, and their joy was turned to weeping and sorrow. And as they were bearing the young man along and weeping they heard a loud and terrifying and majestic voice, and they lifted up their eyes to heaven and they saw a crowd of angels coming down to the young man. And among them was a glorious Lady of most beautiful form and appearance, and light shone from her face, and there was none able to describe (?) her. And she blessed him and said unto him, ""Behold, I have come unto thee, O my beloved, so that I may take thee with me into joy, even as I promised thee; give me thy soul."" And the young man fell asleep and delivered up his soul to her, and they heard a voice that rejoiced, and they smelled a perfume that was sweeter than any scent in the world.

And one day he went out from the city, and he had a friend with him, for the district was too strait for him. And as he was going along the young man remembered the exalted position and the pleasure which he had enjoyed, and then he thought of his want and misery. And he said unto his friend, ""My friend, God knoweth how much I wish that my soul would depart so that I might escape from the censoriousness of men."" And his friend said unto him, ""If thou wishest thou canst be superior to all the men of this city. I will take thee to my friend Satan; do everything that he telleth thee and he will help thee""; and the young man said, ""I will do everything he telleth me."" Then his .friend leaped upon his horse and disappeared from him, and he cried out to Satan, who appeared unto him, and he said unto him, ""Behold, I have brought unto thee another slave; keep back from him nothing that he requireth."" And Satan came to the young man in the form of a man, and said unto him, ""If thou wilt, thou shalt be my servant; swear to me that thou wilt do all I wish."" And the young man said unto him, ""I will do everything thou wishest."" And Satan said unto him, ""I wish thee to deny Christ, and the Father, and the Holy Ghost""; and the young man said, ""I will do so."" And again Satan said, ""Deny the angels""; and the young man said, ""I will do so."" And again Satan said unto him, ""And deny Mary."" And when the young man heard the mention of our Lady Mary he feared with a great fear, and said, ""God forbid that I should do this thing; if thou didst give me everything in the world I would not deny her."" And Satan said unto him, ""If thou wilt not hearken unto my voice I will take my money and depart from thee""; and Satan snatched away his friend, and they went down alive together into Sheol. And when the young man saw this great punishment he feared greatly, and he wept bitterly and went to a church that was near him, and he got down from his horse, and tied the beast to the door, and went into the church. And he found therein a picture of our Lady Mary with her Son, and he stood up before it, and he lifted up his eyes to it with weeping and lamentation. And after the young man had gone into the church, a certain very rich man came in, and he hid behind a pillar, and prayed, and made supplication to God for his soul, and he watched what the young man was doing. And shedding tears abundantly he said, ""O my Lady Mary, thou knowest that I have remembered thee and made thee an asylum at the time of my trouble, I beseech thee to be to me a mediatrix with thy darling Son, for thou art the mother of mercy, and the hope of sinners like myself""; and through his excessive weeping he fell asleep. And our Lady Mary cried out to her Son and said, O my Son, I entreat Thee to forgive this young man the sin that he hath committed."" And her Son said unto her, ""O My mother, must I do everything that thou askest Me F [If so], how will he be punished? I will not forgive him."" And when our Lady Mary heard the word of her Son she said, ""If Thou wilt not forgive him I will never again carry Thee in my arms, and I will never hold Thee in my bosom""; and she set Him down out of her arms upon the altar. And our Lord smiled and said unto her, ""Take Me up, for behold, I have forgiven him his sin""; and straightway she lifted Him up into her bosom. Now the young man had fallen upon the ground, and because of his excessive weeping had gone to sleep. And our Lady Mary called out to the rich man and said unto him, ""Hearken unto what I shall say unto thee""; and he said, ""I will hearken."" And she said unto him, ""Accept this usury for thyself (or, thy soul). Take this young man, get a wife for him, and establish him in thy house, so that thou mayest rejoice greatly.""

And a certain rich knight came to that city, and he was of noble family, and of goodly appearance, and he was altogether lovable; and as soon as he saw that woman his heart was transfixed with the love of her. But he did not show this openly and he told no one of it, but he shewed himself friendly unto those who were her inti mate friends, and he made presents to her husband, and he yielded to his wishes, and showed him great affection, and did the things that pleased him, and he often invited him to his table, and he gave him [rich] apparel, and some of his horses. And when the knight knew that the heart of the woman's husband was turned to him, he said unto him one day in a joking manner, ""O my beloved, I wish that I and thou and thy lady wife might eat together, and I wish her to set me in her heart, just as thou thyself hast done in thy affection for me."" And the husband said, ""I agree, for my house is thy house, and we are thy servants""; and he invited the knight to his house and made ready much meat and drink, and he commanded his wife to treat him with honour. And the knight, taking with him for the wife a splendid gift of very great value, went to her, and she welcomed him with a joyful face, and with a gracious mind, and she embraced him and seated him next to her. And the knight presented to her the gift that he had brought, and she rejoiced in his gift and thanked him for his gracious kindness. And after they had eaten [the husband] rose up and departed, and the knight and the wife were left alone together. And he said unto her, ""I am dying of love for thee,"" and he told her that he would give her many gifts and everything that she could wish for with her mouth. And when the wife heard his words, she became furiously angry, and said unto him, ""Thou shalt never do such a thing as this, and it shall never happen, even if thou wert to give me everything there is in the world."" And the knight rose up and de parted sad and sorrowful in heart; but he did not cease to visit her, and he continued to give her gifts, and he persisted with her until she came to love him and agreed to do what he wished. And she made a plan with him to go out to him from her house after all the household had gone to sleep. And she went out at the time he appointed, according as they had arranged, and she could not find him, because he lived at a great distance from that place. And when she failed to find him she became angry and went back to her house; and then she meditated and said, ""I will go out again and peradventure I shall find him""; and she went out. And at the time of her going out she found a book wherein were written the Hours of our Lady Mary, and she took it in her hand and she held it in the light of the moon. And when she arrived at the place they had agreed upon she began the recital of the prayer for the dead, and the man was watching her. And when he wanted to go to her he saw many dead people, and he was afraid, and he stood still in the place where he was. And when the woman had finished the prayer for the dead she began the recital of the prayer of our Lady Mary, and the dead people disappeared. And the man saw a multitude of virgins like stars coming down from heaven, and among them was our Lady Mary who was shining more brightly than the sun and moon, and upon her head was a crown of glory set with gems of great beauty, and none could look upon her by reason of the great splendour that was upon her. And the knight threw himself upon his face when he saw this. And he looked again, and behold, he saw the virgins placing a throne which shone like lightning, and our Lady Mary sat thereon, and they lighted two lamps, and set them one on her right hand and one on her left. And our Lady Mary was watching the woman and wondering how she could pray, and when she was finishing her reading and was coming to the end of her prayer, all the virgins who were with our Lady prayed with the woman. And having finished the prayer, she rose up, and our Lady Mary went up into heaven with great glory, and the woman remained there by herself. And the knight came to her and bowed low at her feet, and said unto her, ""O woman, blessed art thou; pray thou to God for me, for I have seen a most marvellous and astonishing sight""; and he told her how he had seen the dead people and our Lady Mary. And he said unto her, ""Pray thou for me. As for me I wish to serve this Lady all the days of my life""; and he kissed and embraced the woman, and left her, and departed. And the woman returned to her house terrified and trembling because of what she had seen. And the knight sold all his possessions and gave [the price thereof] to the poor, and he assumed the garb of the ascetic life, and died in peace. And the husband of the woman died, and two months afterwards she also sold all her possessions, and built a monastery, and established monks therein; and she served God for a space of twenty years, and then she died and entered into the kingdom of heaven through the prayer of our Lady Mary.

Now, he loved our Lady Mary, and paid honour to her and commemorated her, and worshipped her, and gave alms in her name. And when he died the devils came and said, ""He is ours because he lived on the fruits of oppression."" And the angels came and said, ""He is ours,"" and they showed [them] a list of the good deeds which he had done that they had with them.

And then came the mother of the Sun, the compassionate one, the hope of sinners, the light of the living, the bride of the resurrection, our Lady Mary, and she said unto them, ""Let go this man, for he used to serve me in this world so that I might help him in the world which is to come.""

And that Jew went into a church [with his friend] according to his wont, and he turned round and saw in a niche a picture of our Lady Mary, which was painted on a tablet. And he said unto his friend, ""O my friend, I adjure thee to tell me whose picture is this on the wood."" And the Christian said unto him, ""This is a picture of our Lady Mary, the boast of virgins, pure and radiant and excellent, the crown of the daughters of Eve, the adornment of the children of Adam, the mother of mercy, the light of believers, the mother of our God Jesus Christ, the Son of God, Who shall judge the living and the dead."" And when the Jew heard this he became furiously angry, and he said unto the Christian, ""Art thou not ashamed to mention the name of one who is detested among us?"" And in his exceedingly great wrath he rose up from his place, and took the picture and threw it down into the latrine. And at that moment a devil seized him, and tore his tongue out of his mouth, and the Enemy snatched him away and put him in Sheol. And when the Christian saw what had happened to the Jew, he was greatly afraid; and he went down into the latrine, and picked up the picture, and washed it and cleansed it, and scented it and censed it, and set it in a clean place, and lighted a lamp before it. And pure oil used to run out of that picture, and everyone who anointed himself therewith was healed [of his sickness] by the command of God and by the prayer of our Lady Mary, the worker of signs and wonders.

Fol. 96b, No. 75.] THERE was a certain nobleman in the city of Rome, and his wife was a noble lady, and they were rich. Now they had no children and, because of their passionate desire for children, they gave alms and made offerings to the martyrs and saints, and they loved our Lady Mary with all their hearts, and they served her with all their might. And God heard their petition and accepted their prayer, and gave them a man child; and they rejoiced with a great joy. And because of his exceedingly great love for the boy his father wished to save up a hoard for him, so that no stranger might hope for his money, and he diminished his alms, and prized his money, and ceased to do the kind acts which he had done formerly. And after a few days he pondered in his mind, saying, ""Woe is me! I am a beggar because of this boy, I have ceased to do good. It is best for me to forsake the world and all that therein is, and to go and save my soul."" And he left his wife and child and went and became a monk in a certain monastery. Now the mother of the boy, because of her great love for him, never allowed him to sleep except with her. And when the boy grew up and arrived at man's estate, he learned to know women carnally, and he destroyed his virginity. And one night whilst he was lying on a couch with his mother, and they both were conversing with words of sin and joking together, Satan set the shameful thing between them, and seduced them, and at length the son committed fornication with his mother and she conceived. And she was afraid lest the neighbours should have knowledge of her act, and she concealed her conception, and she multiplied her alms, and served our Lady Mary, and looked to her to protect her. And when she brought forth her child she threw it away, and no one knew of it. And when Satan saw her act he wished to expose her because of what she had done, and to disgrace her. And he appeared in the form of a wise man (magician?), who foretold what was going to happen before it took place; and he used to overcome everyone who attempted to engage in a dispute with Satan. And his fame was noised abroad in the city of Rome, and the rumour of him reached the king, who summoned him and made him his counsellor. And one day he said unto the king, ""I am marvelling at the sin of a certain woman who dwelleth in this city""; and he told him how she had conceived by her son, and how she had hidden her conception, and how she had cast away her child in her house. And when the king heard this story he was wroth, and he said unto him, ""If this which thou tellest me be true I will do unto her according as thou shalt command; and if it be not true I will curse thee and punish thee and all who are like unto thee."" And Satan said unto him, ""I am well pleased with all thou hast said unto me."" And the king sent for the woman, and when she came before him he told her everything that she had done; and when she heard she was afraid, but the Holy Spirit made her strong because of the beauty of her works. And she said unto him, ""My lord, give me counsel""; and she received an appointment for the third day. And when she came forth from the presence of the king, she went to the bishop and confessed her sin, and he said unto her, ""Fear thou not, O my daughter, and be not sad, but receive thou everything that hath come unto thee with thanks giving, and it shall be unto thee for repentance, and thy reward shall not be blotted out before God."" And when the appointed day came she went into the presence of the king, and she rejoiced and was glad because of the salvation of her soul. And when she arrived the king said unto Satan, ""Here is the woman""; and Satan was afraid of her and said, ""This is not the woman who committed this sin,"" and he saw by her side another woman whom he could not look upon because of the brightness of her face. And Satan commanded the people to light a large fire, and the fire was smoky and covered the light of the sun. And all the people of Rome gathered together, and that woman began to speak with joy and gladness, even as the Holy Spirit made her to speak. And when Satan heard he melted away like smoke, and [though] they searched for him they found him not. Thereupon they knew that the affair was the work of Satan and that it was caused by his jealousy of the deeds which the woman had been wont to do. And all this took place through the petition of our Lady Mary. Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933. One Hundred and Ten Miracles of Our Lady Mary, pp. 244-246. London: Oxford University Press, H.

Mus. MS. Orient. No. 652. Fol. 99b, No. 77.] THERE was in a certain city a church which the people wanted to [re]build, and they placed at the door an image of our Lady Mary, so that all who passed through the door might, through the agency of the picture, give alms for the work of [re]building. And before the church there was a fine open space where the youths and maidens used to gather together to enjoy themselves. And one day the deacons and other folic gathered together to enjoy themselves, and among them was the son of the deacon, and he was a very handsome youth. And he loved a certain girl who was a virgin, and she loved him, and because of the greatness of her love for him she gave him her ring, and said unto him, ""Keep this ring so that thou mayest remember me."" And he said unto her, ""I will never love another woman ""; and the ring remained with the young man, and he loved it like his own soul because of the love of that maiden. And when he was enjoying himself with the young folk he was afraid of breaking the ring, and he wanted to hand it over for safe keeping to a friend. And turning round he saw the image of our Lady Mary before the door of the church, and he went up to it and said unto it, ""Verily I say unto thee that thou art more beautiful than the woman I love, and henceforward thou shalt be my love. And this ring shall be a re minder from me that thou art my love, and I desire no other woman besides thee."" And he went and placed the ring on her finger, and the hand of the image grasped it tightly. And when the young man saw this miracle, he called the young folk to him and said, ""Come ye and see this miracle""; and he told them everything that had taken place in connection with the ring. And the men of understanding said unto him, ""Our Lady Mary wisheth thee to be her servant all the days of thy life."" But the young man would not accept their words, and he went out from their midst, and forgot the ring and the covenant. Now he belonged to a noble family. And when he had grown up [his kinsfolk] brought to him the woman whom he had loved and who loved him. And after they had gone into their bed, the young man slept a little, and our Lady Mary appeared unto him in a dream, and rebuked him, and said unto him, ""O false one, O perjured one, where is the covenant which thou didst make with me? Behold, hast thou taken a woman who is better than I am? And hast thou loved a woman who is more noble than myself? Behold, thy ring is on my finger, and I say unto thee that if thou takest another woman I will regard thy word as a lie and will take vengeance on thee."" And she appeared unto the young man as if she were a spectre between him and his wife, and he woke up in fear and trembling, and it seemed to him as though the image [of our Lady Mary] was between him and his wife, and he was groping about that peradventure he might be able to touch her. And as he meditated upon the dream that he had seen he quickly fell asleep. And again he saw in a dream the image of our Lady Mary, and she was filled with wrath against him, and she said unto him, ""If thou dost falsify thy word to me I will punish thee in this world and in the next; consider now what thou wilt do."" And then she disappeared from him. And he awoke from his dream in fear and trembling, and he meditated, saying, ""I am not a child, nor am I without understanding. In truth I did talk with Mary and say that I would be her servant, and she is seeking what is hers, and my ring is held fast by her, and I did covenant with her to serve her."" And he rose up quickly from his bed and put on his apparel, and he went out from his bridal chamber without anyone recognizing him. And he forsook his bride, and abandoned all his possessions in the world, and departed into the desert and embraced the ascetic life; and he dwelt as a solitary and served our Lady Mary. And she helped him in respect of his food and apparel, until he died and departed from this world and entered into unending life through the prayer of our Lady Mary, the worker of miracles. Budge, E.

And in his great wrath he went into a church that was near him, and seeing there a picture of our Lady Mary with our Lord Jesus in her lap, he unsheathed his large knife and slashed the figures of our Lady and her Son, and then he took it and threw it down a deep well (or, pit). And as he turned round, his apparel being smeared with blood, he met a certain Christian who said unto him, ""O accursed man, whom hast thou killed this day? Was it a righteous man?"" And the Jew denied it, and the Christian said unto him, ""Verily thou hast killed a righteous man, and human blood is on thine apparel, and the injury of God is upon thee and upon thy face."" And God put fear into the heart of the Jew, and he said, ""I have not killed a man but only gashed a picture."" And when the Christian heard his words, he seized him by the neck and dragged him to the magistrate, who asked him where he had thrown the picture, saying, ""Where hast thou thrown it?"" And the Jew replied, ""In such-and-such a well."" And men went with him, and they brought the picture up out of the well dripping with the blood that was running from the wounds of our Lady and her Son.

And this monk loved a woman who lived on the other side of the river, and one night he went forth from the monastery at midnight to visit that woman, and as he was going along he said the prayer of our Lady Mary. And as soon as he entered the river, devils seized him and threw him down into the water, and he was choked and died. And the devils hovered about and surrounded his body so that they might carry off his soul, but the angels helped him and delivered it from them; and the devils said, ""His soul belongeth to us, for it hath done evil."" And our Lady Mary came and said unto them, ""O ye cursed and evil ones, let go my servant""; but the devils said, ""It is ours, for we caught him in sin."" And our Lady Mary said unto them, ""He was in my service, and ye kept him back from my service; if ye refuse I will summon you before Christ my Son.""

Fol. 81a, 1; B. Fol. 60b, 1.] O MY brethren, ye Christian people, we will relate unto you this great miracle and wonderful deed that our holy Lady, Mary the twofold Virgin, the God-bearer, wrought in the city of Athribis. There was a certain king whose title was ""Kalifa"" (i.e. Khalifah), and he reigned after his father Rashid— now the meaning of this title is ""cruel"" (or, savage), and before he had received the kingdom he set himself in opposition to the Christians, and persecuted them, and made violent attacks upon the churches. And his disposition towards them was like unto that of Paul before his conversion to the faith of Jesus Christ, when he was of the Jewish faith. Now this king chose a certain man from among his soldiers, and having appointed him general over one hundred horsemen, he com manded him to journey through all the cities and provinces of the country of Egypt, and to go round about in all the borders thereof, and to pull down and destroy the churches, and everything that was therein. And this man came unto the city of Athribis, that is to say, to that portion of the boundary of its territory that is opposite to the village wherein they make honey. Now there was in the city an exceedingly large church, which had been built in the name of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-bearer. And in the church there were four doors, and in these four doors were four shrines, and above the four shrines were four canopies, which were supported by one hundred and sixty pillars, all of which were hewn out of white stone, and between each pillar was a distance of forty cubits. Each pillar was carved all over with vine branches, and the hollow (or, capitals) of them were sculptured and ornamented with cunning work in stone, and they were encircled with bands of gold and silver. And there were in the church four and twenty saints' chapels, and in them were placed four and twenty Tabernacles of the Law (i.e. the arks that contained the Eucharistic Elements). And in one of these chapels was an image of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-bearer, which was sculptured and inlaid with mother-of-pearl, and this image was apparelled in a garment that was made of the purple of Constantinople. And near the image of the Virgin Mary were sculptured the figures of two angels (i.e. Michael and Gabriel) which stood one on each side of it. And the lamps that were hanging before the image were made of gold and silver, and they ceased not to burn by day and by night, and [the servants of the church] kept them supplied and filled with oil. Now there lived in that church a certain monk who was the chief priest, and his name was John. He was a virgin, and a righteous man, and he kept diligently the laws of the church in respect of the seasons for prayer, and for the consecration of the Eucharist, both by day and by night, without ceasing. And God was well-pleased with him by reason of the beauty of his righteousness, and his gentleness, and his humility. But let us return to the beginning of our story: When the general of the king's host had arrived at the church, he took up his abode on the bank of the Nile, and they pitched his tents there so that he might rest a few days. And the people of the city were greatly disturbed because they heard that the general had come to pull down the church, and to destroy the fair beauty of the building which had been built in the name of our holy Lady, Mary, the twofold Virgin, the God-bearer, and that he was about to make an end of the words of the priests thereof who used to proclaim the true faith therein. And the people informed the holy man John concerning this thing, and when he heard it he became sad and exceedingly sorrowful. Then he girded up his loins in the strength of the Holy Spirit Who dwelt in him; and he rose up and prayed unto God in bitterness of heart. And after he had made an end of his prayer and of the supplication which he offered up with much crying, he left his house and departed unto the place where the general was sitting in his tent. And when the servants of the general saw him they said unto the holy man John, ""Why hast thou come here, O monk, and what dost thou desire?"" And John answered and said unto them, ""Behold, I have the wish that ye should announce me quickly to the general, for there is a word that I would speak with him, and it must be spoken between us two in private""; so the servants departed and made known to the general concerning him, and he made them bring John into his presence. Then John gave him the salutation of ""Peace,"" with modesty and humility of spirit. And the general welcomed him, and said unto him, ""And to thee also be peace with the mercy of God."" And again the general said unto him, ""O monk, hast thou the de sire to seek ought from me?"" Then John the monk said unto him, ""Yea, my lord. I wish thee to take me unto some place where there is no man except thyself, so that I may speak unto thee in private the word that I have to say."" And the general commanded those who were round about him to withdraw, and there remained no one [with them] except the friend who was the general's chief counsellor, and who lay in his bosom. Then the general said unto him, ""O monk, declare what thy heart desireth."" And John said unto him, ""O my lord and master, behold now I have heard that thou hast come hither to pull down the church, and to destroy the fair beauty of the edifice thereof, which hath been built in the name of our holy Lady, Mary, the twofold Virgin, the God-bearer, the church that is the oldest and fairest of all the churches [of Egypt]. And behold, I entreat God, and I make supplication unto thee also that thou wilt come and walk about a little in the courtyard and in the broad aisles of the church, so that thou mayest be able to see the building thereof, and its foundations, and the pavement of the courtyard, and the boundary of its walls, and the roof of the building that is over the shrines, and its pillars and its vaulted roofs, which are inlaid with gold and silver and shining mother-of-pearl. Come now, that thou mayest look upon the church before the order for the destruction thereof goeth forth from thy mouth."" Then he who was the chief counsellor and friend of the general said unto him, ""O Master, the words of this old man have weight, and to them attacheth a meaning; it will do thee no harm to look upon the church; on the contrary, it will do thee good. Rise up, then, that thou mayest see the church—for the way [thither] is short—even though the beauty of the building may not please thee."" And it came to pass that when the general had heard what his chief counsellor, who lay in his bosom, said unto him, he rose up quickly and walked round about through the courts and colonnades of the church with a doubtful mind, whilst the old man John waited upon him in the path. And when the general and his counsellor had come into the church, and had looked about it, they marvelled at the beauty of its disposition and arrangement, and at the dignity of each and all of its splendid adornments, and at its venerable appearance, and at its doors. Then the general said unto John, ""O monk, how exceedingly beautiful is this church! The lowermost structure is pleasing, and the building itself is magnificent and of most marvellous beauty. But what shall we say concerning it? For the King Khalifah hath commanded us to pull down the churches and to overthrow the houses of idols, and for this reason we dare not transgress by the least jot or tittle the words of his command."" And the old man John answered and said unto the general in a humble voice, ""Master, thy word is true. But I pray thee to hearken unto the words that I would speak before thee, for the things that I wish to say unto thee are good and not evil."" Then the general said unto him, ""What are the good words that thou couldst speak that would please me? But speak, I pray thee."" And the old man John said unto him, ""O my lord, grant me a boon, and wait patiently for three days before thou destroyest this church—now for each day of the delay I will pay thee one hundred dinars—until a letter with commands from the king shall reach thee; and after the three days are ended then shall it be as God Almighty willeth. And if a letter with commands reach thee [good and well]; and if not, then do as thou wishest."" Now when the general, together with his friend and counsellor, had heard these words from John the priest, he laughed at him, and derided him, and said unto him, ""O aged man, between us and the country of Mace donia is it not a journey that would require a space of two months to perform by those who would travel thither? And to return hither would also require two months, that is to say, added together the number of the months is four, and yet thou sayest unto me, Wait patiently for three days until a letter with commands from the king shall reach thee."" And the counsellor said unto the general,"" These Christians grow old and their brains dry up in the years of their old age, and their understanding groweth gradually less, and they become stupid through praying and fasting overmuch; and they destroy their intellect with food made of gar den herbs, and lentils and pulse. But now I will give thee counsel that shall be pleasing unto thee: Take from this old man the three hundred dinars, for they will pay that which thou owest; a letter with commands from the king cannot reach thee in three days, and after that period thou canst do as thou wishest."" Then straightway the general said unto the blessed old man, ""I consent, and I will wait patiently for thee until three days are ended, and in accordance with what thou sayest I will not pull down the church."" And John the priest said unto him, ""Now therefore, establish a covenant with me, and swear an oath before our holy Lady, Mary the twofold Virgin, the God-bearer, that thou wilt not change these thy words, and that thou wilt not deceive me."" Then they made a covenant together, and they established an agreement, and the general took an oath before God at the shrine of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary. And straightway the governor went forth from the church with his counsellor, and he tarried in the place where he was living for three days; and the general and the counsellor to gether derided the blessed old man, and they laughed his folly to scorn. Then John the priest said unto his companions, ""Shut ye fast the doors of the church upon me, and bolt them with the bolts thereof, so that none of you may be able to draw nigh unto me and to visit me for three days and three nights."" And having said these words he went into the sanctuary of the church, and stood up before the image of our holy Lady, Mary the twofold Virgin, the God-bearer. And his mind was carried away into heaven, and he began to pray with exceedingly great watchfulness, and he made abundant supplication with discretion and understanding. He wept with a bitter weeping, and scalding tears flowed from his eyes and covered his cheeks. And he bathed himself in the flood of tears that rolled down from his weeping upon the place where his holy feet stood; and he grieved and mourned with sore lamentation lest he should see the destruction of the church. Then, as he stood up before the image of our Lady, he said, ""O my holy Lady, Mary, thou twofold Virgin, the God-bearer, who deliverest those who commit themselves unto thee, who receivest into thy safe keeping those who flee unto thee for refuge, O my Lady, thou Queen of heaven and earth, behold, the time hath arrived for thee to pray and to make supplication unto thy beloved Son, our Lord and Redeemer, Jesus Christ. O my Lady, He Who was brought forth by thee is holy, and He is called the Son of God the Most High, and the Lord God hath given unto Him the throne of David His father. He shall rule the house of Jacob for ever, and His kingdom shall have no end, and He shall perform for thee every thing that thou shalt ask from Him. Now hath the time drawn nigh for the manifestation of thy power over thine enemies who wish to overthrow Thy holy place. Arise, do battle with thine enemies and let them not escape; destroy thou their counsel, and let them not say, 'Ha, ha, we have seen with our eyes the dis grace, and the destruction, and the misery of the place' wherein thou dwellest. O my Lady, I entreat thee and I adjure thee by the Holy Word Whom thou didst carry for nine months and five days—that is, until the time when He was brought forth by thee—and Whom thou didst suckle at thy breast; and I entreat thee and I ad jure thee by God, His Father, not to punish always, and not to be angry forever, O thou who art tender of heart and whose mercies towards the children of men are abundant. And I entreat thee and I adjure thee by thy prayer which is received before the eyes of thy Son, to make manifest this day the might of thy miraculous power, O my Lady, thou Lady of angels and of men."" With these words and with others like unto them did John make supplication, and he wept by day and by night, and he ceased not to watch, and to pray, and to prostrate himself before her with words and deeds of service; and he neither ate nor drank, and he tasted no food with his lips until the end of the three days. And it came to pass that, behold on the third day, at the eleventh hour of the night, after cockcrow but before the daylight had come, our Lady, Mary the twofold Virgin, who gave birth to God, and who is tender of heart unto those who make supplication unto her with abundance of tears and with a broken spirit, appeared unto him in visible form from out of her image, and she poured forth from her lips grace upon John. And she said unto him, ""O priest John, behold God hath received all thy petition that thou hast made unto Him concerning the destruction of the house of my sanctuary, and from this time forward thou shalt not be sorrowful, neither shall thy soul weary itself with toil. For this night I have commanded the King Khalifah to write a letter and to send it to this general [commanding him] not to overthrow the house of my sanctuary. And behold, the letter that containeth these commands shall arrive quickly from Macedonia, yea, it shall come in this same hour, as it were in the twinkling of an eye; and it is written with his own hand and beareth his own words ordering the general neither to plunder nor to pull down this church. And now, fear not, and let not thine heart be dismayed, but be strong in the strength of God, and cease thou to afflict thyself grievously, and weary not thy soul with toil, for no man hath power over the house of my sanctuary. For the Father of my beloved Son is the pillar thereof, and my Only Son is the ground upon which it standeth, and the Holy Spirit is the foundation and base thereof."" And having said these words and given him the salutation of peace she disappeared from him. Now when the priest John heard the gracious words and the utterances of the mouth of our holy Lady, Mary the twofold Virgin, the God-bearer, at that moment, I say, the gracious gift of joy and gladness came upon him, and he exulted and found rest through the Holy Spirit. And he put on strength and bowed down before the image of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-bearer, and he sang praises unto her name with sweet songs. See now, O my beloved breth ren, how exceedingly mighty was the prayer of this good, and pure, and righteous man! It was even as the Apostle said, ""The prayer of the righteous man hath power, ""I and it giveth help and maketh a man to have dominion. Meanwhile the general was lying upon his bed fast asleep in his tent, and his tent was firmly closed and a lamp was burning by his side. And at the very moment [i.e. when Mary was talking to John], he awoke from his sleep, and saw there by the light of the lamp a white dove which had dropped a sealed letter from his beak. Then, marvelling greatly at this thing, he enquired of his servant and said unto him, ""Whence did he come? And how did this white dove enter the tent, seeing that it is firmly closed and that the wings thereof are fastened with pegs?"" And his servant said unto him, ""I know neither whence he hath come, nor by what means he hath entered the tent, but only that I saw him drop a sealed letter from his beak, and that the letter was sealed with the seal of the king."" Then straightway the white dove vanished before their eyes. And the general said, ""Behold, my soul is moved, and my heart is confused by reason of this thing."" And he rose up quickly and took the letter in his hand, and he opened it and read it by the light of the lamp; and he found that the letter was in the handwriting of the king himself, and that the ink wherewith the king's own words had been written was wet, as though they had just been written. And the letter spake thus: ""Letter from the King Khalif ah unto the general in command of one hundred soldiers mounted on horses, whom I commanded to go and travel round about through the borders of Egypt, and to overthrow the churches of the Christians. Know now, and understand, O general, concerning the people whom God, the Most High, loveth, for thou shalt do no harm either unto them or unto the church that is in the city of Athribis, or unto the [other] churches that are within the borders of Egypt. But when thou hast read this letter, which containeth mine own words and is written by mine own hand, thou shalt rise up straight way, and quickly and in all haste thou shalt come unto me. Furthermore, as concerning the church in the city of Athribis which hath been built in the name of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-bearer, I desire that it shall not be harmed, or destroyed, or desecrated in any way whatsoever. Behold, I have written this letter at the eleventh hour of the night, and in testimony thereof I set my seal."" And thereafter followed the seal that the king had set to the letter, and was understood between him and the general. And it came to pass that when the general had seen and read the letter he marvelled exceedingly, and he found the matter very hard to understand; and fear and trembling laid hold upon him. Then he said unto his chief counsellor, ""Take with thee four young men and go and bring hither quickly the old man the monk, who was in the church."" And the young men went quickly and searched for him with much toil, and they found him in the church praying; and they took him and brought him to the general. And when the general saw him afar off, he went forth to meet him with a bright, and glad, and joyful countenance, and he said unto him, ""O servant of God, sit thou down, and tell me where thou hast been from the day we parted until this day."" Then John the priest said unto him, ""I remained in the church praying unto God Almighty that He would look upon my lowly estate, and that He would not let me see the destruction of the church. And at a certain time our Lady, who is in the image, appeared unto me, and she told me how a letter had come unto thee which contained the royal commands, bidding thee to desist from the attempt to destroy the church. Then straightway I ascribed praise unto God Almighty, the Most High, Who is to be praised, and I gave thanks unto the holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, for the deliverance of the church from destruction."" And the governor said unto him, ""Yea, what thou hast said is true, and thy words are right. Behold, a letter containing the royal commands of my lord the king hath just reached me from the beak of a white dove. But I cannot understand by what means the dove that dropped into my tent from his beak the letter containing the royal commands of my lord the king, written by his own hand, hath reached me. And the king hath commanded me to desist from the attempt to destroy the church, and to go [back] to him. And now, O priest, I know the intercession of our Lady Mary, and the power of her help, and that her Son doeth for her everything that she asketh Him [to do], therefore rise up, and let us go to the church, and let us pray before the image of our holy Lady, Mary the twofold Virgin, that she will help me and make prosperous my way."" Then straightway they rose up and went together to the church, and John the priest prayed a prayer that was fitting, and the general himself prayed unto our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary. And he gave unto the church one hundred dinars, and the three hundred dinars of gold, concerning which he made three days before a covenant that John the priest should give him, he re mitted unto him. Then the general bade John the priest farewell, and departed from him in peace; and he set out on his journey to Macedonia, giving thanks unto God Almighty, and marvelling at the wonderful and miraculous thing that he had seen. And it came to pass that at the end of two months the general arrived in the country of Macedonia, and when he entered into the presence of the king he saluted him; and he and his soldiers bowed down before him; and the king was exceedingly glad to see him, and he gave him the salutation of peace. Then the king made those who were standing about him to withdraw, and he said unto the general, ""Did the letter containing my royal commands which I sent unto thee in the beak of a white dove reach thee?"" And the general said unto him, ""Yea, it reached me in the night, just before daybreak, and I have come, even as thou didst com mand me to come, and here is the letter with me now ""; and he shewed the letter unto the king. Then the king marvelled and said unto him, ""Is this thing indeed true?"" And the general said unto him, ""O my lord, I swear unto thee by the Living God that this great mystery, which hath never been imagined in the heart of man, hath been made manifest unto me. Tell me by what means thou didst send it unto me, for I have never heard of a thing like unto this."" Then the king said unto him, ""Behold, I will tell thee. Three days before I wrote this letter unto thee a great and marvellous thing happened unto me. At the first hour of the night, whilst I was asleep, I saw a fire burning brightly in my palace, in the hall of my kingdom, and the light thereof illumined the whole earth. And I said unto my soul, What is this that hath happened unto me this day? And when I had come into my palace, a man who shone with light said unto me, Behold, knowest thou not that our holy Lady, Mary the twofold Virgin, the God- bearer, hath come and entered into thy palace? Rise up and do homage unto her. And again I heard a mighty noise which was greater than the roars and crashings of thunders and lightnings, and there were present beings who uttered loud cries of joy and exultation, and the sweet sounds of the singing of praises which were like unto the sound of an organ. Then there went forth from her a voice which said unto me, Who commanded thee to make thyself a foe unto the house of my sanctuary which is in the city of Athribis? And why hast thou given orders to destroy it? And I spake unto her with words of fear, saying, Forgive me this thing, O my Lady, for I have given no command to do this thing, and I have no knowledge whatsoever of the matter. And she said unto me, If thou dost not write a letter ordering that the house of my sanctuary shall not be overthrown thou shalt die an evil death. And again on the night of the following day that voice came unto me in the same manner, and spake unto me from the place where the Lady Mary was, saying, Didst thou not say unto me yesterday that thou wast not a foe unto the house of my sanctuary that is in the city of Athribis?"" And I said unto her in great trepidation, Behold, I have heard thy command, and I have received the voice of thy words, and I will write unto [my] general, even as thou hast commanded me, O my Lady. And when the morning came I again neglected to do the command of my Lady, and in the folly of my heart I forgot the vision. And on the night of the third day I saw for the third time the form and appearance [and heard] that voice, though I know not how. But it made me to get up from my bed and made me to stand upon my feet, and then a mighty dread, which tore me asunder and made all my members to tremble, fell upon me. And that voice spake once again, and said unto me, I will not have compassion upon thee in my mercy, but I will destroy thee quickly, both soul and body, and I will wipe out the memorial of thee from off the earth, because thou hast transgressed the word of my com mand. Behold, I have appeared unto thee three times in three nights, and I have told thee not to make thy self a foe unto the house of my sanctuary that is in the city of Athribis, and not to overthrow the building thereof. But now, write a letter of command, and send it quickly unto the general whom thou hast despatched to overthrow the churches; do now according to what I say unto thee."" Then I bowed low before her, and I said unto her, O my Lady, if I write a letter of command, who shall take and bring it unto the general? for the country wherein he is is afar off. And she said unto me, Do thou write according as I have commanded thee, and God Almighty will decree who shall take it to him. Then I wrote the letter straightway, with great and anxious care, for she was holding my hand. And there came unto me a white dove, and when she had drawn nigh she took the letter, which was sealed, from my hand with her beak at the eleventh hour of the night, and she departed from me and winged her flight upwards in the air; and I watched her until she disappeared from my sight. And thou didst say unto me, A white dove came unto me at the twelfth hour of the night, and dropped the letter from her beak into my tent. Our holy Lady, Mary the twofold Virgin, the God -bearer, hath wrought this hard and astonishing matter, the like of which I have neither heard of nor seen. Behold, from now and henceforth we shall understand and know well the helpfulness and greatness of her marvellous acts. From this day onwards we will abide in the hope of our holy Lady, and by the good pleasure of God, the Most High, let us persevere in the love of her, and let us study diligently to strive and to attain unto the salvation of our souls. And we will build a house in her name."" Then the king commanded them to build a church of beautiful appearance and splendid form, and they built a church nigh unto his palace; and they made the building thereof exceedingly beautiful. And the king prayed, and worshipped, and celebrated the Eucharist therein on the festivals of the commemoration of the Virgin Mary, and he caused to be painted a picture of our holy Lady, Mary the twofold Virgin, the Godbearer, whose name is sweet, the life of all the world, at the mere mention of whose name homage is fitting; and he continued to worship in the church all the days of his life. And that picture wrought many signs and wonders for him until he departed from this world and entered into the kingdom of the heavens. And all the people and the officers who were under his authority were gathered together in that church on the day of the festival of our Lady, and they paid honour unto her and loved her exceedingly; and it existeth even unto this day. A miracle of thy love, O flower of Hanna, was made known to the Khalifah. A bird, bearing a parchment letter containing royal commands, set out on its flight And at thy behest brought it unto a land afar off. Let the Fish of the sea which beareth gold Swim through the abysses and go up on the shore. Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933. One Hundred and Ten Miracles of Our Lady Mary, pp. 113-127.

Fol. 59b, 1.] NOW one day there were two women with out Lady Mary, and a thirsty dog came to them, and they drove him away; but our Lady Mary was exceedingly grieved when she saw how starved he was, and she wept. And the women said unto her, ""Wilt thou not be more merciful to the dog than we are? Shall not Christ, Who is called the Messiah, be born of thee?"" Now when our holy Lady heard these words great joy entered into her heart. Then, taking up her water pitcher, she went to a place some distance away, and having put off her shoes from her feet, she poured water into one of them and gave it to the thirsty dog to drink. And one of the women said unto her, ""Why hast thou drawn water for him with thy pitcher? If thy jar be broken thou wilt not be able to get water."" Then our Lady Mary answered and said unto her, ""The water did not come from the well but from heaven, and God, Who hath given this thirsty dog water to drink, gave it unto me from above."" Now after she had uttered these words the Word of the Father took up His abode in her. Feed thou me, O Mary, thy servant, who is held in honour [by thee] With the bread of bountiful knowledge, and with the wine of wisdom. Even though my sins be too many to be told, Remember, O my Lady, in thy gracious kindness, him that is in sore straits, Even as thou didst give the thirsty dog water to drink. Budge, E. A.

283,A Christian community is attacked by a neighboring Muslim community.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed,,LIT5251MiracleAttack,"How the Faithful Fought Back the Infidel ~ There was, in a Christian country, a dabra with a high elevation and whose top was proportionally wide. On top of it there was a church built in the name of God the Father, the creator of all creatures; and in the name of his only Son, who is glorified by the diligent, who put on the flesh of Our Lady Mary daughter of David and Solomon; and in the name of the Holy Spirit, Paraclete, who made the Prophets speak and whom the Apostles drank in the Hall of Zion. The three tabots, in their [respective] names, were there decorated with gold, silver and pearls and placed on silver altars not shaking at all, but very firm. ~ Now there lived a distance from there, on the right, left and eastern sides of that church, a multitude of infidels [=Moslems] who had wished it evil ever since it was built through many years. They gnashed [their] teeth upon it whenever they saw it with [their] eye[s]. They wanted to burn it and destroy it with iron. The priests and the deacons and all the Christians were grieved because of these infidels. The tongue of a mortal cannot count how many Christians fell by the spear while fighting in its defense. ~ Once a priest was appointed by the king to rule many countries and to protect that church. When those filthy infidels heard that a priest had been appointed, they rejoiced and broke forth into singing [instigated] by Satan saying, ""Who shall fight us now that a priest is appointed?"" They thought that God is delighted in the strength of the horse and that the Lord of the mighty will be pleased with the legs of a man. But God, the Lord of the mighty, makes the mighty fall at the hands of the weak. He can make the jubilant sorrowful and the sorrowful jubilant; whatever he pleased that did he in heaven and in earth, on seas and in the depth of seas. 16 Let us pray God, therefore, that he might protect us and guide us with his help and that we might not boast by the power of kings and rulers and by many thousands of soldiers, but keep us firm in the Orthodox faith forever. Amen. ~The Mari of the Moslems, moreover, heard from those who came from the church, from those who corrupted the religion of the Son and believed in the religion of Mohammed. They said to him, ""Come, so that we might guide you and bring you to the däbr which you wanted, where there is gold, silver and precious clothes which are impossible to count and recount."" They also said to him, ""Some of the Christians sent us [here] saying: 'Tell him to come quickly'; you should know whether they are two or three. What we told you is as they told us."" ""Would you really bring me there?"" he asked them. ""If we do not bring you there,"" they said to him, ""pierce us with your spear and take us, binding us in chains and driving us before you. If we bring you there you may decorate us. If we do not bring you there cut off our heads."" ~ The Mari of the Moslems sent one of his confidants, whom he loved dearly, with many horses which they ride, [which were] equipped with many saddle[s] that have gold, many reins of gold, many golden trappings, many golden sticks and many spears of gold and many drums called nagarit. The number of the horses which were [so] dressed were, as the spies told us, three hundred. The number of bearing horses that were unsaddled was unknown because of their abundance. The infantry, too, was, like them, countless. They came to that däbr to us, by the power of Satan, led by Satan. They besieged the däbr on all sides on the holy day of Our Lady Mary Twice Virgin. Those who guided him to the däbr, who were infidels although Christians in name, said to him, ""As for us, we have brought you here; do quickly what you wanted to do."" The arrival of those Moslems was sudden; neither the priest- ruler nor the people nor anyone in the army was informed. The ruler and all of the army heard [of it only] after the army crossed the river that was between them. The priests and the monks held prayers. ~~ A priest saw [a vision] before they started the fight. He said: I saw a woman sitting without a chair near a church beneath the outer side of the thresh hold of the door facing to the West. The woman was clothed in a white dress. Her veil spread all over the face of the whole yard of the church. A green cloth came out of her cloth and the cloth which her baby Son put on. The garment had hair on it. There was a man in front of her; she said to him, ""Come, raise me up with your hand so that you may bring me into the church."" The man was afraid to raise her up and to come close to her. She said to him, ""Come, raise me up! Be not afraid, for I am light; I am not heavy."" She held him by his hand, and so the man raised her up. That great woman entered the Church with him guided by the Child, her Son. Honorable people who looked like Egyptians received the great woman with lamps. They rejoiced in her. They all surrounded her. The number of lamps was more than one thousand. I became happy when I saw this. Waking up in happiness I thanked God and praised Our Lady Mary. I knew that that woman was our Lady Mary saviour of the whole world. ~~ He told this vision which he had seen to two men who loved him. He had seen this dream living in another country, before hearing any news, good or bad. ~ Now let us go back to our earlier story of the war. That Infidel came to the däbr and camped at the bottom of the däbr. He then wanted to ascend it; the day was the 21st of the month of Mäggabit, the holy day of Our Lady Mary Twice Virgin. The priest-ruler was on the däbr with a few of the army. The Infidel strengthened himself to ascend the däbr. But the ruler fought back the Infidel with the few of the army and became four times as strong so that the Christian army conquered him and sent him away in shame by the power of the Holy Trinity and by the prayer of Our Lady Mary Twice Virgin, Mother of God. ~ While he was fleeing, he turned around and burned down a small church built in the name of Our Lady Mary Twice Virgin. The Infidel [then] said in arrogance, calling to the Christians who were fighting him, ""Why did she not save her house, she of whom you say, 'Our Lady Mary saves us'."" (But we say, ""bowing is proper to mentioning her name for salvation."") He ran away from them in fear, turning his face towards his country. The priest-ruler followed him with the army which was with him. on the däbr . He first sent the infantry that was stinging with bows. 22 The infantry caught up with the Infidel and his army, chasing him before the priest-ruler and the cavalry arrived. The priest- ruler arrived with [his] army and gave the order to cut off their heads and strip them of their possessions. Many officers were arrested; and they cut off the head of the Infidel. They took booty, by the power of the Trinity, the boxes with their camels- the boxes which the Infidel brought loaded on camels to put in the gold and the silver which he would take from the däbr of God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit! They took as captives all that were left from the fight. They also took many clothes and tunics of silk. All this happened by the prayer of Our Lady Mary, Twice Virgin, when she beseeched the Holy Trinity and prayed to [the Trinity] for the sake of us, we the sinners. Now, too, may her prayer and blessing be with us forever. Amen. Haile, Getatchew. 1980. ""A Note on Writing History from Forgotten Documents.""

Many priests, deacons and monks lived in that country. Now, there arose a Jew from among the Christian clergy and learned the theology of the Jews. He then ·taught (it) to a small village and converted the people of that village. God smote that Christian who became a Jew. Since then that village has lived for many years with its people practising Judaism. Then a priest, who was also a monk, who had become a Jew in his heart, came to that village. He became at one with them and defiled churches with all filth. He lived blaspheming our Lord Jesus Christ and blaspheming Our Lady Mary, too. ~ One day he ate and drank with the Jewish community. The Jewish community became full with him and slept. That Jew, who was a Christian before, roared like a bull, as a bull would roar when slaughtered. The whole Jewish community awoke in a great shock and woke him up. They asked him, ""What happened to you?"" The Jew, who was a Christian before, said to them, ""Listen, that I may tell you: Jesus Christ came to me putting on the flesh of Our Lady Holy Mary, Twice Virgin, and garmented with fire and said to me: 'I am Christ! You, while a Christian priest and a monk, blasphemed me and my mother, Mary, and defiled my temple with your filth and then joined the quaternitarian and became at one with all the numerous traitors, my enemies. I, for my part, shall make seven pieces out of you by the hand of a servant of mine.' For this reason I am scared and my soul is shocked and so I roared like a bull."" When he woke up he was dizzy, without a clear mind. He told them all this when he regained consciousness. The whole Jewish community said to him, ""Are you doubting in your mind that you say all this? Do you want to be a Christian? Why did you come to us (in the first place)?"" The Jew, who was a Christian before, said to them, ""Do not say that Christ is not a king. Daniel, too, said about~: 'And there was given him dominion, and glory, and wonder, and all people and nations and tribes should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed!"" When he said this to them they murmured against him. However, they did not separate from him but lived with him according to the law of the Jews. ~One day, after his vision, God sent against him a Christian army. When the Jew, who was a Christian before, heard and saw the coming of the Christian army, he said, ""0 Jewish community, take me up to (the top of) the mountain which people cannot reach either on horse or by foot."" They took him up to a high mountain. He was pleased and said to them, ""You truly did a good thing to me. As long as I am on this mountain, nothing will really happen to me. Even if the birds of the sky become horses and the stars spears, they will not be able to come here. The feet of people and horses will not be able to come here."" soon after he said these words the Christian army arrived at the bottom of the mountain. By the power of God, they ascended the mountain of the Jews and seized that Jew, who was a Christian before. They brought him down from the mountain and brought him to the one who sent them, to the one who ruled the Christians. Their ruler was pleased and prostrated himself before God three times; and with the sword which was in his hand, he struck through his neck and completely cut (his head) off. They took him out and brought him to many churches and stood him at a distant place. There, they completed dismembering him and made of him seven pieces. They then burnt his body with fire and made him ashes and gave him to the wind, as had said earlier the Son of Mary, Our Lord Jesus Christ.

Miracle of Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary  The miracle and wonder which she worked for a wife of a ruler, by the power of her beloved Son. May her prayer be with her slave Ma'eqäbä Egzi' Amen.  There was a ruler in a great country from among the countries of the Christians. He had a wife from a family of good people. He loved her dearly. The woman lived for some time with her husband. She, however, was very sorrowful that she could not have children. She lived praying to God the highest and to Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary that she might give her a blessed son who would please her. There was also the mother of the woman whom we mentioned earlier, a good and God-fearing woman, a lover of saints and lover of Christians, of good family. She lived praying to Our Holy [f.l76r] Lady Twice Virgin Mary that she might give her/daughter a blessed and chosen child saying, "" saying, ""How long will you remain barren like God and to Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary who would fear God and please Our Holy Lady daughter answered her saying, ""Yes, I am praying; Lady Twice Virgin Mary that she would give please us and delight Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin with all good deeds. They asked Our Holy Lady she might fulfill their wish and comfort them in them.  Once the ruler, the husband of the woman whom called her and said to her, ""How long will you rogation for forty days and forty nights and ask Mary. You pray persistently; I, too, will pray Twice Virgin Mary because she is tender-hearted; prayer and give us a good son who will delight Having admonished her so, he let her go to her mother all that her husband had ordered her. When her mother heard this matter from her daughter (the idea) pleased her. They both prepared them- selves to fast and started to fast the holy fast of Lent.3W hile they were fasting for God and for Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary, the tender-hearted, before they finished the fast of Lent, three days before its end, the wife of the ruler saw a wonderful and an astounding vision while sleeping by night. The woman who saw (the vision) said:  While I was asleep in my bed, I found myself praying in a certain place. While I was praying, a certain man of light appeared to me suddenly holding a cane in his left hand and a cross of light in his right hand. He came to me and said to me, ""Peace to you, rise up egälit 4. Behold, God has heard your prayer. You shall bear a child who shall be useful to the whole [world], who will be a chosen one in the kingdom of God."" Having said this, he brought out with his right hand clean incense. Two (grains) fell down on the ground. When they fell down, I said, to the man, ""I doubt,"" and I explained to him saying, ""Of those you gave me, two fell down on the ground while I was receiving, but before I had received (them) from your hand; however, I took into my hand the one which is the best of them."" The man of light answered me again saying, ""Leave those; the best one which you took suffices you."" When he spoke like this to me, I was pleased. I took that clean incense in my hand and asked the man of light saying, ""What is your name, my lord? Who are you sent from?"" The (man) of light answered me saying, ""I am Bârtâloméwos [= Bartholomew], the Apostle of Our Lord Jesus Christ. God Our Lord sent me to you."" I asked him with pleasure, saying, ""What is this in- cense? And what is its significance?"" The (man) of light interpreted for me like this, saying, ""God sent me to you to tell you and to announce (this) to you. This is the significance of the incense: This incense which you saw, the one that is better than the other two, which you took with your hand, is a sign for the son whom God shall give you, who will be useful for the whole world.""  When I heard this annunciation from the mouth of the man of light, [f. 176r] thanked God, /who is praised through me, My Lord, and my Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary, the support of my head. She went on: ""While I was standing with the man of light, Satan came behind me. In the likeness of a beast called chamelion, he came in haste, opening his mouth, wanting to do evil to me. By the mercy of God, I turned my face to the man of light, and said to him, 'That animal wants to destroy me. O, Holy God, My Lord, help me and save me from the death of Sheol.'  Then the Apostle stirred with anger at the beast that was elated. The Apostle thrashed the beast heavily with his stick, and scattered it like burned pieces of cloth, and made him like nothing, that had never been conceived."" And now may God cover us with hi$ great compassion, and grant us entrance into the bright and shining house of his Trinity, and to me his slave, too. Amen.  When the wife of the ruler woke up from her sleep, she told her mother all of the vision she had seen. When her mother heard, she thanked God and Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary saying:  ""God has heard me; he who is not aloof from his own is not aloof from me, but heard me, for he has accepted my word."" She was stunned and astounded by the vision because she was filled with relief. May God clothe me, his slave, the flowery purple cloth of his Trinity.""  When the wife of the ruler completed the rogation of the forty days, when the days were over, the ruler called his wife and was admitted unto her. The woman conceived by the prayer of Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary, Mother of God. Before (the child) was conceived and before it was born and also after it was born, good saints and those to whom Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary appeared bore witness saying, ""It is fulfilled for you; Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary shall give you a male child who will be useful and pleasing."" From here on, she lived thanking God and Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary. Her day of delivery came, and she gave birth to a male child on the memorial day of Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary, on the 21st of the month of Terr.  When the ruler heard that his wife had given birth to a male child, he praised God and thanked Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary. When the (period) of forty days (since his birth) was completed, they took the child to the church of Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary to baptize him. They baptized the child and called his name, his baptismal name, Bäsenˀa Maryam. But the mother of the wife of the ruler called the name of the child of her daughter Bârtâloméwos [= Bartholomew]. Then everyone went home. The mother of the child, too, went home in peace. They lived in great pleasure, making the memorial of Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary every year on the 21st of the month of Terr. They thanked Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary.  The child grew up by the power of God, his God, and by the power of Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary, his support. His father called the child and saw him and was pleased. He said to the nurse, ""Did my son grow like this without suckling?"" The nurse of the child said, [f.l77r] ""Yes,/ your son, my lord, grew without suckling. He did not suckle more than five months."" When the father heard (this), he admired and said, ""Truly, Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary nursed this child of mine. As of now, may the name of this child be Bâtârgéla Maryam"" Since then the child was called Bâtârgéla Maryam. After sometime, the ruler took his son, the child, to the church of Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary and incised his face with a razor and gave him to Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin [Mary], and made him take refuge with her to guard him with her hand in this world and in the world to come. The child grew up by the prayer of Our Lady Twice Virgin Mary Mother of God, the Mother of Our Lord Jesus Christ. May Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary bless today our community; she is the ladder of our prayer and our power forever. Amen. Listen my fathers and brothers, the Christian Orthodox people. This child was conceived and born by the petition of our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary and from her Son because he became the son of her house.6 The child said: ""My Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary became my support. When my soul was about to come out because of the severity of the pain of my illness, she brought me back and healed me well by the mercy of her beloved Son. And her compassion was on me all of a sudden."" And now, may Our Lady Mary grant me entrance into the Kingdom of Heaven, to me your slave. Amen Haile, Getatchew. 1982.

The miracle and wonder which she worked for the child Bâtârgéla Maryam. May her prayer be with her slave Ma'eqäbä Egzi'. Amen. Now when the child Bâtârgéla Maryam grew up, he was constantly in attendance at the palace of the ruler, his father. There rose against the child envious and corrupt people whom Satan used as lyre and horn. They accused many of the children of the ruler, and many were destroyed by the accusation of the cursed Satan, some with flogging and some with imprisonment. Many of the messengers of Satan accused him to the ruler saying, ""This child is at one with them; he did not separate from them."" When the ruler heard (this) from many fraudulent people, he imprisoned the child. The child remained with his two imprisoned brothers. In those days there broke on the whole population a fatal pestilence that was unspeakable. On a certain night, while the child was asleep, he saw before him an icon of Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary with her beloved child, and an icon of the Crucifixion of her Son, too. The man who saw (the vision) said: ""There came towards ire My Lord Jesus Christ nailed on the cross. His mouth looked like charcoal fire. He called me three times with his life-giving voice, saying, 'Bätärgela Maryam.' Having said this he became silent."" He continued, ""And I rose up in joy thanking God and My Holy Lady Twice. Virgin Mary bearer of charcoal fire."" Even after he saw this vision he lived crying and lamenting to Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary. He always prayed to her with great diligence. He said, ""O My Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary, the helper of those who are lost, have not my father and mother given me to you!"" Having said this, he incised himself several times with a razor, for Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary. Then once, when a Satanic man accused him, the ruler called the child to him. The ruler sent the one who accused him to call Bâtârgéla Maryam. [f.l77v] That corrupt man called Bâtârgéla Maryam/with a quiet voice, like a good man. But he was the likeness of Judas, the messenger of Satan who parted the communion of the clean Apostles, and sold Our Lord Jesus Christ to the Jews, the denyers, for thirty useless pieces of silver so that Our Lord, light from light, might fulfill with his will the vision of the Prophets. He called him and said to Bâtârgéla Maryam, “Come quickly, the ruler calls you."" The boy rose up quickly, in haste, and followed him. The man, in the haste of wickedness, led him and brought him, knowingly, to the desolated (place) where the pestilence was. He made him pass through the desolate (place) in terror and brought him to the great ruler. Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin made the heart of the ruler tender. The ruler spoke to his son with good words of joy and gave him medicine against illness. He said to him, ""Drink! God shall not deliver you to illness, and go to your house."" That man, the son of perdition, returned the son of the ruler by that road through the desolated (place) of the pestilence. The man brought the son of the ruler to his house and turned round and went away. And this man, Bâtârgéla Maryam, was saved by the prayer of Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary from the death of pestilence and from the mouth of rebellious people who were full of foolishness. (Just) before the ruler called him a brother of his had died of pestilence. After he returned from the ruler an(other) brother of his died of liver disease. But Bâtârgéla Maryam was saved by the power of the prayer of Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary the castle of the light of the divinity. And as for those who opposed him, Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary dispersed them like the dust of the field. She destroyed the children of Satan by (her) strong hand, she, Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary, the garden of flaming fire.

The miracle and wonder which she worked for her slave Bâtârgéla Maryam. May the prayer and petition of Our Lady Mary be with her slave Ma'eqäbä Egzi'. Amen. When the pestilence intensified on the whole earth, the ruler gave an order to his son(s) and his daughters at the palace of the ruler - he gave orders to all men and women - to hold rogation to God the highest and to Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary. Bâtârgéla Maryam was in constant attendance, with his brothers, at the palace of the ruler, his father. A brother of Bâtârgéla Maryam died of pestilence while he was together with him. As for Bâtârgéla Maryam, no pain did touch him at all, because he did not experience pestilence at all; he was guarded by the hand of Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary. There was a man, a nephew of Bâtârgéla Maryam, a wicked man cut off by the sword of anathema. He was the father of Satan, (his) equal. Although I say to you ""equal,"" he was not strong but weaker than women. (Furthermore,) he never knew the work of God nor learnt all arts of war like the children of kings and governors. He only lived accusing Bâtârgéla Maryam with his brothers. There was also a man whom they call Mâsârréy at the palace of the ruler who accused Bâtârgéla Maryam to the ruler, his father. Listen my fathers and brothers: It was not two or three persons who opposed him but many people; God knows their number. But Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary delivered him from them. And as for his enemies, she crippled them by the power of her beloved Son. This is Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary, the pride and the power of Christians. When the wicked and fraudulent increased the (false) accusations against Bâtârgéla Maryam to his father, the ruler, and the ruler listened to the accusations of the rebels, the ruler became angry with his son Bâtârgéla Maryam and gave the order that his hands be shackled. They shackled him with two persons in order that they might watch him. There was a wicked man called Sebbuha Amlak. He, together with the son of an infidel, accused Bâtârgéla Maryam to the ruler many times. Even after he was imprisoned, he never ceased for an hour accusing Bâtârgéla Maryam to the ruler, his father. But Bâtârgéla Maryam cried and lamented to Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary saying, ""O Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary, I was conceived by the order of your Son and born by the power of your prayer. Have not my father and my mother delivered me to you by incising my face? Delay not your help from me, but have compassion upon me quickly."" Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary is tender-hearted to all creatures; she had compassion on him; she made the heart of the ruler tender. The ruler gave order that they untie his left hand from the shackle, twelve days after he was shackled. When he was united from the shackle of the left hand those pernicious ones were put to shame, but they still continued accusing him. Listen my fathers and brothers, the sheep of the Gospel, Bâtârgéla Maryam incised himself with a razor for Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary on the day of her conception by Joachim in the womb of Anne on the 7th of (the month of) Nâhasé. And on that day his left hand was untied from the shackle, and the ruler called him to a church to take with him the body and the blood of Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, which was given for the forgiveness of sin and for the preservation of the soul and the body. He lived praying diligent y to God, the Lord, and to Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary, daughter of Judah and daughter of Levi the sacrificer. Bâtârgéla Maryam started in faith the fast of (the month of) Nâhasé, which is called the fast of Mary, until the day of the Assumption of Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary, from this world of darkness into the Garden of happiness. When the Holy day of the Assumption of Our Lady Twice Virgin Mary came, the ruler called that wicked man called Sabbuha Amlak, who accused Bâtârgéla Maryam, on the eve of the holy day of Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary. In the morning, when it was (time of) Communion, the ruler went to Church, for he was a beloved one of Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary. He sent to Bâtârgéla Maryam saying thus, ""Let them untie you from the shackle of your right hand for the sake of the name of Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary. Come quickly so that you may take the Communion with us."" When the messenger told this message to Bâtârgéla Maryam, Bâtârgéla Maryam was happy and joyful. They untied him from the shackle. He went to the church and took the Holy Mystery which is the body and blood of Jesus Christ. They spent the day rejoicing and thanking God in canticles and songs. When they finished singing the canticles of Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary, everyone went home with the ruler. Bâtârgéla Maryam, too, went to his lodging in pleasure and joy. On the third day, Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary, through the hand of her slave the ruler, thrashed that infidel called Sebbuha Amlak who lived accusing Bâtârgéla Maryam. When Bâtârgéla Maryam heard that she had made that rebel fall, he praised and thanked God, the praised, the God of the saints. He also thanked Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary, the mother of the Christians. [f.l78r] O faithful people/the Christians: How much can I tell you (of) what Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary has done for Bâtârgéla Maryam, her slave. May she cover him with her hand, hiding him from the hand of Satan, and give him from the Holy Mysteries of her first-born. (May you do) for me, too, likewise, your servant Ma'eqäbä Egzi' forever.

Amen. There was a Christian king, a lover of God, whose faith was orthodox, and whose actions were good. He loved Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin, the Ark of the Holy Spirit, Mary, Mariham, with all his heart and with all his soul. Out of his exceeding love for her, he had an image (icon) statuette made in her likeness and adorned (it) with gold and silver and precious stones. He prayed constantly with this image, day and night. He honored it exceedingly in fear and trembling. Whenever he would stand for prayer by that image, it seemed to him that he was standing before his Creator, and so his eyes would shed burning tears and all his members would be trembling and terror-struck, Whenever he would pray (standing) by that image, all his concern(s) and the desire(s) of his heart would be granted and fulfilled. There were times when the image spoke to him openly; and there were times when it spoke to him through visions. One day he prayed with persevering heart, lamenting and weeping, f. 63v/ while standing by the image (of) Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin, the Ark of the Holy Spirit, Mary, Mariham, saying, ""O My Lady, I ask you that you receive the yearning of my mind, testing my heart and reins (to see) that I love you from the depth of my heart. Behold, this is my petition, O My Lady. If you do not let me inherit the Heavenly Kingdom as well together with the elect kings who have pleased you with all their hearts, take my soul away from this kingdom of the corruptible world, whose passing away is like a shadow and a borrowed garment. I just take refuge in you that you may say, ""yes,"" to me, and may not neglect the supplication of me, your sinful servant, because it has been vouchsafed to you from the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit that you receive the prayer of us, your people, and obtain the remission of our sins, for to you is meet thanksgiving, glory, worship, power and might at all times, forever and ever. Amen. When he finished his prayer, Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin, the Ark of the Holy Spirit, Mary, Mariham, came to him openly, not in a vision or in a dream, and said to him, ""O My beloved one, behold I have obtained for you from my Son, Jesus Christ, all that you have asked f. 64r from me. It is not only to you alone that the Kingdom/ of Heaven shall be given; but to all of your children who have come from your loins the Kingdom of Heaven shall be given. As for the earthly Kingdom there shall be some among your children that shall reign and some that shall not reign; the Kingdom of Heaven, however, is vouchsafed to all of them, without discriminating against any one of them. I have given you this convenant while you are alive, that is, that you and your children inherit the Kingdom of Heaven."" Having said this, Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin, the Ark of the Holy Spirit, Mary, Mariham, was hidden from him. All this that happented (was) because of the love of Our Lady. See, O doves of the Gospel, the greatness of the generosity and the goodness of this damsel, the Mother of Emmanuel. To a man who loves her from the depths of his heart, when he asks and prays, she bestows an earthly kingdom as well as the Heavenly Kingdom, which is the greatest and the highest. May her prayer and her blessing be with all of her servants and maids, forever and ever. Amen. Now, too, we pray and supplicate you O Mary, Virgin, Mother of the Sovereign. As you received the prayer of this king, your beloved one, today, too, be pleased with the desire of the mind of [Habtä Iyyäsus] your servant, the son of your maid, forever and ever. Amen.

A miracle of Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin, the Ark of the Holy Spirit, Mary, Mariham; may her intercession be with our King Lebnä Dengel, amen. There was a Christian king, a lover of God the Most High and of Mary, his Virgin Mother; his faith was steadfast and his actions were good. He had an image of Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin, the Ark of the Holy Spirit, Mary, Mariham, adorned with gilt. He always prayed to that image when sorrow and anguish befell him. Now the general of this king rebelled and went off and joined the enemies of his reign, the wicked Moslems. When the God-loving king heard (this), he rose up and stood by the image of Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin, the Ark of the Holy Spirit, Mary, Mariham, and prayed f. 71 v saying, ""What has happened to your covenant, / O My Lady, that you once made with me, saying"" 'I will fulfill for you every prayer of your heart, even every good thing that you have not thought of, I will give you from my Son' ? Now, too, listen to my petition and give me a fair answer through your image according to your custom, O My Mother and My Lady and the horn of my salvation. This is what I seek from you against this retainer of mine who has revelled against me and has joined the enemy of my reign and has also denied your Son and you. For this reason I beseech you, falling down and prostrating myself before your image that you take re- venge on him for me."" At once she answered him from the image saying, ""Rejoice, ■ O my beloved one; I have done for you what you have asked of me. In regard to the one who rebelled against you, I have had his head cut off where he went."" Having said this, she showed him the rebel with his head cut off. See, O congregation of the Gospel, that this Virgin is the receiver of the prayer of those in anguish and the deliverer of those in trouble. May her prayer, petition and blessing be with her beloved/ [Habtä Iyyäsus] the deacon. / In return for his having had her miracle(s) written / in trust and faith,/ may she give him a share in the banquet (that is to take) / place on Mount Zion. / When the Christian Sabbath (e.e.

Orient. No. 652. Fol. 138b, No. 122.] THERE was a certain monk, an abbot, who loved God and our Lady Mary exceedingly. And all the holy men laughed at him and made a mock of him in the matter of intercourse with women; now he was a chaste man and had never touched the impure thing. And one day they all gathered together, and they talked as Satan made them, and they reviled him according to their wont. And they said unto him, ""O abbot, we will ask thee one question; thou must answer it."" And he said unto them, ""If ye will ask the question I will answer you""; and they said unto him, ""Father, hast thou ever sinned?"" And the abbot said unto them, ""Who hath moved you? Or perhaps Satan is speaking in your mouths. Be patient, and depart not from the Law."" And they said unto him, ""We have not seen thee, but it hath been told unto us that thou hast had intercourse with a woman."" And the abbot rose up and went into the sacrarium weeping and crying bitterly, and he prayed to God and to our Lady Mary, saying, ""O thou who art full of grace, remove from me disgrace and the corruption of this world; save me, and make me to rest from the mouth of the holy men."" And as he was praying and saying this our Lady Mary came to him at the ninth hour in the sacrarium. And she said unto them, ""O ye holy men, why do ye sin? Why hath the love of the Enemy entered your hearts, and why do ye teach abuse? Ye shall be a laughing-stock for ever."" And having said this she went into the sacrarium, and took the father up with her and disappeared from their sight; and she carried him up to heaven and he inherited the kingdom of heaven through the intercession of our Lady Mary. And afterwards she sent a punishment of wrath upon the monks and they came to a useless end. Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933. One Hundred and Ten Miracles of Our Lady Mary, pp. 303-304.

A miracle of Mary. May her intercession be with her beloved [Habtä lyyäsus] forever. Amen. Listen to a miracle of Mary. There was a merchant in the land of the Agcazi (= Ethipia) who feared God and who greatly loved Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin, the Ark of the Holy Spirit, Mary, Mariham. One day he purchased a slave from the market of Damot for a little money and went off to make a profit in the market of Bärara, on a Thursday. But the slave escaped from his master in the midst of the market and went off with another man on a long journey. When his master missed him, he toured the markets once, twice and a third time in search of his slave but he could not find any trace of him wherever he went. Now, when this good man lost his slave, he bought a small amount of incense and three candles and hurried to a church which was built in the name of Our Lady Mary saying thus (to himself): ""The power of My Lady Mary's assistance is better for me than the assistance of men."" While the man was walking in the street carrying the incense and the candles, he met Our Lady Mary in the likeness of a noble lady (f. 208v) with two handsome young men standing on her right and left sides. She addressed him saying, ""0 man, where are you going? From where did you set out to arrive here?"" He spoke to her and informed her of all the grief and sorrow that had befallen him in connection with the loss of his slave in the market of Bärara. She further addressed him saying, ""So where are you going now to find your slave that escaped from you?"" He answered her saying, ""I am going to that church which is built in the name of Our Lady Mary with incense and candles to see the power of Our Lady Mary's assistance."" Our Lady responded saying to him, ""Show me the incense and the candles that you have brought."" He showed her the three candles and the small amount of incense. Taking the candles and the incense in her hands, she said to him, ""What is this bit of incense and (these) candles? Are you hoping for the assistance of Mary for the sake of this little offering?"" He said to her, ""If Our Lady Mary helps me in view of this little offering, I shall please her very much and serve her until (f. 209r) I depart from this world."" Having said this, he took the offering from the hands of Our Lady. She went ahead of him to the church with the two young men. Then she disappeared from him. Following behind her, the man entered the church holding the incense and the three candles. He gave them to the priest saying, ""With this incense and (these) candles intercede for me with the Virgin Mary, My Lady, about my slave who escaped from me in the market. If she shows in my regard her miraculous power by finding my slave, I shall celebrate her commemoration till the day of my death."" After he had told this matter to the priest, he, too, started praying and supplicating Our Lady Mary with fervent intension, that she might show him the power of her assistance by finding his slave that had escaped. When he had finished his prayer and come out of the church, he found his slave that had escaped standing outside the door of the church. He questioned him saying, ""Where have you been since you escaped from me? And who took you and brought you here?"" (f. 209v). The slave spoke to his master and said, ""After I escaped from you there came to me where I was living in a distant land, in the house of another man, a noble lady, young men, and she said to me, 'Rise up quickly and go to your master, praying and supplication in my church. Having said this, she disappeared me, her order brought me here although I did not know my way, and you see me, my master'."" When the master of the slave saw the power of the assistance and the miracle of Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin, the Ark of the Holy Spirit, Mariham in Hebrew, he donated the slave to be a servant in that church, the name of Mary, in cutting wood and fetching water for needs of the of his death. And the master of the slave lived on celebrating the commemoration Lady Mary, and so pleased God and departed from this (f. 210r) passing into the Kingdom of Heaven by the intercession of Our Lady Mary. May blessing be with her beloved [Habtä lyäsus] forever and ever. Amen, amen 0 my Lady Mary who is Mariham in Hebrew, the citrus rod of Aaron, and the horn of ointment of Samuel, the Prophet, as you appeared by your goodness to that slave and his master, so that they saw the light of your face and so that they heard your appear to me as (you did) to them and speak to me every day and every And bring it about that I be an invited (guest) with your elect when wedding feast of your Son to be bestowed upon and receive the reward of treasure for their praise,  your servant Tänsa'a Krastos who trust fully in you, forever and ever. Amen and amen.

A miracle of Our Lady, Saint Mary ; may her intercession be with her beloved, [ Habtä Iyyäsus ] , for ever and ever. Amen and amen. The wonderful and marvellous grace and (deed of) power that Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin, the Ark of the Holy Spirit, Mary, who is Mariham in Hebrew, wrought on behalf of a certain priest (who was) her beloved and the beloved of her Son, Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. There was an abbot of a certain monastery who was perfect in all good works and faith. And yet he used to hate and (f. 2341) reject the Mahəlet (= hymns)  of Abunä Giyorgis, and look down on those who chanted his Sä' atat (= Horologium). And those who read the books of his treatises he used to forbid lest they read them and would bind them under anathema with a strict oath. He abrogated them in all his domain, so that no one might chant his Horologium and so that no one might read his books, which were revealed to him from God, those holy writings whose titles are the Mäşəhafa Məsțir (= The Book of Mys tery), the Arganonä [ Wəddase (= The Harp of Praise), the Inzira ] Səbhat (= The Lyre of Glory) , in addition to the Mä şəhafä Säkatat zä - Lelit wå - Mäalt (= The Book of the Night and Day Hours), the Hohətä Bərhan (= The Portal of Light), and the many (other) treatises (dealing with) the Old and New Testaments  that the Holy Spirit inspired him (to write). He abolished and abrogated all these in all his territories so that no one might read and chant (them). Furthermore, he accused [ lit. “slandered "" ] (Abba Giyorgis) of other things and abused him with big words of ignominy that cannot be mentioned, as the prophet has said, “Boast not, talk not very proudly and let not words of arrogance come out of your mouth for the Lord God is the discerner of hearts ” . “God has established his throne (f. 234v) in heaven ; and he rules all in his kingdom "" . While the abbot was (occupied in saying) all these things, Abunä Giyorgis was also (occupied) in speaking and appealing  to God in heaven and to Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin, the Ark of the Holy Spirit, Mary, who is Mariham in Hebrew, about the wrongs done against him, he said to Our Lady, “See (and judge), O My Lady, according to what you know is hidden in my heart. You are aware whether (or not) the knowledge for my treatises and the understanding for the word (s) of my writings have come from the wisdom of men, which consists) in words of asmat (= magic) and the cutting of plants and leaves (i. e. chemistry). According as you have tested me, you my Queen, from the beginning to the end, (and know) whether I have ever added another beloved besides you or whether I have taken a lady other than you, my redeemer, and according as you know and are aware of all my deeds, judge me, I beg you, and let me appear in judgement with the abbot who reviles me and ridicules me before his (spiritual) children, seeing that it is you who justify me or convict me, O my Queen”. Because of the wrongs done against Abunä (f. 2350) Giyorgis, there came forth a word of command from her Son, Jesus Christ, that they should transport the abbot in haste. Thereupon they transported the soul of the abbot suddenly without agony or pain. They made it ascend according to the rite for the ascent of the souls of the righteous elect. At once the angels of light came up with the nine Archangels in order to receive the soul of the abbot. The great Abunä Giyorgis came with honour and grace along with the Archangels, being equal and decorated like them. The abbot wanted to greet them because he was pure in his monasticism, fragrant in his holiness, and perfect in his virginity, and his labour in (ascetic) combat was extreme. When he wanted to draw near to greet them, the Archangels answered the abbot saying, “Behold, Giyorgis appeals against you recalling the wrongs done against him”. Having said this, they refused an exchange of greeting and left him and went to their assignments. Then they made him ascend higher where the Seraphim were hallowing around (f. 235v) the throne of God. Giyorgis, too, was there incensing, ranked with them. When the abbot drew near to greet them they refused him because of the wrongs done against Abunä Giyorgis. Then they made him ascend where the Cherubim were hallowing on (all) sides of the throne. (There too,) he found Giyorgis ranked with them, carrying the throne of the Righteous Judge. When the abbot drew near to greet them, the Cherubim refused him saying, “Behold, Giyorgis appeals against you, recalling the wrongs done against him”. In a manner similar to this, there came up to the abbot in order to receive him the company of the Prophets in their ranks from Adam to Abraham, from Abraham to Moses, from Moses to John (the Baptist) and from John to Joseph and Nicodemus, who shrouded the body of Jesus Christ, and with them was Abba Giyorgis equal in majesty and grace. When the abbot drew near in order to greet them, they answered him saying, “Greet us not, because Giyorgis appeals against you, recalling to us the wrongs done against him”. After the Prophets, there came the Apostles (f. 236r) of Jesus Christ, from our father Peter to our father Mathias and from our father Paul to all the disciples and doctors – Basil, Gregory and John Chrysostom – and with them was Abunä Giyorgis ranked equal in dignity and authority. He prevented them from greeting the abbot, recalling to them the wrongs done against him . After the Apostles of Our Lord, there came the Martyrs of the Most High : St. Stephen, Blessed George (who is) the King of the Martyrs, Basilides of Antioch, with Theodore, Claudius, Blessed Justus and his son Aboli, St (s). Victor and Mercurius, Blessed Peter, Patriarch of Alexandria, the last of the martyrs, and all the Innocents of Galilee, whose blood was shed in witness to the truth, and with them was Abba Giyorgis, equal in beauty, grace and crown of glory, and like the chosen Innocents, in the adornment of (his) garments. When they wanted to greet him, Abba Giyorgis prevented them (from doing so), recalling the wrongs done against him. Then there came our holy (Desert) Fathers, Abba Paul, Abba Anthony, Abba Macarius, Abba Shenute, Abba Cyrus, the son of the (f. 236v) Emperor (º), Abba Bishoi, who washed (the feet of) Jesus , with all the monks who lived in caves and those who lived) in cells, and with them came Giyorgis adorned with chastity and sanctity like the angels. When the abbot drew near to greet the monks, they answered him saying, “Our son Giyorgis appeals against you, recalling to us the wrongs done against him”. Then, after all of them, came Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin, the Ark of the Holy Spirit, Mary, who is Mariham in Hebrew, and together with her there were Hannah / Anne and Elizabeth, her faithful ones, and all the holy Virgins, Maria and Martha, Mary of Cleophas, (the other) Mary, Salome and Mary Magdalene, and Sts. Sophia, Eupraxia , Anatolia  and The ocleia  and Blessed Barbara and Juliana, and Inbamärena  and the Blessed Tekla, sister of Abba Esi . There, there were also our mother Eve, our mother Edna , our mother Barä ka , and our Matriarch (s), Sarah, Rebekah, Rachel, Leah, Dinah, Deborah and Judith, together with Esther and Asenath  Our Lady Mary came (f. 2376) escorted and encircled by the choir of angels ; Our Lady Mary came while the Prophets were praising her, the Apostles were blessing her, all the company of the Saints and Martyrs were proclaiming her beatitude and Abunä Giyorgis was singing and chanting before her the Arganonä Waddase (= The Harp of Praise) and the Inzira Sabḥat (= The Lyre of Glory)  until the hosts of heaven were amazed at the greatness of his honour. When he came up, the abbot prostrated himself before Our Lady the holy twofold Virgin, the Ark of the Holy Spirit, Mary, who is Mariham in Hebrew. Then, when he wanted to greet her, she answered him saying, “My beloved Giyorgis appeals against you, saying about you : You did me wrong and you reviled me '. But to the extent that I known and have in vestigated the hidden (thoughts) of Giyorgis, I shall make peace between you and him”. Then she said to her beloved Giyorgis, “Behold, the one about whom you say, ' He has done me wrong ; he has reviled me ; he, together with his (spiritual) children, has slandered me'. Behold, I have commanded him in your regard, that he compensate you generously for having slandered you and reviled you in his ignorance”. She then commanded the abbot to submit to Abba Giyorgis. And so Our Lady Mary, who is Mariham in Hebrew, made peace and amity between (f. 237v) the two of them. After that the abbot returned to his former existence by the command of Our Lady Mary. He immediately) went back to his place and gathered together all his (spiritual) children and told them all the grief and affliction that had befallen him in heaven because he had reviled and slandered Abunä Giyorgis. Then he commanded them all to chant his Horologium and (read) the books of all his homilies in all (the churches) built in his domain . The abbot himself, too, from that time on, began to chant the Horologium of the night and the day (hours) and read the book (s) of Abunä Giyorgis without interruption. He persevered in proclaiming and telling everywhere how he had seen with his own eye (s) and heard with his own ear (s) the great ness and honour of Abunä Giyorgis that was given him in heaven. All this happened to the abbot because of his virtue and goodness and because of a miracle of Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin, the Ark of the Holy Spirit, Mary, who is Marihan in Hebrew. May her prayer and petition be with all of us, the children (f. 238r) of baptism, forever and ever. Amen, amen and amen. // O my Lady Mary, who are Mariham in Hebrew, who are / shod with the moon and are clothed with the sun, you who, for the abbot who pleased you, made peace and amity with your faithful one, Abba / Giyorgis, O holy and pure Mary, who are without blemish, for me, too, your devout [ Habtä Iyyäsus), who hopes ever / in you, weaken my opponent by the power of your help.

365,Giyorgis's writing: Saint Mary cuts short her visit to a pious monk when she hears her name invoked according to the horologium of Abba Giyorgis.,,,LIT5327MiracleVisit,"EMML 2275, copied 1508-1540, from 1478-1494 mss, f 233v-240v, Miracle 150.  miracle 150 appears in EMML 213, 544, 1180, 2251 (all copies of this mss) (f. 238r) 150. A miracle of Our Lady Mary, Mariham; may her prayer, petition and blessing be with her servant (Habtä Iyyäsus ] for ever and ever. Amen. Now listen, O children of the Church, to the miraculous deed of power of Our Lady which she wrought for those who were devoted to her and were serving her with all their hearts and were chanting the Säatat (= Horologium) of Giyorgis, her beloved, day and night . There was a monk who loved God the Most High with all his heart and all his power. Our Lady Mary, who is Mariham in Hebrew, was continually visiting him (f. 238v) because of his sanctity and because of the purity One day, while Our Lady was with him at the third hour of the day, where she was a guest to visit him, those (devoted) clergymen began to chant the Sä'atat (= Horologium) of Blessed Abba Giyorgis according to their custom. When they came in the text of the hymn to (the place) where it says, “Come, Virgin, with the Prophets to receive our trust (in you) at (this) third hour. Come, Virgin, with the Apostles to bless our community at (this) third hour. Come, Virgin, with the Martyrs to obtain the remission of our sins at (this) third hour. Come, Virgin, with the Virgins and the Monks to cleanse our filth at (this) third hour. Come, Virgin, with the Righteous to prosper our life at (this) third hour. Come, Virgin, with the Angels to offer up our prayer. Stretch out your hand and bless us all ” , and hearing them chant this hymn, Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin, the Ark of the Holy Spirit, Mary, who is Mariham in Hebrew, left that chosen (f. 2391) monk and rose up to go to bless those who were assembled, when they invoked her with fervent love, together with the company of the Prophets and the Apostles, with the company of the Righteous and the Monks and the company of the Martyrs, and with the company of all the vigilant Angels. The monk responded saying to Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin, the Ark of the Holy Spirit, Mary, who is Mariham in Hebrew, “Where are you going, O my Queen? And for whom are you leaving me? Is there any other (person) who loves you as much as I do? And is there any other person who takes refuge in you from the depth of his heart as much as I do?” Our Lady Mary answered the monk saying, “I am going where the community of the Church is invoking me, to those who are invoking me in trust with my fathers the Prophets. I am going where they are invoking me to bless (their) community with my sons the Apostles. I am going where they are invoking me to absolve their sins with my children the Martyrs. To those who have invoked me with the Righteous, my faithful ones, I am going in haste to prosper their ways. To those who have invoked me (f. 239V) with the Virgins and the Monks, my chosen ones, I am going to cleanse them from all the filth of their sins. And to those who have invoked me with the spiritual Angels, I go running and hurrying to offer up the prayer of the children of the Church to the throne of my Son and his Father and his Holy Spirit. When the chosen monk heard from the mouth of Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin, the Ark of the Holy Spirit, Mary, who is Mariham in Hebrew, of all this grace that is given to the community of the Church that serves God with a clean heart and a right intention, without blemish and without dissimulation, abandoning revenge and grudges, as the prophet has said in Psalm 2, “Serve God with fear and rejoice unto him with trembling. Strengthen wisdom (in you) lest God be angry, and you perish from the right way "" , then that monk said to Our Lady Mary, “O My Queen, if all this grandeur and honour is given from you to those who chant to you in the assembly of the community and they receive them (there), from henceforward, I, too, shall never separate myself nor (f. 2400) part from the chanting of the community of the Church until the day of my death "" . Then Our Lady Mary blessed the chosen monk together with the whole assembly of the community of holy Church and ascended into heaven with great glory, while all the hosts of the angels were praising her. May her prayer, petition and blessing be with all of us Christians forever and ever. Amen and amen . Here are completed and ended the miracles of Our Lady Mary, 150 in number. Glory be to God, forgiver of all transgressions. Amen . O My Lady Mary, who is Mariham in Hebrew, the sister of the spiritual Angels, the horn of proclamation of the blessed Prophets of Israel, you are the grace of the Apostles (who were) sent and the Mother of the victorious Martyrs. You are the power of the help of the souls of the chosen Righteous and the strength of the patience of the combating Monks. As you became a guest (comirg) from the highest place to visit this monk, and as you blessed the community of the Church who served you with a right intention without turning aside, O daughter of light. me, too, (f. 240v) [ Habtä lyyäsus ], bless with your hand, as you blessed those blessed ones. And sanctify me with your holiness, as you sanctified Abba Giyorgis of forceful tongue ; and perfume me with the odor of your ointment as you perfumed Giyorgis, your beloved, the harp of the Church. And hide me in the shadow of your wings from the turmoil of men and from the words of (evil) tongues. When your Son provides a banquet on the site of Mount Zion, allot me a place to recline with your blessed sheep, me, your servant, [ Habtä Iyyäsus ] who take refuge in the help of your promises.

Fol. 76a, 1.] THERE was a certain holy man whose name was John Kama, who from his youth up had sought after the love of Christ with great strivings, and when he had grown up they (i.e. his kinsfolk) betrothed him unto a young woman who was a virgin, so that he might marry her. But he made an agreement with her that they should preserve their virginity until the day of their death, and they fulfilled their covenant. And on a certain day, which was the night of Sunday, our holy Lady, Mary the twofold Virgin, the God-bearer, appeared unto John Kama in great glory, and the angels were hovering about her. And by reason of his fear he fell upon his face, but she raised him up, and said unto him, ""Peace be unto thee, O John Kama, who art be loved of my Son, and of His Father, and of the Holy Ghost. Rejoice and be strong, for through thy patient endurance thou shalt become a mighty man, and thou shalt vanquish the unclean spirit-beings of might who array themselves against thee. And I will be with thee until the Will of God be fulfilled, and I will give thee my protection, and my mercy shall preserve thee, and shall be with thee for multitudes of generations. And they shall build a church in thy name, and it shall be called by the name of myself and of my Son; and no enemy or foe shall enter into thy shrine; and the walls thereof shall never be overthrown. And thy [spiritual] sons shall walk in thy commandment, and in thy teaching, and in thy law; and they shall shew themselves loving the one to the other, and they shall live in purity and make offerings unto thee. I will be with them for ever, and I will bless their service and the work of their hands, and they shall inherit everlasting life, together with the kingdom of heaven."" Then she gave him three dinars that were stamped with the sign of the Cross, saying, ""Take these, and put them in the chest of the church that they may be a blessing for ever"" (now they are there unto this day); and having said these words she gave him the salutation of peace, and left him and departed. Then John Kama rejoiced, and he sang the words of the Psalm (xxvii. 8 ff.), saying, ""I have sought Thy face, Thy face, O Lord, I seek. Turn not Thy face away from me, and be a helper unto me; and cast me not away so that I may do Thy will, O my Lord and God."" Observe then, O my brethren, that our Lady Mary doth make herself a protector and a teacher of sinners, and that she doth become a helper of the righteous, for it is by means of her intercession that they fulfil their strivings. And she doth help even the sinful, and doth protect and deliver them from out of the hand of Satan their enemy. Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933.

And our Lady Mary appeared unto him in a vision and said unto him,  Thou art a man who hast lived to thyself all the days of thy life without knowing me, but when death cometh to thee thou dost know me."" And the sick man said, ""Now I know [thee], and I will become thy servant; make me not a thing for the Judgement, but heal me."" And our Lady Mary, who sheweth grace unto all creatures, and healeth the sick, and is compassionate unto all who take refuge with her, spat and anointed the whole body of the sick man with her spittle, and he was healed straightway. And all those who saw and heard of this miracle marvelled, and the man became well pleasing unto our Lady Mary and loved her. Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933.

420,The man who accepted fine clothes as a bribe for future favors.,,,LIT5366MiracleBribe,"EMML 2059, f. 69r  The miracle of Our Lady Mary, who is Mariham in Hebrew. May her prayer and blessing be with us. Amen.  There was a country among the Christian countries. Great Christian people lived in it strictly guarded, because they had a guard who guarded them so that many people should not come to them from other countries with- out the permission of the great ruler. They, too, were made rulers in their turn when God called them to rule the country.  Now the ruler appointed a man to guard those great people strictly so that no one should come to them from another country. The official made friends with one of those great people so that he might do him favor when he ascended the highest office. He made a covenant with him and gave him and his wife precious and beautiful clothes. But the great ruler appointed their friend, the official, to another country. When the official, their friend, went away from them they grieved greatly. The man and his wife were very frightened. They said, ""Woe unto us; if our friendship and covenant with the official are discovered the great ruler will kill us. Where shall we hide the clothes which he gave us? It will never remain our secret even if we dig the ground and bury [them], or hide [them] in our grain store or burn [them] with fire."" Having said this, they went to [another] one of those great people and said to him, ""0 our friend, we have come to you so that you might comfort us in whatever way God reveals to you, because a great grief has befallen us."" He said to them, ""What is your grief?"" They said to him, ""We adjure you in the name of God that you will not disclose our affair to other people."" He said to them, ""Let it be so."" Then they told him about the clothes which their friend the official had given them, and how they could not find [a place] where they might hide [them]. He said to them, ""Give the clothes to the church of St. Mary of such and such city altering1 ^them] as [they] should be for [use in] a church. I trust that Our Lady Mary will remove your grief caused by the calamity you are worried about."" They said to him, ""You said well, 0 friend; the Spirit of God spoke through you. But we do not know how to sew, 0 our friend."" He said to them, ""I shall sew [them] for you helped by the power of the prayer of Our Lady Mary, Mother of God."" They gave him the clothes so that he might sew [them] for them. When they finished sewing [them] they gave [them] to the church of Our Lady Mary, who is Mari ham in Hebrew. She removed their grief and delivered them from the calamity they had anticipated.  Then Our Lady Mary, who is Ma riham in Hebrew, appeared to the man who advised those people to give the clothes to the church of Our Lady Mary, on the 29th of the month of Maggabit, the day on which she conceived Our Saviour. She appeared to him in the likeness of a beautiful woman with a red face. The edge of her eyelashes was clear as if she had cried very much. She told him about the beating of his body with a stick which he would receive from the great ruler.  Nine months later she held his hands and said to him, ""Did they beat you with a stick? But be not afraid; your bones are not broken."" Then the man saw on the same night [in a vision], a big white tent pitched. He saw Our Holy Lady Virgin Mary entering into the tent. He , too, entered [the tent] following her. There he found the great ruler lying down and Our Lady Mary, who is Mari ham in Hebrew, sitting by his head. There was a silver ring on the finger of the ruler. She ordered the great ruler to give his ring to the / man. He refused. She ordered the man to take the silver ring from the finger of the ruler. He took [it], as she has ordered him, and put [it] on his finger. Furthermore, she said to him, ""Suckle the breast of the ruler."" When he suckled [it] there cane out milk for him in great quantity. Furthermore, she said to him, ""Make the memorial of the ruler; I entrust [that] to you. Take heed, never forget his memorial."" Having said this, she disappeared from him.  After that the man sat on the throne of the ruler for many years, appointed to his dominion by the intercession of Our Lady Mary, who is Mariham in Hebrew. May her prayer and blessing be with her slave Bəsṭawros forever. Amen. Haile, Getatchew. 1982. ""INSIDE THE ROYAL CONFINEMENT.""

1005,Claiming the grotto for a church of the Blessed Virgin.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),,,"A miracle of Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God. May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved Son be with her servant Gäbrä Maryam forever and ever. Amen. In the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Listen to this, our fathers and brothers! Let us tell you the story of the miracle of Our Lady Mary which she worked at Däbrä Zämäddo in the rock grotto. A certain woman, whose husband was dead, had lived in it with her many possessions and many children. The name of the woman was Zämädä Maryam. But the courtyard she occupied belonged to Our Lady that her Son, Our Lord, had given her, saying, “Let it be your tithe”. When the time came for the owner of the house to move in to live (in it), she decided to evict the woman. (So) she stirred up a certain God-fearing monk from an island in the west called Mǝṣraḥa. The name of the monk was Bärtälomewos. He never had that place in mind. Rather, he set out (from Mǝṣraḥa) to go to Jerusalem. But our Lady turned him to the direction of her house and brought him, with the two exalted and honored angels, Michael and Gabriel, guiding him. They came to the woman and begged her, saying, “Vacate this place for us so that we may place (in it) the tabot of Our Lady”.  She replied to them, saying to them, “Where should I go? What shall become of me? I have no other house. And it is impossible for me to build a house. Furthermore, my children are young, and my household materials that God gave me are many”. She said this and refused their request. And the saints went back. For Our Lady’s custom is like that of a child who gives and begs whatever it is. Although she knew (the woman’s) thinking, nevertheless she sent messengers to teach us, the arrogant ones, the path of humility. In regards to the woman, she did not requite her with requital due to misers when she saw her stubborn mind. Rather, on that very night, she lifted her up with her children and all her possessions – without a shred of grass or a broken piece of glass falling – took her far away and placed her in a field called Märḥǝbä Si’ol because of the severity of the cold and frost that come down upon it. When she woke up from her sleep, she was shocked and trembled. But Our Lady did not cause her to be shocked nor to fear. She rather placed her well. At that time, the woman stood up and went to her former courtyard so that she could know what was going on. When she arrived, she found Abunä Bärtälomewos with the tabot of Our Lady Mary, having installed a wooden curtain. She admired this and was amazed; she had no word with which to react. In regards to our father, he lived happily, serving (Mary) with good service. And many doves, who were born from him and who took refuge with Our Lady Mary, filled it. Now let us go back to the subject which we had left. Please, do not agree, O man, when a critique criticizes, saying, “Why did she take away her courtyard without her consent?” Please, do not rush to judge, O man, against Our Lady before you know its mystery. For Our Lady does not abolish a law but makes laws; and she does not take forcibly others’ possessions. Let not your heart think that she took it from (the woman) forcibly. Rather, Our Lady was the first (to own) the courtyard, as she had received it from her Son. And you, the skeptic, will find (this fact) in another section, if you are not impatient. Abunä Bärtälomewos finished his time in toil and exhaustion, as the power of Our Lady helped him. May her prayer and blessing keep us and help us finish (our time) in good health and peace forever and ever. Amen. Getatchew, Haile, 1st ed., 2013.

1006,Abbot Abunä Yoḥannǝs transported to Jerusalem.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),,,"After Abunä Bärtälomewos passed away, five shepherds were appointed to this mäkan. After that, Our Lady Mary sum-moned Abunä Yoḥannǝs, the pillar and foundation of the church, and drew him with the rope of her love from his country called Ǧan Amora, whose owner he was. For the sake of the love he had for Our Mary and for the sake of the love he had for her Son, he abandoned all the love of this world and its material and stood up quickly to go to where he had been called, to see the end and conclusion of the matter. When he left his country and was travelling on the road, he thought, and the thought which came to him was, “Go to Jerusalem”, came to him. As he was vacillating, he came to a certain village; he lodged there for the night and slept. At midnight, Our Lady came, picked him up and brought him to Jerusalem. She showed him all (the holy) places: (she took him) to the manger, where Our Lord was born; and to (the River) Jordan, where Our Lord was baptized – coming out (of the river, Our Lord) had sat on a rock which was at the bank of the river. She brought him to a place (called) Calvary, where Our Lord was crucified, and to his Golgotha Sepulcher. And she brought him up to Mount of Olive. She fulfilled for him (his wish) in a single night in a spiritual vision. The night was over as he woke up from his sleep and wondered. When morning broke, he resumed his journey. As he was on his journey, he met a certain poor woman. The woman said to him, “Listen to my words, O my brother!” And he said to her – for he was meek and a lover of the poor – “Go on, tell me your concern”. She told him many spiritual matters, and exhorted him. Having heard, he separated himself and resumed his journey. As he walked he met monks who were going to Abba Täṭämqä Mädḫǝn, the righteous and combatant (monk). He, too, went along with them. They arrived at the door of the monk. But Abunä Yoḥannǝs remained behind by the door to keep the support sticks and foot gears of the monks. Since he was meek and humble, he stayed behind alone to keep others’ possessions. They entered into the house and met with Abba Täṭämqä Mädḫǝn. When they met, Abunä Täṭämqä Mädḫǝn said to them, saying to them, “You have left outside at the door an exalted and honored person”. He said this and ordered them to call him in. They went out and searched. They returned to (Abba Täṭämqä Mädḫǝn) and said to him, “We did search, but we did not find one single person”. As for our father, they ignore him; they did not consider him someone like them because of his small body. He admonished them again, and said to them “Go and call in the righteous and honored one”. They said to him a third time, “There is nobody other than the child who keeps our support sticks”. He said to them, “Call this honored one in”. When Abunä Yoḥannǝs entered the house, Abunä Täṭämqä Mädḫǝn stood up from afar for the reception of Abunä Yoḥannǝs. He said to him, “Did you come back safely, O pilgrim of Jerusalem?” He said this and had (this) exhortation to follow: he said to him, “For now, lest you go to Jerusalem, Our Lady Mary has called you to keep the order of her house. And Abunä Bärtälomewos has prayed to God that you may keep his tomb. So, today you will not go. What you saw is enough for you. But later you will”. He also told him a secret; he said to him, “Regarding the woman who met you on the road, you should not think she was, or liken her to, one of the worldly poor. Rather, she was Our Lady Mary. Keep everything she told you. For the habit of Our Lady Mary is such when she visits the whole world. When she visits us in order to save us from our enemy, the serpent, one day she would appear in the likeness of the poor and another day she would appear in the likeness of honored people”. After Abunä Täṭämqä Mädḫǝn told him (this), she took him to Däbrä Zämäddo where she appointed him and made him the shepherd to the sheep of her house. May the prayer and blessing of Our Lady Mary and the prayer of these shepherds keep us from a sudden death and make us inherit the hall of the Kingdom forever and ever. Amen.

1007,The sainthood of young Abunä Yoḥannǝs revealed.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),,,"Listen! Let me tell you what Our Lady Mary did for Abunä Yoḥannǝs: When she summoned him from his country, she met him on the road looking like a poor woman. She also made him meet with Abunä Täṭämqä Mädḫǝn who interpreted for him everything. And then she appointed him shepherd of her sheep. Two years after he was appointed, and the time came about when she told him in the mouth of Täṭämqä Mädḫǝn, “Later you will go to Jerusalem”, grace stirred him and incited him. He sought someone who would ask God to straighten his journey for him, and Our Lady Mary that she may keep him from all evil. Since he was a humble person, he would not do what benefited himself. So he went to a certain woman who was God-fearing and a lover of Our Lady Mary, whose name was Sälome, who lived in the country of Qǝbtya, and said to her, “Pray for me to Our Lady Mary that she may guide me and make me come to Jerusalem and return me in good health and in peace”. She said to him, “Alright” and prayed to Our Lady Mary. When she prayed to her, Our Lady Mary came and said to her, “What are you requesting from me?” And she said to her, “It is about Yoḥannǝs, the abbot of Zämäddo; for he wants to go to Jerusalem”. Our Lady Mary heard and answered her about another matter. She showed her a shining city, decorated with flowers and fruits. She showed her what she had not asked her (to show her). The woman said to Our Lady Mary, “Whose is (this) city which is honored with this much honor?” Our Lady said to her, “It belongs to Bärtälomewos, the abbot of Zämäddo”. After she said this, (Our Lady Mary) followed with another matter. She started to tell her the glory of Däbrä Zämäddo. She said to her, “Zämäddo is my tithe which my Son gave me; it is a sister of Jerusalem”. Because it is the sister of Jerusalem, you, too, O man, know that Däbrä Zämäddo is more honored than the monasteries of Ethiopia which are called resting places of the righteous. For Jerusalem is honored more than the monasteries which are in the four corners of the world because it is the place of the incarnation of the Creator of the worlds. The end of his martyrdom, too, took place at it; his Sepulcher, too, is at it. And the memory of his Resurrection will be performed everywhere until the end of the world. And how would not Däbrä Zämäddo be more honored than all the monasteries (of Ethiopia), if Our Lady testified about it, saying, “But Zämäddo is my tithe and a sister of Jerusalem”? You, too, do know and comprehend that tithe is God’s property, and is honored more than all properties of the world. A sister is beloved to her sister. Therefore, we say, “Däbrä Zämäddo is (highly) honored, also because it is called a tithe of Our Lady Mary”. Furthermore, let us go back to the subject which we left before, about which you said to me “The house belonged to Zämädä Maryam”. You should not think that the house belonged to a worldly woman but that it is the house of the Lady of all of us. Regarding what I told you in the previous section, “You will find it later”, behold, I have told you (now) that it is the house of Our Lady Mary and her tithe which her Son has given her. And you, if you say to me, “Then why did the woman occupy the house of Our Lady Mary (in the first place)?” I will tell you, saying, “Because she was called by the name of Our Lady Mary”. But if you say to me, “Why did she evict her?” I, too, will say to you, “She has no guilt if she evicts her from her (own) house, and (Mary), the owner of the house, occupied (it)”. Furthermore, let me inform you, saying to you, “At at the be[ginning …” Behold,] we have told you our research on how the construction of Däbrä Zämäddo was started in the hands of Abunä Yoḥannǝs – its beginning and (later) its end. May the prayer and blessing of Our Lady Mary and the grace of Abunä Yoḥannǝs keep us from the host of the serpent, together with Abunä Gäbrä Maryam forever and ever. Amen.

1008,Complaint of the icon for falling on the ground.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),,,"A miracle which Our Lady Mary worked for Abunä Yoḥannǝs and talked with him: After he completed the construction of her church, he placed her icon in it on a chair. One day (the icon) was dropped on the floor without the knowledge of the people of her household. The reason for its dropping was not known. But she went herself to Abunä Yoḥannǝs and said to him, “How are you sitting on your chair while I am dropped on the floor?” She said this and disappeared from him. When Abunä Yoḥannǝs heard the words of Our Lady Mary, he called one of the people of his household, and said to him, “Go quickly, pick up My Lady; for she is dropped on the floor”. The person whom he called replied to our father, saying, “She is not dropped, but is in a good position”. But our father said to him, “I say to you, go quickly and pick her up from the floor and place her on her chair”. Then (the messenger) went, and found her dropped on the flour, as our spiritual father had told him. He picked her up and placed her in a good position, as always, and returned to his father. The latter asked him, saying, “How did you find her?” The messenger replied to him, saying, “Yes, I found her dropped (on the floor) as you said”. Our father praised the messenger when he said, “Yes”. He said to him, “You did well that you told me the truth. If you had lied, in the manner in which you earlier said to me, ‘She is not dropped’, I, too, would have considered you a habitual liar. But you did well that you told me the truth. Behold, Our Lady Mary had come and told me, saying to me, ‘How are you sitting on your good chair while I am dropped on the floor?’ She said this and disappeared from me. For my part, I heard her words that she said to me, and obliged you to go and pick her up. And you, you did well that you said to me, ‘Yes’”. See, my brothers, how to lie is a serious offence. For our father had said to the messenger, “If you had belied my words, I, too, would have considered you a habitual liar”. This matter that he taught to the messenger concerns us as well, that we should keep saying “Yes”, and hate lies, in accordance with the words of Our Lord who said in the Gospel, “If people ask you something, say ‘Yes’, if it is true. But if it is not true, say ‘No/It is not.’” O my brother, regarding this “No/It is not”, you should not think that it is a lie, when you see (a mere) statement of “No/It is not”. Nor should you think, furthermore, that Our Lord had taught us (to lie) if you analyze (the statement of) “No/It is not”. “No/It is not” is truth, if said by itself. “No/It is not” is “Yes”, if it is said about what is not/it is not; it is not “No/It is not”. We, too, our brothers, must pursue the truth, and cast away the lie, so that Our Lady Mary may keep us as she kept Abunä Yoḥannǝs from many traps of Satan. May the prayer and petition of Our Lady Mary dwell in her servant Gäbrä Maryam forever and ever. [Amen.] Getatchew, Haile, 1st ed., 2013.

1009,The detention of the monastery’s cow for recompense.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),,,"A miracle which Our Lady Mary [worked] for Abunä Yoḥannǝs since  the past five (abbots), whom she had helped had passed, by showing her power and by revealing a miracle: (It happened) when the people of his country, who lived in the neighborhood of his abbey, quarreled with him and took his cow forcibly and in arrogance, by reason of the grass on which they said “(The cow) trespassed to graze”. They took it to their home, wanting to drink its milk for this reason. The herdsmen fled, fearing lest they beat them. All this happened, even though our father was their ruler and they were under his reign, because the enemy had instigated them and belittled the power of our father, making his power like nothing. The herdsmen who fled informed our father that the cow was taken booty. When Abunä Yoḥannǝs heard, he went to Our Lady Mary and informed her the news of his oppression – how they took his cow in arrogance – in order that she may show her power, not to requite them with requital due to the violence but only to reveal her miracle, that he was the administrator of her house and that she loved him very much, and also to reveal to them that he was not so weak, because they had said about him, “What can he bring upon us because the status of a monk in this world is like nothing”. Let us return to the former subject which we left. Those who took the cow milked (it) to drink (its milk). And Our Lady revealed her power: she changed the color of the milk as she changed formerly the color of the pair of scissors of Jacob the Short of Qälmon, the tailor of shirts. The pair of scissors was very nice and plated with gold. When an Arab saw the pair of scissors, he stole it from Jacob and took it to his country, knotting it with his garment. When Jacob could not find it, he was very sad. He told Our Lady Mary the sorrow in his heart. When the Arab came to his home country, he opened his garment to see the scissors. He found the pair becoming a serpent, because Our Lady Mary had changed it because of the prayer of Jacob. When the Arab saw it, he was shocked and frightened; he threw it on the ground. He thought of giving it (back) to Jacob. As he was thinking so, the serpent became scissors as before. When the Arab saw this, he returned the scissors to their former owner. Similarly, regarding the milk, although its nature is white, she changed its color and made it blood. When the people of the country saw, they were shocked and frightened. They went to Abunä Yoḥannǝs, having the cow before them. When they came to him, they fell at his feet, causing their tears to flow. They begged him to forgive their offense and to reconcile them with Our Lord Jesus Christ and Our Lady Mary. He, on his side, (had to) accept their repentance, as long as they repented. She changed the milk whose nature is white and made it blood when no offense was found either in the milk or in the cow, but the requital due to the people was revealed in the milk. If the people had not turned away from their crooked path, this change of the milk would have happened to them. Listen, my brothers! Repentance is good and the straight path. It brings people to the Mountain of God. And those people find forgiveness when they pray to Abunä Yoḥannǝs and Our Lady Mary. May the prayer and petition of Our Lady Mary dwell in her servant Gäbrä Maryam forever and ever. [Amen.]  Getatchew, Haile, 1st ed., 2013.

1010,The revolt of the monks against abbot Yoḥannǝs.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),,,"A miracle which Our Lady Mary worked for Abunä  Yoḥannǝs: When the people of the monastery became arrogant and despised his order, he was disturbed and was saddened in his heart very much. When he admonished them and gave them orders, following the rule whenever anything happened, they would violate his command. At that time he would be sad and depressed. A long time passed as they wrangled this way. And they lived a long time not observing what he told them. When the thickness of their hearts was too much, he started to tell his Lady of their violation and the oppression he suffered. The statement of his words ran like this: “If I am unable to keep them and if their hearts are not pleased with my words, you do what you want. You brought me here formerly and appointed me over them while my heart never thought of an appointment. However, at that time, they accepted me with pleasure; and they accepted me unanimously. But now they made their hearts evil. You judge me and them, because you are impartial, and you know the demeanor of all. What else shall I say?” And Our Lady, since she knew his oppression and the arrogance of the people of the monastery, sent pestilence to the people of the monastery. Forty monks died in one week. When Abba Bǝnyami saw, living in Gärägära, by the grace of God, that the pestilence was sent, he sent a message to Abunä Yoḥannǝs, saying, “Pray for them to God and to Our Lady Mary, lest your remaining children be finished, because Our Lady and Our Lord Jesus Christ are angry because of your oppression”. When Abunä Yoḥannǝs heard, he started rogation, carrying a big rock on his head and touring the shrine twelve times every day. Within twelve days, the wrath of God receded. The remainder of his children was saved by the prayer of Our Lady Mary. For whoever goes to her does not suffer; and whoever trusts in her will not be ashamed. Regarding this, Abunä Yoḥannǝs finished his time trusting in her, undefeated by his enemies. And on the day of his rest, she revealed to him words of prophecy. He reported (them) to his children, saying to them, “The Arämis will come and destroy all the Christians and lay all the churches waste. You will not oppose them; you will not be able to (even if you want) because they are authorized by God. Only flee peradventure you will be saved”. He said this and rested from the toil of this world by the prayer of Our Lady Mary.

1011,The forces of iman Aḥmad Graññ at Däbrä Zämäddo.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),,,"Twenty-one years after Abunä Yoḥannǝs rested, his prophecy was at hand. The Arämi came and the Christian people fled. When the Arämi came to Däbrä Zämäddo and entered its fence, they saw the water that streams from the top of the cliff to the pavement of the church. The Arämi approached the water from below wanting to drink (it). The water fled in the direction of the betä lǝḥem through the middle of the cliff. They surpassed it to the betä lǝḥem, and the water returned back through the middle of the cliff and came to the top of the door of the hall. When the Arämi saw, they encircled the water, with some of them being by the betä lǝḥem and some of them at the top of the fence. It fled from their faces hither and thither. It was also suspended in the sky. The sound of the water was heard, but it did not come down. They did not get a single drop. All this happened so that Our Lady Mary may show her power. She made even the water flee hither and thither. Our Lady Mary did all this to show her power. And when the Arämi failed to get the water, they wanted to enter into the shrine. But Our Lady who made the water flee and made it so that they would not get it, sent insects that bite with their teeth and sting with their tails, lest they enter the shrine. She drove them away with such a miracle. After that they did not come back to this place. No one of the Arämi or Christians entered (it). It remained closed until the years of the Arämi had passed, (and) Śǝʿǝlä Adḫǝno returned from where the people who fled from fear of the Arämi had taken it, because they had taken it to another country. The work of Our Lady Mary is amazing. What would it look like if you analyzed it? It is amazing everywhere. She took Śǝʿǝlä Adḫǝno to another country and hid it there from all evil. As for the three tabots, she neither brought them down from their chairs nor brought them out from the shrine. The tabots of God stayed alone. The names of the three tabots are: two of the three are each a tabot of Our Lady Mary [and Jesus]; the small one is of Abunä Bärtälomewos; it is the first (to be here). But the two big ones were blessed here. The tabot of Our Lady Mary and the tabot of Jesus are of Abunä Yoḥannǝs. Ever since they entered into this church, they never left (it) for another country, be it for consecration or fleeing. But the wholly amazing Our Lady Mary, Bearer of God, keeps some where they are and saves some where they fled. Everything she does is amazing. The power of her salvation is admired very much. There is no other explanation. May her prayer and petition save us from the traps of our enemy forever and ever. [Amen.] Getatchew, Haile, 1st ed., 2013.

1012,The icon Śǝʿǝlä Adḫǝno exiled to Ruḥa.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),,,"When it was the time of the persecution, the people of the monastery left, carrying a few of (the monastery’s) books, as many as they were able to carry, and went to other countries; nothing is known about their status. But they left her icon in the city of Ruḥa, alone; no one stayed (with it) to keep it. As for the numerous and heavy books, they left them at the mouth of the cell, outside the shrine, which is on the left as one enters the shrine. Listen, my brothers, to the news the like of which has not been heard before this time! And see the power of the miracle of Our Lady Mary and her amazing deeds that have not been seen before, if you find the mind to know and evaluate her wisdom, to pursue her love manifested in the many kinds of salvation of Our Lady Mary! The cave, which we said they put the books in, is not dry but is a spring of water; also (water) comes down on it from above; and it drips from its side in all directions. The cave in which the books had been is not dry even during the season of Ḥagay, to say nothing of the season of Krämt. What does this thing look like – the presence of ink and parchment in the middle of water for about 50 years? Lest our minds doubt and we think the story looks like a lie, behold, here are the books called Sinodos, Qälemǝnṭos, Mäṣḥafä Bǝrhan, and Mäṣḥafä Mǝsṭir, whose brightness looks like the stars of the sky. There are also many others that were found with them. We also see the cave always dripping water like the sky during the season of Krämt. What do the story and deeds of this miracle look like? It has not been heard before – ink and parchment living in water, with the color of the parchment not spoilt or changed, and the letters not mixed with its pair! This miracle which Our Lady Mary worked at Däbrä Zämäddo is strange. If we hear the Holy Scriptures, (they tell us) that formerly Moses divided the Red Sea with his stick and put it asunder, (and the same) Scriptures tell us that the children of Israel passed on dry land. They do not tell us that they lived in the water. If it was God’s will, they would have lived in the water, but God forbid. God (wants) it to be known that he saves people in different ways. Therefore, he let them pass on dry land and brought them where they ought to settle, because their settlement was elsewhere. But the Red Sea he prepared and made the final settlement of the Egyptians. Let us come back to the case of the books about which we said were in the water, and leave the story of the Hebrews, for our interest is not in the Hebrews but in Our Lady Mary who worked this miracle for the sake of the salvation of man. (She will save) anyone, if his heart is firm in trust in her, saying, “She will save me, too, as she saved the property of her house from the destructive water”. If anyone says so and his heart is firm, Our Lady Mary, who does all this, has no interest other than in the salvation of man. (That is why) she made the water flee and made it run hither and thither. Furthermore, she made it not spoil her books until the time of tribulation was over, (which was) about 50 years. For God was angry with the Christians and (so) authorized the Arämi to occupy (Ethiopia). Furthermore, let us return to what Our Lady Mary did: Regarding the people who lived in (the monastery) but were not restricted by the rules of her (house), she scattered them to other countries. Had they been restricted by her rules, she would have preserved them together with her books, as God had preserved Baruch and Abimelech who lived observing his law when the Children of Israel, who committed too much lawlessness, were taken into captivity. In regards to the people of Our Lady Mary’s household, too, she did not let them remain in her house before, but expelled them and dismissed them to wherever they wanted. We do not know their end either. But us, O our brothers, let us pray to Our Lady Mary, Bearer of God, lest she make us like them. May her prayer and blessing be with her servant Gäbrä Maryam forever.

1013,The icon Śǝʿǝlä Adḫǝno recovered.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),,,"Listen! Let us tell you a miracle which Our Lady Mary worked when she willed the return of her icon to Däbrä Zämäddo, for they had left it in the city of Ruḥa: She talked to a certain monk, who was a God-lover and her lover. He was living in Däbrä Azäzo, coming from Däbrä Libanos. The name of the monk was Habtä Śǝllase. She said to him, “Take me home. For I have been in Däbrä Lalibäla since I left my country”. When the monk heard the words of Our Lady Mary, he rose up quickly and went in haste to where she directed him. He arrived at the church  of  Mary, called  ʿAmdä  Bǝrhan, and inquired about and searched for the news of the icon, of its coming formerly and its presence there. He inquired with the noblemen who had survived there. They replied to him, saying, “We were not here before because we are strangers. We have not heard any news that it came from elsewhere, nor   do we know of its presence here”. (The monk) was shocked and was saddened very much. He was depressed for his coming from far. He said, “My toil was in vain. This must be the work of my enemy. No one else would do this”. He said this and cried bitterly. He fell on the ground and rolled himself, saying, “How would the enemy appear in the likeness of My Lady?” Saying so, he cried and lamented. Because of his excessive sorrow and his crying, he was exhausted. He leaned against a wall and had a short sleep. At that moment, Our Lady Mary came to him and said to him, “Do not be sad. For your coming was not of Satan, but of the good will of God (which) brought you and made you reach here. I am, indeed, here”. She said this and directed him to the place where she was. She said to him, “Open that window, because I am in it”. When he heard the words of Our Lady Mary, he rose up from his sleep and went to the window and opened it quickly. He found (the icon) Śǝʿǝlä Adḫǝno in it. He rejoiced very much when he found it, because what Our Lady told him was the truth, not a lie (from Satan). He took it out of the window, carried it and took it to its country. As he traveled, he came to the top of Ǝnǧafat at the juncture of two roads, one that went toward Ǝnǧafat and the other that went toward Yägär Laʾlay. When he came to the juncture of the two roads, he rested a while. At that moment, Our Lady Mary said to him, “Rise up quickly and take the road on the right that goes toward the monastery. Do not tarry here because a black dog is coming by the road on the left. Pick me up quickly lest it pollute me by touching (me)”. He heard and took the road she directed him to take. After he walked (a distance of) three miles, one of his servants said to him, “Let me go back to where we had rested, because I forgot something (there). I will go and bring it”. (His master) said to him, “Behold, do not go (back); let it be left. Behold, (Our Lady) had told me, saying, ‘Rise up  quickly. A dog is coming; let it not pollute me by touching (me).’” Although his master told him this, he refused (to listen) and went back to where he had left his thing because the man was originally a violator of orders. He did not listen to the words of others. He did not do but what his mind thought, because his look was black. The house of his origin was from the race of Ham. When he came to where he had left his thing, as he picked it up, the Arämi, which Our Lady Mary called a dog, and (because of which) told (the monk), “Pick me up quickly lest it pollute me by touching (me)”, found him. The Arämi killed the servant on the spot. Listen, our brothers! If a habit – however it happened – is established, and people say, “The behavior of so and so is such”, it never separates from him even for a day, but brings him to such a destiny. And his end is the Hell of fire. Let us go back to the story of the icon: (The monk) brought her to her home with much search, herself guiding him and keeping herself. May her prayer and petition and the mercy of her beloved Son be with her servant Gäbrä Maryam forever and ever. Amen. Getatchew, Haile, 1st ed., 2013.

1014,The icon Śǝʿǝlä Adḫǝno stolen.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),,,"A miracle which Our Lady Mary worked at Däbrä Zämäddo after Śǝʿǝlä Adḫǝno was returned from where she was exiled: The people of the (royal) camp and the people of the palace heard the news that Śǝʿǝlä Adḫǝno was present at Däbrä Zämäddo, working wonders and doing astonishing things to hear, and that the art of its beauty was startling and fearful to see. It is not right to compare it with any icons made by the hand of a human being. I am not sure it was made by the hand of a human being. I think it was rather made by the hand of God. For it is not impossible for God to do this, because he is the bringer of the worlds and the creator of angels (out of nothing). It would not be impossible for God himself to create it, rather than authorize a human being (to paint it). When the people of the (royal) camp heard about this power she worked and how the art of her image was stunning, they sent a thief to steal the miracle- and wonder-working icon of Our Lady Mary, Bearer of God, and take it to the camp. The thief came to Däbrä Zämäddo and entered the shrine by night. He found Śǝʿǝlä Adḫǝno; he picked it up, carried it, took it out of the shrine and set out through the road he thought was the road that would bring him to the camp. But Our Lady Mary guided him to where she wanted, and brought him to the field where the worldly people assemble on her feast day to watch her icon. People had formed a huge crowd, and (the clergy) entered the church to pray and lift incense, and at that moment, (they noticed that the icon) was missing from its chair. The clergy shouted immediately, and the people of the monastery assembled. They roared and blew the horn. The people of the country heard and all came out and were dispersed to the four corners of the earth, on horses and on foot, wanting to search for it and restore it. At midday, someone went to the field to search for his own concern, not to search for (the icon), but for his own concern. He went to the field which we mentioned earlier, saying, “The worldly people assemble in it on the feast day of Our Lady Mary to watch her icon”. When the man got there, he suddenly (and) unexpectedly found the thief standing and his legs tied with a rope of miracle – which is stronger than iron fetters, although it is not visible to the eye – and carrying the Lady of us all. The man who found the thief shouted. The people of the monastery heard and assembled by him, where the Lady of us all was found. The horn was blown, and there was much jubilation. Mourning was removed and the clergy danced and sang, thanking God and praising the Lady of us all. At that moment, the people of the monastery and the people of the country held counsel to execute (the thief). Some said, “Let us not execute him, but amputate his hands and legs”. And some of them said, “Let us execute him”. But the tender-hearted Our Lady Mary, Bearer of God, revealed the judgment to the abbot. The abbot said, “As for us, let us let him go. We did not find him by our search or wisdom. Our Lady Mary, Bearer of God, delivered him into our hands, binding (him) with the rope of miracle. If she wants his execution, executing him is not impossible for her. And if she wants to let him go, she knows (what to do). But on our part, let us let him go wherever he wants”. They decided on this and released him. He went wherever he wanted. Listen, my fathers and brothers! This miracle which the icon of Our Lady showed and the judgment she passed on the thief was not a judgement thieves deserve, but a judgment of peace makers, as the search (for the icon) and theft had happened because of strength of love for her. If we compare this incident, it is similar to what she did at Ṣaydnāyā and the judgment she passed in favor of the Afrǝngawi. When this Afrǝngawi was in his country and when he travelled for his business, he heard the news about the icon of Our Lady Mary, that it was in Ṣaydnāyā in the house of Märina (an icon) which works wonders and sheds sweat until it drips on the ground, and with the sweat it heals the entire world. And the art of her appearance was amazing to describe. When (the Afrǝngawi) heard all this news of the icon, he abandoned all the worldly desire in his heart and went quickly to it because his mind had been burnt by her love. He planned to enter their (community) looking like a pilgrim and a way- farer and as if he would live there until the day of his death. He planned this, not to live there but for a cover until he would find a way to steal it and take it to his country. And the people of Martha received him in innocence as it is meet for brothers to receive strangers quickly. They let him live with them in peace. They did not know the guile in his heart – that he came to steal. And the Afrǝngawi did not know that theft was an offence. Rather, he only looked for a way to find (the icon). When he was unable to get it, after he lived there many days, the enemy made him think of another ruse to steal half of its body. He let his hand into an opening of the hedge and cut off with a knife half of its body. At that time, much blood was shed. His hands and clothes were smeared with blood. At that time, when he saw this miracle, he was frightened and shocked. He fled, lest they kill him. As he was fleeing, a man met him and saw that his clothes were smeared with blood. He said to him, “Whom did you kill, was it a righteous man?” The Afrǝngawi said to him, “I did not kill any one, neither righteous nor sinner, but I cut off the icon of our Lady Mary”. The man heard and took him to others. The whole world assembled and counseled to execute him. Our Lady Mary said, “Do not execute him. For what he has done was not with violence and malice. He rather did this because of his much love for me”. Saying so, she let him be left so that they may not execute him. As for the cut off part of her body, she ordered them to join it to where it was cut off. When they joined it to where it was cut off, the piece of the body was glued quickly. The trace of the knife could not be found. But the blood did not fade. It is there, smeared for a sign of where it once was, close to the picture of Our Lady Mary. That which is seen like blood (on the panel), where the picture is, is not paint but blood about which we had heard before. The icon which was in the house of Martha is this same one which is in Däbrä Zämäddo. The one that the Afrǝngawi cut off is this icon of Our Lady Mary which is in Däbrä Zämäddo. The one that saved the Afrǝngawi, lest they execute him is this same icon of Our Lady Mary which is in Däbrä Zämäddo. As we heard before how, in Ṣaydnāyā, she saved the Afrǝngawi from death, similarly, we saw in Däbrä Zämäddo, how she saved the thief. The one in Däbrä Zämäddo is that of Ṣaydnāyā. The one of that time is the same one which is there today, and the one which was cut off is (also) the same one. The piece of body that was glued when they joined it is the same one near the picture of Our Lady Mary. The one that was cut off is the same, and the one that was glued is the same. Look how its body parts are smeared with blood. We brought you this news. Accept it with your ears and put it in your heart. If you believe in Our Lady Mary, that it is possible for her to do all this and you take refuge with her help, you will be saved from all destruction, O worldly man. When Our Lady Mary shows all these miracles, she has no desire that benefits her, but only trust that her power is to save people. May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved Son be with her servant Gäbrä Maryam forever and ever. Amen. Getatchew, Haile, 1st ed., 2013.

1015,Fountain of honey sprang under the feet of Abunä Bärtälomewos.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),,,"A miracle which Our Lady Mary worked for Abunä Bärtälomewos: After he brought the tabot inside the grotto, he made his standing place outside the grotto on the top of the rock which is very dry. One day, as he was standing, she caused white water to spring from under his feet. Its taste was like milk. Listen, my brothers! Everything Our Lady Mary does to her beloved ones is wonderful and amazing. This miracle deserves admiration and praise. When Abunä Bärtälomewos saw this miracle – the water turning white – and drank from it, its taste was like milk. When Abunä Bärtälomewos saw this, he said to his Lady, “If you have done for me what has not been done before for other saints, I beg you – say, yes to me – to change the appearance of this that you caused to spring from under my feet, into water, and its taste to be in accordance with its nature. This that happened today, if its appearance and taste become normal, will not benefit my children. Let (the water’s) taste be natural, so that the people of the country may not have it robbed from them and the rulers keep it for their own need. However, let not your help be ever removed, so that it may be a hope to my children”. And Our Lady Mary, Bearer of God, accepter of the petition of all, did for him (what he asked): she made the milk water. May the prayer and blessing of Our Lady Mary, Bearer of God, and the power of the covenant (given) to Abunä Bärtälomewos keep Gäbrä Maryam forever and ever. Amen. Getatchew, Haile, 1st ed., 2013.

1016,The oppressive ruler of Dänägäz.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),,,"A miracle which Our Lady Mary worked during the time of Abunä Yoḥannǝs on the feast day of Abunä Bärtälomewos, (the first) abbot of Däbrä Zämäddo: People gather together on his memorial day to perform the feast because it was ordered formerly that people who are under the dominion of Abunä Bärtälomewos gather together to perform a feast. Those who were appointed under his office and people from the four corners of the land are gathered together to share the blessing of Our Lady Mary, Bearer of God, because they watch her icon on the day of rest of Abunä Bärtälomewos. For people who are gathered together (for the occasion) find two benefits: one comes from taking refuge with the saints, and the other is they report to the officer the news of their condition, whether or not the ruler rules them with hardship and oppresses them. They would tell him the misfortune inflicted on them. And (the abbot) on his part would pray to Our Lady Mary (on their behalf); and Our Lady would hear him immediately and remove for them their sorrow. Accordingly, the people of Dänägäz, who were among the people who gathered together on this feast at the time of Abunä Yoḥannǝs, reported to the latter the news of their oppression, because the ruler had tormented them very much. When Abunä Yoḥannǝs heard, he summoned the ruler and asked him to lighten the yoke of the poor. The ruler heard and said to him, “Alright, I will do what you told me. And you will reconcile me with them tomorrow, but today it is already evening; release me to go to my lodging”. When he released him, with this excuse, he left quickly the same night, and arrived at his country in the morning. For he was angry with Abunä Yoḥannǝs and the poor, saying, “Who of these poor will ever dare to come to my country? For they have accused me (of oppressing them) at the abbot. And which abbot can order me? I will not allow myself to be ruled by the abbots any more. And my feet will not come to this monastery (any more), nor will my eyes see it”. He arrived at his country as he murmured these words and announced (his decision) to the whole country. Those poor people told Abunä Yoḥannǝs that (the ruler) had left during the night. He said to them, “You, too, go (home)”. They said to him, “Our mind would not even think of it, not to speak of doing to it, (because we know) how the ruler would treat us”. When Abunä Yoḥannǝs heard, he went to Our Lady and told her the mockery of the ruler, and as the Scripture says, “The prayer of the righteous is capable and empowers”. And Our Lady Mary heard his words immediately. She said to him, “Tell them, ‘Go immediately; do not tarry so that you may see the power of my Son and the power of my miracles given to me.’ For the prophecy of this arrogant ruler has arrived. He has said, ‘I will not come to Däbrä Zämäddo anymore.’ For this prophecy of his has been fulfilled for him”. When they heard (this) from Abunä Yoḥannǝs, they left and arrived at their country in the evening of the same day. They found the people of the country coming together (and) burying him. They arrived and inquired about what happened to him. The people said to them, “He came slandering Abunä Yoḥannǝs, and, regarding you, counseling with his angel of counsel, the Satan, the father of lies, saying, ‘I shall not let those who accused me at the abbot in my country. Let me see, if the abbot can save them from my servitude.’ He also said, ‘I will not let myself be ruled by an abbot any more. And I will rule people with hardship, if I want. I will make them like the kwahat of the gate of the city. And if I want, I will scatter them, so that they wander in another country. And in regard to Däbrä Zämäddo, my eyes shall not see it anymore.’” He arrived as he murmured these words. But before the words of his mouth – false accusation and slander – were finished, sudden death came upon him, because Abunä Yoḥannǝs had complained to Our Lady Mary against him. And Our Lady Mary, because she knew his demeanor, sent upon him the cup of death to fulfill the words of his prophecy, because he had said with his own mouth, “I shall not see Däbrä Zämäddo, and I will not let myself to be ruled by its abbot”. She fulfilled for him what he wished. For there is no servitude for man in flesh after death. He mindlessly prophesized his passing away because he had said, “I shall not see Däbrä Zämäddo”. Listen, my brothers! And understand this incident, lest words of arrogance, false accusation and slander come out of your mouth, so what found this violent man will not find you. Gǝlyanos, too, when he showed arrogance toward Basil and Gregory, when he slandered them and appointed for them a day for (their) torture, she sent Mercurius, the martyr of the Son, to requite (Gǝlyanos) with the requital due to his violence and the requital of his arrogance. The same happened against this violent man, too. Because he had been arrogant toward Abunä Yoḥannǝs and the poor people of his country, she sent on him a sudden death. May her prayer and blessing be with her servant Gäbrä Maryam forever and ever. Amen.  Getatchew, Haile, 1st ed., 2013.

1017,The three monks who thought of leaving Däbrä Zämäddo.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),,,"A miracle which Our Lady Mary showed on the water she caused to spring up from under the feet of Abunä Bärtälomewos: When she first caused it to spring up, its color was white, and its taste was like milk. When Abunä Bärtälomewos prayed to her, she changed its appearance and made it like water. After Abunä Bärtälomewos had rested, there were – among the people who came together for silence, who depended on Our Lady Mary, Bearer of God, and who were born of Abunä Bärtälomewos in cap – three men, monks, who lived in brotherhood and (were bound together) with the rope of love. They did not want the toil of others, but fed on their owen manual work. Their manual work was working the farm field. With this, they were devoted to prayer. And in church, too, they served day and night. Whatever happened, they were never late in lifting incense and the Communion. They were assiduous for Godly work and strangers to vain matters. People never accused them of any evil thing. To the contrary, they praised them with good praise. After they lived in this order for many years, one year, their supply became short. They sowed their farm fields, fighting so many difficulties. When the month of Säne came and their grain was finished, the brothers counseled to go to another country – where there is (good) harvest – and spend the rainy season there. As they set out to go, Our Lady Mary distracted them with an idea, lest they leave on that day, because she did not want their departure because they were her beloved ones and attendants of her house. She brought them an idea and they discussed (it) among themselves. They said, “Let us not go today, because we have eaten yesterday. What would we reply to Our Lord, if we did not spend a night fasting. Today there is, indeed, not a single seed in our abode. So we will spend the night fasting, and tomorrow we shall go where we intended to. It will be proof for us if Our Lord asks us in the mouth of any person, saying, ‘Why did you leave your cell before you spent a night fasting?’ It will be right for us for answering. Let us spend the night fasting. We can go tomorrow”. They spent the day in accordance with this counsel. In the evening, she made them think to fetch water from where she caused it to spring up from under the feet of Abunä Bärtälomewos, in order to do her good deed by reason of the water, because Our Lady Mary, Bearer of God, thinks of different ideas to save people using many of them. The brothers fetched water from where we mentioned before. She also made them have a thought: they said, “Let us not drink before we measure (it) because it is the property of God”. They said this and poured it in a big gourd, one cup of which would fill a person. When one (of them) tasted it, it was wonderful in his mouth, because Our Lady Mary had made it honeycomb. He finished it with difficulty. For the other two, too, it happened like it did for the first one. When they saw this, they said, “But today we have found dinner that is greater than our normal meal”. On each next day, too, it became similarly honey until the three months (of Krämt) were over, and as the monks said, “We will go tomorrow if we spend this night fasting. But today, we have found dinner that is greater than usual. How can we leave Our Lady when she has not left us? How can we leave her while she feeds us what is better than food? When Our Lady Mary, Bearer of God, herself leaves us, when this honey becomes water, at that time we will leave”. As they said, “We will go (the day after) tomorrow rather than tomorrow”, starting with Säne, they came to Mäskäräm. And their farm field which was sowed was ready (to supply food). It produced perfect ear corn. They cut from the ear corn and brought some home. They roasted it with fire, and ate until they had enough, saying in their heart, “We will drink our honey later”. (But) when they tasted the honey after they had eaten enough from the ear corn, the water returned to its former nature and became (real) water. Look at this miracle which the perfectly admirable Our Lady Mary, Bearer of God, had worked! May her prayer and blessing be for us a buffer and shield against this (turbulent) time. And may they save us from the search before her Son, Us, her male and maiden servants, Forever and ever. Amen. Getatchew, Haile, 1st ed., 2013.

1018,The three big boulders that ripped off from the cliff.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),,,"A miracle which Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, worked at Däbrä Zämäddo: There is a mountain above the church of Our Lady Mary. Three big boulders broke and ripped off and came down in the direction of her church, following each other. The first came down by the left of the betä lǝḥem, damaging nothing. But the second hit the betä lǝḥem, as the properties of our Lady Mary with which the clergy worked in the betä lǝḥem, were in it. When the wall of the betä lǝḥem was hit, its side was shattered, with only some of it remaining. Its roof as well as the majority of its wall went way down. The wall was scattered way down. The roof of the house, too, was scattered and crushed. The boulder is the one that is (now) at the gate of the church. O my brothers, see and listen to this miracle which Our Lady Mary works! When the wall of the house was shattered, and when its roof was scattered, not one of the properties of Our Lady Mary in it, with which the clergy worked, was damaged by the strike of the boulder. See this miracle! Are not a wall of a house, built with many stones and much mud, and a roof of a house, of much workmanship, stronger than a (clay) griddle and (clay) jar and all that were made like them? Everything would have perished, if they had not been saved by the power of God. The mighty is not saved by his/its might; and the weak is not destroyed because of his/its weakness, because God keeps him/it with his Bearer, Mary, the redeemer of the world. Compare this matter which Our Lady Mary worked. Although all are her properties, she destroyed the mighty and saved the weak, lest we say, “The mighty is saved by his great might”. And the weak is not destroyed because of his weakness, if he puts his trust in God and in Our Lady Mary, his Bearer. Regarding the third boulder, it followed the (other) two. When its coming was in the direction of the shrine and when Abba Bäʾaminä Ǝgziʾabḥer came out of the shrine and saw it bouncing, comeing down, he excommunicated it before it landed and adjured it saying, “By the prayer of Abunä Bärtälomewos and by the power of the help of Our Lady Mary, and by the mercy of Our Lord Jesus Christ”, he said to it, “Stop where you are, and do not land”. When the boulder heard the name of its Creator and the name of Our Lady, Bearer of God, before it landed, it stopped (suspended) where it was, not to speak of coming down. Listen, my brothers, how all creatures but humans are servile to their creator! If man were like this boulder, he would have not given up without doing what he thinks. May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved Son, that stopped the boulder, lest it come down, stop for us the punishment of God, lest it come upon us forever and ever. Amen.

1019,The cliff side of the entrance to the church Improved.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),,,"Listen, our brothers! Let us tell you the miracle that Our Lady Mary worked for Abunä Ṣama Iyyäsus, abbot of Däbrä Zämäddo, because of his sainthood, his love to her, and because of his service to God, in fasting, prayer, repeated prostration to the ground and in sweat, and for being a lover of people, because he was humble. Therefore, she worked a miracle for him. The entrance of the church was by a (dangerous) cliff. People entered the church with much difficulty and hardship. They entered and exited falling and rising up. Some entered by the chapel of Täklä Haymanot. And some entered by the rump of the cliff where water dripped. The middle (area), which is (now) a field and running place (even) for the lame and the blind when they entered and exited the shrine, was a big cliff. If someone fell, he would not stand up in good health, but would be bruised and crushed. Some died. Whenever Abunä Ṣama Iyyäsus saw this, he was saddened. (As) he was thinking of what he should do, a big tree which was inside the gate of the fence, on the right side of the water of life, fell down. At that time, a thought came to him: he gave an order that people cut it into pieces; and they did. Then they gathered the pieces of wood into the ditch. And he added (more) stones and logs up to the big rock below. To his dismay, while he intended to improve, (the entrance), this, the wood and stone that he piled, made it worse. What he thought would improve (it, instead) prevented entrance because it was not leveled. The people of the country, too, everywhere, said to him, “Thinking you would improve it, you did for us what is worse”. On his part, when he heard (people’s complaints), he asked Our Lady Mary, saying to her, “Many righteous people who took refuge with you have made pavements on water and built a shrines on them. If you received their petition with your Son, and remembered their labor, for me, too, do now81 what I ask you, and level this crooked (path)”. When he asked her to fulfill (his wish), she heard his words and brought much rain in the dry season, when the heat was as in the time of Elijah. She poured the rain on the mountain. The rain was capable of moving the earth. She caused the earth to come down in one direction like a spring of water that runs in one direction. She made it not come down into the cliff but land on the pieces of the wood and the stones, and sand filled (it). And so, the crooked part was no longer (crooked). What people left crooked (the previous) evening they found leveled in the morning and being a running place for the blind and the lame.

1020,A raid of the oromo averted.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),,,"Another miracle that Our Lady Mary, who is Maryam in Hebrew, worked for Abunä Ṣama Iyyäsus when the Arämi counseled and gathered from many regions and camped at the land of Waǧa to lay waste the Christian regions of Wakat, Ṭäṭära, the low land, and Mäqdäla. They counseled against these regions and made a (military) camp because the Arämi have the tradition of laying regions waste whenever they change reign. This time, too, (they camped) because the one they called Dayyu Daba was appointed. The time for their tradition of devastation and attack is the month of Ḫǝdar, on the feast day of Saint Michael, the Archangel. They lay (regions) waste at that time. When Abunä Ṣama Iyyäsus heard that they had come together for this purpose, he rose up to fight (them), making the (prayer) Our Father his sword, with fruits of the olive tree, and making the Prayer of Our Lady Mary his spear. And he made the Covenant of Our Lady Mary his shield. Long before the Arämi arrived to fight, he would fight (them) standing before the tabot of Our Lady Mary and Our Lord Jesus Christ day and night. As the Arämi would set out to come to the direction of his country, he would hear and report to Our Lady Mary, saying to her, “How could you neglect your country, and deliver the sons of your household to the Arämi?” At that time she would send the Arämi back and disperse them, after they had set out to fight. They would go on doing so, with their heart never abandoning the fight, and (the people of the monastery) never resting (from watching). Whenever (Abunä Ṣama Iyyäsus) would hear the news of the coming of the Arämi, he would report to Our Lady Mary and she would return them and disperse them after they set out to fight. They went on so, starting in the month of Ḫǝdar, until the month of Mäggabit, with the Arämi not resting nor giving respite to our father. When Our Lady Mary saw the determination of the Arämi and their counsel to destroy her country, she drove them to the land of Adäl when they did not suspect it. And there, she requited them the requital due to the evil. She let them fall in the hands of their enemy. None but one of their twelve chiefs came back. We do not know if, of their armies, one from each country had ever survived (to bring) the news. What is known is that they were wiped out. (This) was heard by everybody. See what Our Lady Mary works for her beloved ones! If there is one who puts his trust in her, she will work for him, too. To us, too, (she will do) likewise, if we put our trust in her. For she is not biased against anyone among those who put their trust in her. She would not say about one, “I love him”, and about the other, “I hate him”. And regarding Abunä Ṣama Iyyäsus, the prayer he did, ten hundred Our Father, he had been doing (it) every day in the days of his sorrow. He defeated his enemies with this his prayer and his trust in Our Lady Mary. May the prayer and blessing of Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, keep the wretched and weak Gäbrä Maryam forever and ever. Amen. Getatchew, Haile, 1st ed., 2013.

1021,The husband who did injustice to his wife.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),,,"Listen, our brothers! Let us tell you a miracle which Our Lady Mary, Bearer of God, worked for Abunä Yoḥannǝs: There was, during the time of Abunä Yoḥannǝs, a certain man in the land of Mälko Amba. When he quarreled with his wife, his wife sent a missive to Abunä Yoḥannǝs, the abbot of Däbrä Zämäddo. She sent, saying, “What shall I do with this husband of mine because he saddened me too much and depressed me exceedingly? Should I come to you, and leave him behind? For he married (another) woman besides  me”. When Abunä Yoḥannǝs heard, he went to them. He arrived and preached to them and made them understand many spiritual matters. He reminded them of the death of the body, the death of the soul, going down into the grave and standing before the Creator. Then he made peace between them. (The husband) expelled his concubine from his house and sent her away. (The father) did this and left for his country. Five months later, when it was the season of Krämt, and the water of (the River) Ṣǝllare rose high, knowing that people cannot cross and pass over (the river) during the season of Krämt, (the man) brought back his concubine and let her settle in his house, rebuking his wife, saying to her, “Now, let this father of yours, about whom you always boast, help you”. She kept quiet, knowing that the water would not let people pass. And her husband addressed her with many abusive words, saying, “Why does not this father and teacher of yours, about whom you always boast, help you today?” Saying so, he addressed her with many abusive words. But she did not reply a word, but only poured her tears like a spring of water. And her eyes poured (tears) like the rain of Krämt. Abunä Yoḥannǝs knew this her tribulation as God had revealed it to him. “Her father” rose up immediately and entered the shrine. He prayed to, and begged, Our Lady Mary, Bearer of God, saying to her, “What should I do? This case is anguishing me. I cannot go because the season is Krämt, and the water is dreadful; it is impossible to cross (the river). Nor can I remain because the oppression of the woman saddens me. And the abuse of the man burns my heart. Does not the Scripture say, ‘The word of mockery destroys the soul like wax before the face of fire.’” When he told the case to Our Lady Mary, Bearer of God, Our Lady Mary, having heard this, allowed him to go and divide the water with his cross, and put the arrogant man to shame by his going, because he would be shocked very much when he comes to him, (and) when he sees his face. When Abunä Yoḥannǝs heard the words of Our Lady Mary, Bearer of God, he went immediately. When he came to (the River) Ṣǝllare, he blessed the water with his cross, as she instructed him. The water was divided and stood on the right and on the left. The middle became dry land. Abunä Yoḥannǝs passed through the dry land, like Joshua, the prince of Israel. Abunä Yoḥannǝs crossed (the river) and came to that violator of the law. When he saw the face of Abunä Yoḥannǝs, he became like a dead man due to being startled. And our father arrested him and bound his hands and legs. The man wailed and brought interceders. The whole country begged (our father) to release him, to forgive him totally. They adjured him in (the name of) Our Lady Mary and in the name of Our Lord Jesus Christ to release him. That was difficult for our father. They adjured him in the name of his Creator and in the name of Our Lady Mary, lest he refuse them, because Our Lady Mary’s habit is generosity and Our Lord Jesus’ habit is forgiveness. Furthermore, Our Lady Mary had shown her power to the violator of the law by his coming to him in the season of Krämt. (Therefore) he accepted their petition and forgave the oppressor for the sake of all things that Our Lady Mary had done for him, and having noticed (it). He released him of his bond when they adjured him in the name of Our Lady Mary because our father was reasonable. Because she had first received his prayer and brought him to the violator of the law in the season of Krämt, he, too, forgave him for the sake of the name of Our Lady Mary and reconciled him with his wife. See, my brothers, the much generosity of Our Lady Mary! When Abunä Yoḥannǝs prayed to her, although the water of (the River) Ṣǝllare was full, she made dry land in its middle, specifically for him, and he passed over on dry land. He came to where he intended to and fulfilled his desire. And the violator of the law was released from the iron bond in his body and soul, when people adjured in her name. May the prayer of Our Lady be a buffer and shield forever and ever. Amen. Getatchew, Haile, 1st ed., 2013.

1022,The Blessed Virgin claims the house of lady Maḫdärä Maryam.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),,,"A miracle which Our Lady Mary worked in the country of Mägdälo: Listen as we tell you! There was a church (in Mägdälo) built in the name of Our Lady Mary. Near the church, there lived a woman whose name was Maḫdärä Maryam. The woman was a chosen and honored one in good deeds. She was truly a maḫdärä Maryam, because she loved (Mary) exceedingly and served her in everything she could. She did not interrupt going to church day or night to pray to Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, for the salvation of her soul. She lived many years serving in church. After she lived many years near the church, her husband took her and moved her to another country far from the church whose distance was about 60 miles and placed her in a nice compound, because he was a ruler of the country (and could) do whatever he wanted. And his wife was a daughter of the nobility. So he placed her in a compound of his choice. After he settled her, he took a military expedition and tarried where he went. She built a tall and wide house of twin pinnacles. It was very nice; it was beautiful in its construction and foundation. Whoever saw it likened it to a church. When its construction and its fence were completed, the woman then moved in to live (in it). But her husband did not come back from where he went. He was very happy there because he had destroyed the Pagans and inherited their land. Therefore, he was very happy. Nevertheless, he was sad because it had been a while, more than ten years, since he had been separated from his wife. When his delay was too long, he slipped one day in the act of adultery. And the adulterous woman, who caused the man to fall, conceived. He had lived in abstention and no words of calumny had been heard about him before a day failed him. At that time, his wife heard that he had stumbled by a block of adultery. She sent him a missive, saying, “Do not show me your face after this, not to speak of us meeting in a way that a man and a woman do by being one body”. When he saw that the letter came from his wife, his heart burnt with the fire of sorrow, because he knew her mind, that she would not take back her word once it came out of her tongue. Therefore, his heart burnt with sorrow. He remained where he went, leaving all his children and his property because he knew her mind and that her dependence was on Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God. As this chosen one was living in her house, Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, sent her a missive, saying, “Give me your house that I may move in and live in it”. She sent many intercessors. But (the woman) refused, saying, “Where would I go?” She went on many years on this stand, and Our Lady Mary not giving up the (request) saying, “Give me your house”. The woman did not accept the words of the message. Finally, herself, Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, went (to the lady) at noon and found her at the threshold of her house. Our Lady Mary spoke to her with words of greetings. She was not wrathful because she was her beloved one. She knew her mind, that she was not a lover of money. She did not refuse any one of what one wanted, not to speak (of the request) of her Lady. She did not think about money, saying, “Let it be for me”. Rather, she gave it to anyone who was in need. If you ask me, “Then why did she refuse first when Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, sent a missive?” I, too, inform you, saying, “It was not to refuse (it) but to show the strength of her love to Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, when she went to her, and for this miracle to be revealed and every creature to hear it and admire, when they see the humility of Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God”. She begged her her house, making her the mistress although she was her maidservant. See the humility of Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God! Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God!  She is humble this much toward people, although her soul is in her hand, not to speak about her house. Let us go back to the subject which we had left. When Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, found the woman at the threshold of her house, she said to her, “Why did you deny me of your house when I sent (for it)?” The woman said to her, “Moving in, you may; but show me, too, (the house) where your good will is in which I should live”. Our Lady said to her, “Let your children be removed from my house about 10 mǝʿraf. But you, do not be far from the wall (of the church) so that you may come in to me day and night because I am attracted to you because of your love to me”. The two having made this counsel, Our Lady Mary moved into the house of the chosen one. The chosen one lived where Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, showed her. May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved Son be with her maidservant Wälättä Sara forever. Amen. Getatchew, Haile, 1st ed., 2013.

1023,Lady Maḫdärä Maryam commits suicide by hunger strike.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),,,"A miracle which Our Lady Mary worked for this chosen (woman) when she was living where she had shown her within her precinct. She lived keeping the ordinance of the house of Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God. The case of the husband of the woman was closed earlier, as she had given him up. She did not think of him again, and her children had settled where Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, had showed them. (Mary) was keeping them day and night because they were the children of her beloved one. But the chosen one did not think of them because she had held fast to the word of her Creator who has said, “Whoever has not abandoned the whole world for my sake and the sake of my Gospel …”. Therefore, Maḫdärä Maryam abandoned her husband and children, and only served Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God. And of her farm fields, she chose the best one whose crop would be ready in the month of Säne and whose grain would be 40 asfäridat. She would sow it wheat one year and barley another year. From this she would not take a single seed, but added to it. When (the crop) was wheat she would use it for bread and fetch barley for beer from elsewhere. When it was barley she would use it for beer and for bread she would think of another (source) for wheat. She did all this for the feast of Assumption. Starting from Easter Eve to the end of Fasika, she would please the clergy and the poor with food and drink. After she had celebrated (Mary’s) memorial (of Assumption) many years, her older son begged her to give him this farm field and to prepare the feast. She allowed him to make the memorial because of his great pressure. When she gave (it) to him, he abolished the preparation for the feast. At noon time on the eve of the feast day, people told her, saying, “Your son has disappeared; he is hidden from people; and the commemoration has not been thought about”. When she heard about the suspension of the feast, she went home, brought out her clothes she wears for the Communion, clothed herself (with them), stepped into her bed and called upon Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, “O Yes-Sayer! Say, ‘Yes’ to me. Come, (and) take me away, lest I see the face of the son who abolished the commemoration of the feast of Assumption”. She said this and slept, having stretched her legs straight on the bed. When the clergy gathered into church and missed her, they went (to her house), saying to each other, “How did she stay away on the feast day, she who would not interrupt going to church on normal days and was never absent from her standing place?” When they arrived, they asked the people of her household, saying, “What happened to the lady?” The people of her household replied to them, saying: “‘Come, My Lady, to take me away, lest I see the face of my disgraceful son who has abolished your feast.’ She said this at noon and slept. Her voice has not been heard after she said these words at noon”. When they (tried) to wake her up, she was found dead, as her husband had been a witness, when she sent a missive to him, saying, “After this, I shall not see your face”. At that time, he had cried bitterly because her word was one. Our Lady, too, took her, as she ordered her because she knew her mind, and there would be no change in her words. See this miracle which Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, worked! If those who are caught by severe illness ask her for life, she would raise them up immediately after they had come close to dying. And if they ask her for passing away, she would take them away immediately. She does all this because of her love for people. Other desire she has none. This woman gave an order to Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, because she knew that she loved her very much. And Our Lady took her immediately. May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved Son be with her servant Gäbrä Maryam forever and ever. Amen. Getatchew, Haile, 1st ed., 2013.

1024,The storm that engulfed the country with total darkness for four months.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),,,"A miracle which Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, worked: Listen as we tell you! There is a church built in the name of Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, in the country of Śǝmrätä Ab. And there was a certain monk who lived within (the precinct of) this church, who never left the fence day or night. He was devoted to the work of God and bound with the love of Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God. During his time there was too much grief in the world. When God was wrathful at his creatures, he covered the earth with cloud and (torrential) rain until the grain harvest was lost and the entire crop of the farm lands was ruined. When people suffered tribulations exceedingly for about four months, (the monk) went into the shrine and prayed to her quietly, saying to her, “How do you keep silent although you know the weakness of man? Why do you keep silent although you are our intermediator?” He said this and left the shrine with what Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, made him understand. He said to the cloud, “Be removed!” When he said to it, “[Be removed,]” it was removed; the earth brightened and the sun came out. People could not believe it (was the sun) from the moment they saw it until it was dusk. They did not think they knew it before, because the cloud and (the torrential) rain had made them suffer tribulation by want of light and because they had suffered tribulation from cold. Therefore, they did not think that they truly saw the sun, thinking the fog would come back. But the tender-hearted (Mary) removed (it) for them by the prayer of the just, as the Scripture says, “A country is saved by the prayer of a just person”. Therefore, when the monk prayed to Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, she reconciled the world with her Son and removed the destruction. May her prayer and blessing be with her servant Gäbrä Maryam forever and ever. Amen. Getatchew, Haile, 1st ed., 2013.

1025,The child Qwǝrbanä Dǝngǝl and the leopard.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),,,"A miracle which Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, worked for a certain child in the land of Gǝbṣawit who was called Qwǝrbanä Dǝngǝl because she loves whoever is named after her name and because her Son, too, has given her the Covenant to save him. Therefore, she kept the child. One day, his mother ordered him to keep a calf. The child went to the field, taking the calf. He spent the day playing with children. In the evening, he came home; but the calf remained in the field. When he came home, his mother asked him, saying to him, “Where did the calf remain?” When she asked him, he went back to the field, but he found a leopard. He took it home beating it with a stick. He brought it to the gate of the fence. When the child was late, his mother came out to look for him. As for the leopard, whenever it came to the gate of the fence, it would be shy to enter the gate and would flee to the field. Every time it fled, the child would overtake it and beat it on its face. It was never angry, but only fled to right or left. When the mother saw the leopard removing itself and the child beating it with the stick, she said to him, “My son, leave it alone. It will come later on its own will”. The child did this in ignorance. But his mother knew that it was a leopard; she did not reveal its name, lest the child be shocked by hearing its name. See, our brothers, this miracle that Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, worked – that she worked on this child! Because the child was her trust, she did this beating of a leopard so that the power of her miracle may be revealed, although the nature of a leopard is wrathfulness. It would attack even when they slander it, not to speak of beating it. It would wound, destroy and abolish the memory of even an adult who is armed with shield and spear, not to speak of a child. As for the child, because his trust was in Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, (the leopard) did not charge him with what would commensurate the beating. It just proceeded walking and came until the gate of the house in order for the power of her miracle to be revealed. May her prayer and blessing be with her servant Gäbrä Maryam forever and ever.

1026,The young Qwǝrbanä Dǝngǝl saved from an attack by the Arämi.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),,,"A miracle which Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, worked on this child: When he grew up and reached the age of going to school, (his parents) gave him to a teacher. As he learned, he memorized the mälkǝʿ of Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God. Having memorized it, he never recited it in silence, but by shouting loudly and in singing, from its beginning to its end. Just as the clergy perform it in church, he, too, would perform it everywhere, shouting it loudly. Wherever he went he would be identified by his shouting, when he would say, “Sälam, sälam”. He never rested from calling her name loudly from the time he went out to the field in the morning (for work) until he came back (in the evening). As many years passed, everyone knew his manner through his shouting loudly. There were Arämi in his neighborhood; these happened to look for him to kill him. When he cut wood they would follow him, but they could not find him. When he sat down, putting (the pieces of) wood together to tie them, they would encircle him. When they heard his loud shouting, they would say to each other, “What is this? Does he howl from underground? Lest we say he is in the sphere, his voice is heard (here) from the time he goes out to the field until he comes back”. He would never keep quiet from shouting, and the Arämi would never rest from looking for him. (Only) evening would separate the two. The Arämi would go back to their region and tell everyone what they had seen and heard. And when they would meet any one of the Christians, they would inquire into the matter of the shouting, “What is there in your region whose shouting looks like that of a human being, but his body is not visible to the eye? He does not do his shouting in only one place either, but he moves round hither and thither. And we would follow him by hearing his voice, thinking we would find him. When he rests, too, we would search for him diligently. At that moment, his status would not be known. (That is,) his status would not be known, whether he was under- ground or above ground. But his shouting would go on very long. And we would toil much, thinking we would find him”. When the Christians heard, they admired, saying, “The one who shouts loud is Qwǝrban and the shout is the glorification of Our Lady Mary, and his disappearance is because Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, keeps him and hides him from the eyes of killers”. This miracle that Our Lady Mary worked on the man was amazing to the Arämi and exceedingly admirable to the Christians. May her prayer and blessing be with her maidservant Wälättä Yoḥannǝs forever and ever. Amen. Getatchew, Haile, 1st ed., 2013.

1027,The tree that wrecked havoc on the church.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),,,"A miracle which Our Lady Mary worked at a church built in her name in the country of Śǝmrätä Ab. The church’s precinct is very beautiful. Around the church there are (trees) that look like branches of cedar. They looked like a built wall. One of these trees widened and thickened very much. The mass of its thickness was like a small house. Its height, too, became big; it became higher than the church (building). Because of its too excessive height, it leaned toward the shrine and was on the verge of crushing it. When the clergy noticed (it), they rang the bell, and the people of the country – men, women, the old and children – assembled. They saw how the tree had leaned toward the church. They were saddened very much because the construction of the church was beautiful. They said, “What should we do with it? If we cut it at its middle it will fall on (the church) and demolish it. Nor should we leave it, behold, it is loaded on (the church) and will eventually demolish it. We are troubled on all sides. Let it be (as is); let us pray to the owner of the house because everything is possible for her”. They said this and held rogation at vespers, with broken heart and much tears. After they held the rogation, they said to her, “O mighty one, do what is best”. They said this and returned to their (respective) homes. And when the tender-hearted Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, saw their great sorrow, that same night she turned (the tree) backward. Its top went out of the fence. When day broke, people gathered to pray to her. But they found (the tree), having put its top outside the fence. They rejoiced with great joy. They named Our Lady Adnanitä ʿOm.

1028,The three adulterous priests.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),,,"Let us tell you a miracle which Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, worked. Listen, our brothers, to an amazing and wonderful thing that happened! There was a church in one of the countries of Ethiopia built in the name of Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, during the time of our Metropolitan Abunä Marqos. There were three priests who served in the church that we mentioned earlier. The enemy made (these priests) stumble into the act of adultery. (As a result), one begat three children, the second begat two. The third did not, but he did not stop committing adultery. They lived in this deed like an Arämi, but on the other hand, they were called priests and Mass celebrants. They were also called people of the household of Our Lady Mary. As for the people of the country, although they knew their (sinful) deeds, there was none, not one, who would say to them, “Why do you do this?” When Our Lady Mary saw that there was no one who was zealous for the law of God, she instigated the sinners themselves to reveal their sin, and she to reveal her miracle on them. (It happened) one day, and the day was the day of Bǝrhan, and the people were gathered in the church (for the occasion). As these sinners were still in the beta lǝḥem, and the time to start the celebration of the Mass was at hand, the celebrants spoke to each other, saying, “Unless people tell us our deeds, declaring whether good or bad, we shall not celebrate Mass”. When the people of the country heard the matter, they said to each other, “We do not know the duty of priests, lest we pass judgment on Mass celebrants”. (At this time) the sinners committed transgression publicly, because the enemy had stiffened their heart: they said to the people of the country, “Be excommunicated, if you do not reveal our deeds”. When the people saw and heard that they had excommunicated them, they said, “If you excommunicate us, let us tell you: you have begotten three (children); and you have begotten two (outside marriage); and you are a regular adulterer”. When these sinners heard, they said, “Now that you have told us our deeds, we will not celebrate Mass”. They said this, and buried the Communion in the ground under the altar after it was celebrated. When the people of the country saw the spoilage of the sacrifice, they took (the three priests) to the metropolitan. They came to the metropolitan and told him their concern from the beginning to the end. When the metropolitan heard and knew that what they told him was believable, he demoted (the three) from the rank of priesthood. He next brought up a point, saying, “Why did you keep silent when they sin against God, when it is not ordered in the law that sinners celebrate Mass?” The people of the country said, “What could we do? There is no other priest in our country. Therefore, we kept silent”. The metropolitan said to them, “Cancellation of the Mass is better than sanctification of the body of God in the mouth of sinners”. Furthermore, he said to them, “Have you not heard what the Scripture says, ‘Whoever is adulterous with his body is like one who sacrifices his blood to Satan’. Our Lord, too, has made us understand, saying, ‘Five dogs become one with those which are condemned to be outside’. One of these dogs is the adulterer”. The metropolitan brought them other evidence as well. He said to them, “Now tell me: Was it not because of adultery and merrymaking that (God) was angry in the time of Noah and brought the flood? Was another sin found? And was it not because of adultery that he brought down fire on Sodom in the time of Lot? The flood and fire devastated the world. But God kept the saints, Noah with his children, and Lot with his children, because they did not go along with the sinners. Why did you keep silent when the body of the Creator is oppressed, and the house of his Bearer is called the house of adulterers? It would be hated if an act of adultery was heard even against lay people, not to speak of touching the body of the Creator by the hand of a sinner (and adultery is heard) against priests”. He taught this and said to the people of the country, “Go to your respective homes. Find a priest and (re)consecrate (the church of) Our Lady Mary”. They said to him, “We cannot find one”. And he said to them, “Let her, who has expelled them by their own admission, find one”. When they came back, heaven was torn apart and a thunderbolt came down and rent the roof of the shrine. The clergy were thrown to the ground. Then they later stood up and searched for the Communion. When they searched for it, they found it being two. One (of them) was the one that was prepared for the day, and the other was the one that was buried before – (they were found) the first being on top (of the second). At that time, Our Lady Mary, Bearer of God, brought them a thought: They said to each other, “Let us celebrate the Mass with this one, and let the one from earlier stay aside, and let us take it to the metropolitan”. When the metropolitan saw, he admired and wondered. He divided it in three parts. He kept the two parts for himself and the other part he gave to the clergy. The metropolitan said to them, “Know and understand this matter and the miracle which Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways Mary, Bearer of God, worked. And hold unto this miracle firmly”. He said this and wrote it down. He ordered the adulterers never to dare touching the body of God. He (ordered) also that people make this miracle a witness like the Book of the Rite. May her prayer and blessing be with her servant Gäbrä Maryam forever and ever. Amen. Getatchew, Haile, 1st ed., 2013.

1029,The righteous monk who was afflicted by bugs.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),,,"A miracle she worked for the holy fathers and pure brothers. One of them was their father and an abbot, devoted to practicing the acts of the saints. He never left the church of Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, neither during the day nor the night. Worldly concern never crossed his mind. He never paid attention to food and drink either. And his cover was of goat-skin. As he lived devoted to Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, bugs underneath his cover tormented him. He was embarrassed to show them (to others). At that time he called Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, and said to her, “Bring me birds. No one else can deal with it”. At that moment, she brought him what he asked her and fulfilled his desire. See, our brothers, the humility of Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, and her saying, “Yes” to anyone who one asks her. May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved Son be with her servant Gäbrä Maryam forever and ever. Amen. Getatchew, Haile, 1st ed., 2013.

1030,"“Keep yourself from minor things, lest you fall from big things”.",Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),,,"A miracle which Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, showed to the monk for whom she brought birds and arranged his house: He had disciples who attended him. His cell was near the church of Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God. Above it, there is a big cliff whose top is far for the eye. It has no path that would take one up (to the top) and bring one down. Its height is raised very high, and its breadth is wide, a walk of half a day. At the top of the cliff, there is the farm field which the disciples worked. Their behavior was very good. And Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, loved them very much, seeing the beautiful art of their (good) deeds. Due to her too much love (for them, she decided) to give them respite from the hardship of the road, because they had toiled too much in going round the cliff until they came to their farm field. When the tender-hearted Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, saw on one hand their devotion to serving in her church and on the other to working the farm field of their teacher with humility and love, she, therefore, authorized them and made them to be like the angels of God. When they went out toward their farm field, they walked up on the cliff, and when they returned toward their home, they went down on the cliff without using a rope, like Däbrä Damo, as a means of ascending and descending the cliff. They did not make a ladder either as other people do as a means for ascending and descending a mount or cliff. These holy men did not think of such means because they were given wings from the Creator and Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God. With the wings, they went out to the field and came back along the middle of the cliff. One day, as they worked their farm field, the enemy shot its arrow and stung the heart of one of the monks with the love of money: As he was working, he found a needle. (The enemy) brought him the thought of not revealing it to his brothers, keeping it by his waist. He placed it there as (the enemy) instructed him to, because the enemy had started to make him accustomed to quibbling with people.  Mar Isaac says, “Keep yourself from minor things, lest you fall from big things”. Therefore, the enemy tested him with a needle, to cut him off from the membership in the body of the saints. On that day, in the evening, they came to the edge of the cliff. His brothers went down to their home as they were used to. But the owner of the needle remained at the top of the cliff. His brothers said to him, “Why are you not coming?” He said to them, “Come, I will inform you”. When they went, he said to them, “Look at my disgrace. Because of this needle, I went down from being an angel to being below people. But (please) forgive my sin and ask Our Lady to restore me to you as she returned the angel to his former status because of the prayer of Abba Samuel of Qalamon. (Please) pray to the Lady of us all. And think about this sin and keep it in your heart so that it may be an admonition and a lesson for you, and (to be evidence) that what John Chrysostom has said is true. For he has said that there is no small or big sin. All keep one far from God. Just do not sin”. When the brothers heard this, they prayed to Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God. And on her part, she accepted their prayer and made him as before, and restored him to his brothers.

1031,The punishment for cutting trees from the church’s precinct.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),,,"A miracle which Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, worked at a church built in her name in the country of Śämro: There was a certain priest who served in her church. The man was skillful. He was also versed in the Scriptures. He did all sorts of manual work. For his manual work, he cut her trees. And Our Lady told him, “Stop. My heart does not love people who cut my trees”. He refused to obey. He did not stop cutting. And he told everybody her words which she told him. After he refused obeying her, she asked faithful people, saying, “Please, relieve me from this man”. But them, too, he refused. After that she brought on him a mild admonition. She started to make his iron tools disappear. They never stayed over a night, whether he had them made (for him) or acquired (them) or borrowed (them) from people. What the man did was not only for himself, but also for others. When he built their houses, he would suggest to them to cut (the trees from there), be it for a beam or a shutter. For whatever it was, he would not give her respite. The loss of the axe did not admonish him either. Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, having seen this, changed admonition to burning the house with fire. The fire, whether arson or one that started in their house, however it happened, would burn (the house) down. She would not let stand a single year anyone’s (house built with wood) cut from her precinct. With this, too, the man and the people of the country were not admonished either, because the enemy had thickened their hearts. When Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, saw the stubbornness of their hearts, she said to the man, and she informed the people of the country, saying to them, “This man will not live in my country; and he will not be buried inside the fence of the church”. The man went to another country. When the time came, he said, “Do not bury me inside the fence”. He said this and put them under anathema, lest they bury him inside the fence. He was buried outside the fence in the path of cows. This happened so order that the words she had told him might be fulfilled. Although he was a priest and bishop, he was buried outside the fence. Because Our Lady had said to him, “You shall not be buried inside the fence of the church”, her words that she told him have been fulfilled. May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved Son be with her servant Gäbrä Maryam forever and ever. Amen. Getatchew, Haile, 1st ed., 2013.

1032,Chewing the body of the Son of the Blessed Virgin is not welcome to her.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),,,"A miracle which (Our Lady) revealed to a certain monk whose name was Ṭimona who lived in the country of the east. She informed him of the anguish in her heart, as her Son, the Savior of the World, informed Ṭimona when he was disappointed by Mäbaʾa Ṣǝyon. He had said to him, “See, Ṭimona, what Mäbaʾa Ṣǝyon has done. When my heart burnt by his love, I spat my spittle on his clothes so that I may not be separated from him day and night. [But he lent his clothes to someone else.] Now see this matter!” Ṭimona heard and called Mäbaʾa Ṣǝyon and said to him, “Why do you lend your clothes to others? Behold, the Lord himself has told me his sorrow”. Mäbaʾa Ṣǝyon said to him, “Yes, I have done (so), when people forced me to”. He said this and rolled on the ground. He said to (Ṭimona), “What will be of me after this, if my Lord is disappointed with me?” Ṭimona said to him, “Do not despond, my son, because Our Lord is merciful. Only let us pray to him”. He said this and made peace between them and reconciled them. Our Lady, too, knowing that Ṭimona was a beloved one to her Son, asked him, saying to him, “What should I do, and what will be of me? My mind shivers and my heart melts like wax before fire when people chew the flesh of my Son with their teeth. What shall I do with this my Son? First the Jews crucified him on a wood and pierced him with a spear, and now people chew him with (their) teeth”. Ṭimona said to her, “What should people do? Your Son has said, ‘Eat my flesh’, and now you inspire fear in me. What should we do?” Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, said to him, “Let them knead it with their palate and tongue like a grape. Chewing, however, is not right”. Our Lady said this and kept silent. When Ṭimona heard, he said, “This sin would be a sin of bishops and priests, if they prepare (the Eucharistic bread) solid like a stone. Let them prepare it soft like a cluster of grapes that would be easy for the palate and tongue to knead. If this is chewed, it would be a sin of the laity”. Hold unto this miracle firmly and keep it in your heart. Do not consider it a fiction and idle talk, because Our Lady does not talk idle, but tells about the life of the soul. May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved Son be with her servant Gäbrä Maryam forever and ever. [Amen.] Getatchew, Haile, 1st ed., 2013.

1033,Abbot Maḫdärä Krǝstos who left his office on his own volition.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),,,"A miracle which Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, worked at Däbrä Zämäddo: There was a certain monk whose name was Maḫdärä Krǝstos who loved Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, and who served in her church. When they appointed him bishop for her church, he upheld its orders and laws, and pleased the people of her household. He even left his office on his own volition, not demoted but while people begged him, saying, “Do not leave your office, because you please both God and people”. But he said to them, “(Please) let me go; when the time in office is prolonged, negligence will prevail. At that time man quarrels with his Creator”. He said this, and left his office. When (the monk) grew old, he thought of his passing away and started digging his grave outside the church, very far from the church. Since Our Lady does not forget her love to whoever loves her in faith, at that time, she sent him a missive, saying to him, “Why do you dig outside? Will you not be buried inside the shrine?” The man said, “How would I be buried inside the shrine when I am a sinner and filthy? How would I be buried in the dwelling of my Lords?” He said this and persisted in digging. The messenger of Our Lady Mary said to him, “Your toil (in digging) will be in vain”. Next, he made a prophecy to follow: “If you rest before me, I will bury you inside the shrine, where My Lady has shown me. And if I die before you, she herself would know”. The monk finished what he started, and lived many years. He became like children in innocence. He came to a state he did not distinguish good from bad. He forgot even fasting and prayer, lest he put people under excommunication, saying, “Bury me where I have built (my grave)”. When he rested, brothers buried him inside the shrine, on the right of the altar, because Our Lady had directed earlier there the man whom she sent, saying to him, “Why will you be buried far from me? For you are my beloved one”. Her words were fulfilled as she had told him. O brothers, see the amount of her love! Whether one served her a little or loved her much, if his mind went astray, she will bring him back to the inner side of her house. And if one despises her words a bit, and disregards her precepts, she will keep him far from her precinct and blessing. O Our Lady, may your prayer and blessing keep us, the children of your household; And make us partake in the banquet of your Son. And may your sojourn in Qwǝsqwam be a guardian to us. Forever and ever. Amen. Getatchew, Haile, 1st ed., 2013. Voices from Däbrä Zämäddo: Acts of Abba Bärtälomewos and Abba Yohannǝs 45 Miracles of Mary, pp. 243-244. Harrassowitz Verlag.

1034,The density of trees of the precinct of the church that prevented the sun.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),,,"A miracle which Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, worked at a church built in her name in the country of Śǝmrätä Ab: Listen, my brothers! Let us tell you the miracle she worked, just as her Son worked for his beloved Mäbaʾa Ṣǝyon. (At that time) when a woman came to (Mäbaʾa Ṣǝyon), carrying her sick child on her back, and said to him, “Take this child and heal him by your prayer, and let him be your servant”, he said to her, “I myself am a servant of My Lord. How do I accept a servant? But give him to his Lord, the Savior of the World”. The woman heard and said, “Let it be as you said”. At that time he put in (the child’s) mouth crumbs from (the food prepared for) the memorial of the Savior of the World. At that moment, (the child) vomited what looked like charcoal and scorpions. After that, when he recovered (from vomiting), he became well. One day, as he and his brother were asleep in one bed, embracing each other, both covered with one blanket, the house was on fire at midnight. Those who heard went out and fled from the fire. The (two) children remained – because sleep had killed them – because they did not hear. The next morning, the people of the country gathered with the father (of the children), and cleared the (other) ash to bury their ash. They found them; they found the trust of Our Savior alive, but the second was found being ash. Look at this miracle! Our Lady Mary, too, showed (a similar miracle) in her church which we described earlier, saying, “The construction of the church and its foundation were beautiful”. Its trees were many, very dense and tall, higher than the church (building). Because of their excessive height, they prevented the sun from entering the fence of the church. People who came to church said to each other, “If we cut the branches of the trees, Our Lady will be angry with us. And if we leave them so, when they drip water in the season of Krämt, they would wear out the church before its time. And in the season of Ḥagay, every leaf of the trees comes down on the church. This (too) would wear it out. We, too, when we come out after service, could not find the sun inside the fence. We do not find sun, unless we go far outside the fence”. They lived on saying (so) to each other. And Our Lady Mary, as she is a lover of people, caused fire to start in the field, far from the church, to fulfill (people’s) wish and to reveal the power of her miracle. This Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God – because she is saddened when people are saddened and hears them quickly when they pray to her – brought the fire quickly to her precinct. It met with its trees. Every tree present in the compound of the church was burnt down. The charcoal came down on the church, and the flame was repeatedly moving hither and thither above the church. The people of the country wailed from far, saying, “How did you do (so), Our Lady? Because of our sin, you burnt down your own church and the tabot named after your name. How did you put your own church on fire while all your property is in it?” Saying so, they spent the night, starting at three in the afternoon until morning, and the trees burning. In the morning, people came close to see the condition of the church; they found it well. None of her properties was burnt save for the trees which prevented the sun, which were like a canopy over the church and would wear it out by their drips before its time. As for the charcoal which was cut from the trees and dropped on the church, its ash was found becoming a pile. When they cleared the ash, they found the straw (of the roof) well. Even its color was not changed, not to speak of it being burnt. See this miracle! While fire burns wet trunks, it does not touch dry grass when the power of Our Lady prevents it. May your prayer and petition save us, too – as they saved your church from the fire – From the love of the world, the snare, Which looks permanent, although it is like a shadow. Forever and ever.

1035,The man who refused to observe holy days.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),,,"Let us tell you a miracle which Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, worked: There was a certain man during the time of Zäwäldä Maryam. The man was, indeed, Christian in name, but in deeds he was outside the Christian law. His home country was below Wägrä Sǝḫin, the city of the saints. Although he lived in the city of the saints, he never participated with the saints in deeds; he rather lived in the deeds of the Arämi. He knew neither fast nor prayer nor any order of the church. He did not obey the clergy either. When they said to him, “Today is a holy day” or “Today is the holy day of Our Lady, it is not right to work (on it)” – when they said (so) to him – he would ridicule them. When one day, on 3 Gǝnbot, the holy day of Our Lady’s entrance in the Temple, he went out to work the farm field, the clergy said to him, “It is not right; it is forbidden, lest her holy day be abolished”, he mocked and went out to the field. He spent (most of) the day plowing. At 3 o’clock, (a whirl) wind with a storm rain started. It spun the man (in the air) where he was working and dropped him down with his oxen, as he held the plow in his hand. When he landed on the wide field, the earth opened its mouth and swallowed him up with his oxen. He became the likeness of Dathan and Abiram. See the power of Our Lady which made him like Jezebel, the origin of arrogance, daughter of Beliar, and like Läyabo, the blasphemer!

1036,The greedy man who did not observe holy days.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),,,"A miracle which Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, worked (against a certain man) who lived between the two Mount Sǝḫins: He was a lover of money. Although his money was a lot, he never felt that he earned a single seed of grain. Also his farm fields, which he farmed in many countries, were plenty. With this his toil, he did not give respite to the weak. And he never offered to the church even a bit, neither for sacrifice nor incense that would be for the salvation of his soul. To the contrary, if he found any church property, he would take (it) for himself. Because of his too much love for money, he abolished holy days, thinking he would earn plenty. One day, on the holy day of Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, he sowed his farm field. On the holy day of the Holy Trinity, too, he sowed while people told him not to. He again sowed his farm land on the holy day of Our Mother Saint Hannah. He refused and sowed while people told him not to. When harvest time arrived, and when (the grains of) this farm field, too, was ready to be cut, Our Lady brought locust, and the whole country was troubled. They held rogation. The locust left the farm fields of the people of the country because they were not sowed on her holy day. The locust did not devour (anything) but the farm field of the violator. See what Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, had done! In that farm field not (even) gleanings were found. It became as if it were not sown. And also the money in his house was lost, with no fire consuming it or a robber robbing it. And his cattle did not come back from the field to which they went out but were destroyed where they were. After all his property was lost, his wife died, and he remained alone with too much misery. His age of vigor, too, passed away, and he became (too) old. See the power of Our Lady! She allowed the earth to swallow one miser, and she made the other live (long) on the earth to experience devastation and hardship. Since (this man) was a boaster by his might as well as money, she made him remain alone to know his limits, that he was weak. May her prayer and her blessing and the mercy of her beloved Son be with her servant Gäbrä Maryam forever and ever. Amen. Getatchew, Haile, 1st ed., 2013.

1037,The righteous Wäldä Ḥawaryat whom the Blessed Virgin comforted.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),,,"A miracle which Our Lady revealed and spoke to a certain monk called Wäldä Ḥawaryat: He came from Däbrä Libanos and lived in Däbrä Zämäddo in seclusion. He was versed in the Scriptures and was practicing them. He was truly Wäldä Ḥawaryat. One day, he entered the chapel of the icon of Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, to mourn, remembering the crucifixion of her Son, because this was his habit. Whenever he remembered the sufferings of the Son of God, his energy would be weakened and his bones would be crushed. His tears, too, would come down like water from a fountain; and they would flow from his eyes like the rain of the time of Krämt and run down to his waist and reach his feet. The ground on which he stood would be wet with his tears. One day, as he was crying, Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, said to him, “Wäldä Ḥawaryat, why do you shed so many tears so that the ground is wetted?” He said to her, “O My Lady, I remember the sufferings of your Son”. And she said to him, “Was my Son crucified for you only? Was he not crucified for the whole world?” She said this and disappeared from him. Saintly people, whom Our Lady loved, heard her and wrote down this miracle. They also explained the matter to us: They said, “The reason she said, ‘Why do you shed so many tears’ was not for trivializing (the importance of) tears, but to strengthen (Wäldä Ḥawaryat) from exhaustion and to show the strength of her love to all people who put their trust in her”. May her prayer and petition keep Wäldä Iyyäsus forever and ever. Amen. Getatchew, Haile, 1st ed., 2013.

1038,The righteous Wäldä Ḥawaryat and the glory of Maḫlet.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),,,"Another miracle which Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, revealed to Wäldä Ḥawaryat: While he was reading the Maḫletä Ṣǝge, standing before the tabot inside the shrine, the clergy started singing from their usual standing place. At that moment, Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, stood up and said to him, “Wäldä Ḥawaryat, I am going to my sons who have started the maḫlet in order to stand with them and strengthen them from their exhaustion”. Wäldä Ḥawaryat said to her, “Why do you not reply to me a word, nor strengthen me from exhaustion, although I always stand before you and recite your praises? Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, said to him, “Wäldä Ḥawaryat, do not say so. But you, when you pray, you do so standing in seclusion and in silence. Do you not see how much their toil is?” She said this and went to the clergy who performed the maḫlet. Wäldä Ḥawaryat, too, followed her to see what she was going to do. When he came, he saw her handing them sistrums and the drum. When they sweated she rubbed their faces with her scarf and with her handkerchief. And when the maḫlet was fin- ished, she collected the sistrums from their hands. She also brought the drum down from their neck with her hand. After he saw this miracle (Wäldä Ḥawaryat) loved the maḫlet, and honored it in his mind. He became a witness also before others – that singing with the drum and songs is better than glorifying and praising in silence. He, too, kept it firmly for himself. He decided not to pray alone at the time of maḫlet, but stood with the clergy who toiled. At the end of his years, he told all people the glory of maḫlet, and how Our Lady loves it when they perform it in meekness, void of haughtiness and vain glory.

1039,The thief who stole and sold the lectern from the church.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),,,"A miracle of Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, which she worked and showed her power on a thief: He stole her lectern and brought it to Maḫdärä Krǝstos, the ruler of Ṭäṭära. When the ruler saw it, he was exceedingly happy, because it was beautiful, one soaked and dyed in paint. (The ruler) gave the thief a lot of money for its price. Because of his great happiness, the ruler summoned the people of his household, men as well as women, and assembled them and said to them, “See, I have acquired what would not be found even in palaces”. One young man, whose name was Täklä Haymanot, replied to his master, saying to him, “Does not this property belong to Our Lady of Däbrä Zämäddo, which is exhibited with her icon at the honoring of her holy day, and the whole world sees it?” The ruler heard and called the thief and asked him, “Where did you bring it from?” The thief said, “I brought it from Däbrä Zämäddo”. The ruler heard and admired the power of Our Holy Lady. He said, “If I had not summoned the people of my household, and if I had not shown this property to them, who would have told me that it was the property of Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God?” All the people said, “But this wisdom is not others’ but Our Lady’s”. The ruler said to the young man, “Take this thief (to Däbrä Zämäddo), making him carry back what he had brought”. He took him, making him carry (it). When the thief came to the land of Wäsan, he bolted to flee. The young man threw his spear and hit (the thief’s) two legs with the spear. (The thief) fell down by the power of God. The young man raised him up and took him to Däbrä Zämäddo and presented him to the abbot. The abbot assembled the people of the monastery and asked them what they should do with the thief. Some said, “Let us execute him”. And some said, “Let us amputate his hands and feet”. But Abunä Ṣama Iyyäsus said, “Let us let him go. Let Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God do with him whatever she wants, as she has brought him there”. They released the thief from his binding, and let him go wherever he wanted because she has brought us her property, what else do we want?

1040,King Lalibäla and his Godson.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),,,"A miracle that Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, showed and revealed a secret to the meek, and kind like his God, the famous King Lalibäla, whose regnal name is Gäbrä Mäsqäl, regarding his son whom he begat in two ways: one is that (the child) was the son of his brother in flesh, and the other is that (King Lalibäla) was (his) guardian in the Holy Spirit. He took him from the bosom of his mother and kept him with him. When he took him from the bosom of his mother, his mother was saddened because of her separation, for the child was small, just three years old. His mother’s eyes were not satiated with seeing him. As for the child, he never ate anything from the delight of this world, but earth. Even the earth, he never ate but only on Sabbaths. The people of the country said about him, “This child, the son of the king, looks like start of the sky because he eats and drinks whatever he wants”. On this (assumption), they said, “His beauty is superb”. But the child never ate anything. He tied his waist with a goat tether. No one knew his asceticism but his spiritual father. Indeed, his father knew his secret – that he did not eat anything. One day, as (the child) was sleeping with his father Lalibäla, Lalibäla searched the child at his waist and found his waist tied with a goat tether, but it being like linen. Lalibäla lamented and cried when he saw the torment the child was under. At that moment, Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, came and appeared to Lalibäla [and said to him], “Why do you cry and break the heart of the child?” And she made a point next, saying to him, “Regarding the Kingdom of my Son, people do not find it being subservient to food and drink. Only the righteous find it when their body becomes like a dried bark of a tree and like the green mallow of the time of drought, due to too much fasting, repeated prostration to the ground, and too much starvation and thirst. People find it only this way”. Saying this, Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, made Lalibäla abandon his sorrow.

1041,The Blessed Virgin informs Näʾakkwǝto Läʾab about his future.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),,,"A miracle which (Our Lady) revealed to our King Näʾakkwǝto Läʾab (about what would happen) when he became an adult: She prophesized about him and explained to him things which would happen to him later. She said to him, “O child, the beloved one of my Son, and my beloved, too, stay firm and go on contending in this your contending, and bring to an end what you have started. Do not retreat from your toil. On my part, I shall keep you; I will not be separated from you day or night”. And she explained to him one thing related to prophecy: She said to him, “This, your father Lalibäla, will give you his kingship while he is alive. Then he will take (it) back from you. At that time, do not feel sad; have patience. Let not your heart be angry either. He will again return your kingship to you. On your part, when you receive the kingship, go hunting wild animals. (When you do), a white partridge will take off from the country of Dänsa and will enter into a grotto. Follow it, and go into the grotto. When you enter, you will find the partridge. At that time, catch it and slaughter it. And sprinkle its blood in the grotto. Let not your soldiers eat its flesh, but bury it in the grotto. After that, make a pavement there and build (on it) a church in my name, and bring in a tabot in my name”. She said this and disappeared from him. When the time (for the fulfillment of) the prophesy, which Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God prophesized, was at hand, Lalibäla gave him his kingship while he was alive. Then he took it away from him because of a cow of a poor man, which his soldiers took while Näʾakkwǝto Läʾab did not know. He was not angry when his father took away his kingship. He was neither sad nor angry because he was humble. The love of (this) world had never ascended his heart. And the words which she told him earlier were fulfilled, including everything she revealed to him when her Son sent a missive, saying, “Know your wife as Adam knew Eve, because there is a blessed child in your loin”. When he heard (the missive), he said, “How would I abolish my priesthood, while I am a partner of the Seraphim in incensing the throne of (the Lord of) the Sabaoth? I will not do this thing”. Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, said to him, “Why do you refuse to obey the order of my Son? If you do my Son’s order, neither your priesthood shall be abolished nor you virginity lost. And comfort your wife, because she would be sad about her virginity. Say to her, ‘Your virginity, too, will not be lost.’” She said this and disappeared from him. See her humility, my brothers! Although she is the Queen of Heaven and Earth, when someone is sad, she visits him and comforts him.

1042,The three monks who starved in the cell that once belonged to the Holy Family.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),,,"A miracle which Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, revealed to a certain monk whose name was Bäkwrä Ṣǝyon, where he took hermitage with his four (spiritual) brothers: People claim that Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, had lived in the cell in which he took hermitage. (It is said that) when she fled from the cursed Herod, she (first) went to Egypt and from there she came to the country of Ethiopia and lived in that cell seven months with her beloved Son (and) with Joseph and Salome. When these (four) monks heard the history of this cell – that Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, had lived in it – they led their hermitage in it, to pray to her for the salvation of their souls. They lived in it five years, combating, in much toil and affliction, because there was no food in the cell. And the desert was (too) far from people. After they lived five years, (the enemy) incited the four monks, and caused them to think (of leaving). They said, “Let us tour the desert. If we find wayfarers, we shall ask them to bless us and comfort us regarding the concern in our heart”. But Bäkwrä Ṣǝyon strengthened his trust in Our Lady. He said, “I will not look for a blessing from others, but from Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God. I will look for her blessing, if I (deserve to) find it. If not, I will die here”. He said this and remained alone. And they went to where they intended. Early next morning, as he was there alone, (Our Lady) came to him. She met him and comforted him concerning the sorrow in his heart. She said to him, “Go to the land of Lalibäla, for the Creator has ordered your grave to be there”. She said this and ascended into (fol. 149r) the heavens. And the monk went to where she ordered him. He rested there and was buried by the church of Mädḫane ʿAläm. See, my brothers, how a person with two hearts and whose mind wavers, saying, “Would I get (what I want) or would I not”, will stay away from the hope in Our Lady and the mercy of Our Lord. The other monks were separated from finding her and seeing her because of the deficiency of their heart (manifested) in looking for a hope from others. But Bäkwrä Ṣǝyon, who strengthened his trust in Our Lady without doubt, earned Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, to the end.

1043,King Zärʾa Yaʿǝqob rebuked for leaning against the wall of the church.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),,,"A miracle which Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, explained, and revealed secrets of the church to the righteous and faithful King Zärʾa Yaʿǝqob  when he entered a church: The church was built in the name of Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God. When he stood before her tabot to pray and leaned against a column, she admonished him, saying, “Why do you push me? Do not press on me!” Listen, my brothers! Comprehend this matter. Was not this column, which spoke this to him, a stone? (But) do you think that stone has really a tongue? God forbid! Rather, Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, imitator of many objects, spoke to him instead of the column. A talk by a stone has never been heard since the beginning. Until now there was not found any among the saints who talked with a stone, not one was found. However, (rocks) had sprung water for them, when they struck them. But talking (with a stone) belonged to Our Lady to explain to (the king) that it is not right (to do so) in church. She explained to him that people should not lean against a wall, sitting or standing, so we may believe her words. The construction of the ten churches by Lalibäla is evidence for us that leaning in church is not right. Now check for yourself, if you could find one (church) for which he had built a column. He avoided building columns when he realized that leaning in church is not right. He would have built (columns), if it were right. O brothers, what will she, who said to the righteous and meek Zärʾa Yaʿǝqob, “Do not push me”, do to us who spread ourselves like a board and sleep like a dead person? And when we wake up, we entertain ourselves in backbiting and in vain jest. O my brothers, comprehend the lesson of the Lady of all.

1044,Qwǝrbanä Dǝngǝl inflicted by the consequences of aging.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),,,"A miracle which Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, of Däbrä Zämäddo worked for a certain monk, whose name was Qwǝrbanä Dǝngǝl, whom she had saved before from the devouring leopard and also from a killer Arämi, and whom she had kept since his youth from every difficulty, as she also did from the snare of the enemy when he grew old and his energy had waned. One day, at midnight, (the enemy) came to the old man and said to him, “Stand up, father; let us go to church, because today is New Year. People are waiting for you. Stand up; let us go”. The old man said to him, “The night is too heavy; it is still dark. How can I go?” The enemy said to him, pretending to be one of the boys of the old man’s household, “The night is over; I will also put on a torch for you”. (The enemy) made him think that he had put the light on. So the old man said, “Alright”, because the enemy had deranged his mind. He brought him out of his house and took him in the direction of the church. Soon  they came to the juncture of (two) roads (one of which) would take one to the right and (the other) to the left. The one on the right leads to beneath the church, and it is near the church. The one on the left leads to above the shrine. The old man said, “Let us take the road on the right”. But the enemy said, “How can we enter (now through the front door)? For the worldly people are gathered at the door of the church. They will criticize us, saying, ‘How did they sleep until day break?’ Let us rather go over the church. We will enter the shrine by the betä lǝḥem, without people seeing us”. He said this and took him by the road on the left. When they came above the church, at the watercourse, the old man remembered his habit of a long time. He used to recite the Mystagogia when he rose up from sleep until he came to church. On that day he did not re- member this prayer until he came (close) to the church, because the enemy had made him forget. The old man said in his heart, “What happened to me today, that I abandoned my prayer. He said this and (started) next (to recite it), saying, “Bäʾǝtä tǝmhǝrtä ḫǝbuʾat …”.The enemy said to him, “What, other than this, your prayer, would burn me!” He said this and struck him on his neck with an iron stick, and hurled him into the watercourse. He was thrown flat down at the door of the church. Two saintly monks who were inside the shrine heard him. They thought a boulder had come down, ripped off from the top of the cliff. As they wondered, saying, “What is it that was thrown on the ground?” they immediately heard the words of Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, when she said to him, “zä-Qwǝrbanä, zä-Qwǝrbanä, my son, my beloved one, the beloved of my Son, my lyre, the fiddle of my praise, do not be afraid, because nothing evil will happen to you, because I keep you”. She said this and touched his body. And he rose up as a sleeping person rises from bed and entered the shrine. Neither the strike of the enemy nor the falling flat on the ground from the cliff hurt him at all because his Lady had touched him. May her prayer and her blessing and the mercy of her beloved Son be with her servant Gäbrä Maryam forever and ever. Amen. Getatchew, Haile, 1st ed., 2013.

1045,The monks of Däbrä Zämäddo at the verge of abandoning the monastery.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),,,"Listen, my brothers! Let us tell you the words of a miracle she caused the people of Däbrä Zämäddo to hear and she comforted them: They lived in meekness; they did not recognize the bodily nature nor were they in servitude to it. They were not interested (in anything) but in prayer and repeated prostration in worship. The men, but few, never worked the farm field. Neither did the women know manual work, but were (devoted) only to prayer and repeated prostration in worship. The men as well as the women never toiled with their bodies in search of food and clothes. Therefore, want of the body tortured them for disregarding manual work. Our Lady saw their mind going up and down, in saying, “Should we (or should we not) leave this monastery and go where food for the body is found?” The mind of some said, “It is better for us to die here than leave our country”. When Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, saw the determination in their heart, she called them with her own voice from air at noon while everyone was hearing it. The voice called them, saying, “People of Zämäddo, people of Zämäddo”. And they replied, saying, “Now, speak out; we will hear you”. The voice said to them, “Both market places are not to be found – of the earth and of the heaven, delight of the body and life of the soul. Both market places are not to be found – interest in wealth of the body, accumulating worldly property, and being (spiritually) richer than all the poor, hoping in the mind to find the delight of the Kingdom of Heaven. Both market places are not to be found”. Her voice became silent after it said this. And the saints heard and understood the interpretation of what (the voice) said, “Both market places are not to be found”. They earned the Kingdom of Heaven with their poverty. They ignored eating and drinking for the sake of the love for Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God.

1046,The leopard which dug out tombs and ate the carcasses.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),,,"A miracle which Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, worked during the time of (abbot) Fäqadä Krǝstos, when wild animals wrecked havoc, by opening tombs and eating the dead, entering the church: When the people of the country, the priest and monks, noticed, they told their father, saying, “In the evening, we leave having closed the doors of the church; and in the morning we find them still closed. But we find the tomb open, and the human cadaver is found cut off from it. Entering through where does it eat it? This thing has perturbed us very much”. A monk, called Säfane Krǝstos, said to them, “One day, as I entered into the church at noon, I saw a leopard exiting from the shrine, jumping over the chapel of Täklä Haymanot. It exited and went to the field. When Abunä Fäqadä Krǝstos heard, he said to his children, “Come, let us pray to Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, with Sälamä Gabrǝʾel mälʾak, because when our ancient fathers were very distressed, they would pray to her with this prayer. And she would listen to them quickly and remove the sorrow in their heart. Therefore, today, too, let us pray to her with this prayer, peradventure she will not ignore us because of the multitude of our sin”. He said this and recited the Sälamä Gabrǝʾel mälʾak with his children seven times. And he ordered the people of the monastery to pray with this prayer seven days. Our Lady is a receiver of the prayer of any one, and is especially definitely partial toward the people of her household. On the third day since this prayer was started, they saw the animal three times in one day, as he went round the church. On the fourth day since this prayer was started, he was found dead inside the chapel of Ignatius. See the miracles of Our Lady, how she hears our prayer and removes our sorrow! You, too, pray to her always so she may rescue us from the waves of this world. May her prayer and her blessing and the mercy of her beloved Son be with her servant Gäbrä Maryam forever and ever. Amen. Getatchew, Haile, 1st ed., 2013. Voices from Däbrä Zämäddo: Acts of Abba Bärtälomewos and Abba Yohannǝs 45 Miracles of Mary, p. 259. Harrassowitz Verlag.

1047,Wälättä Nǝgǝśt whom the Blessed Virgin saved from a raid by the Arämi.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),,,"There is a church in the country of Śǝmrätä Ab built in the name of Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God. At that church there was a woman whose name was Wälättä Nǝgǝśt. She loved Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God. She was also a lover of the poor. Her hands were open to give whatever she would get. And she never interrupted going to church, day or night. One day, she said to Our Lady, “O My Lady, I need to go to another country to take care of my needs. When I accomplish my desire, I will return here. If your heart consents, go before me and follow me because I have no helper other than you. And I have no other keeper either other than you”. She said this and left for where she thought (to go). The country to which she went was a neighbor of the Arämi. And these Arämi always fought with the people of the country to which the woman went. A few days after she arrived at that country, she went to (her) farm field because it was harvest season. The people of the country, too, went out with their many cows to harvest the crop. As they were harvesting, the Arämi came suddenly and found the Christians with their cattle, unprepared to fight. People fled immediately, but the woman remained with the cattle because she was unable to run. The Arämi took the cows as booty. They found (the woman) in the midst the cattle. They left her there and went one mǝʿraf. (Then) they returned to her and stood before her. In order that Our Lady Mary may show her pow- er with this tactic, her power prevented them from taking her captive. And it seemed to them that they had gotten a captive, lest they leave her. Therefore, they returned repeatedly, and the worldly people watched from far as (the Arämi) returned to her repeatedly. And they saw the woman standing in the middle of the wide field. The conclusion of the story is that the Arämi went to their country. They left her, although they had seen her. The appearance of the woman looked like the cluster of rose fruit and her face shined like the ray of the sun. The Arämi left her – although they had seen her – when the power of Our Lady prevented them because she does not forget what one asks her. For she had (asked) her before, saying, “Keep me where I went”. Therefore, she kept her. And the woman came back to her country, and told what Our Lady had done for her – how she saved her from the hand of the Arämi. May her prayer and her blessing and the mercy of her beloved Son be with her servant Gäbrä Maryam forever and [ever. Amen]. Getatchew, Haile, 1st ed., 2013.

1048,Abbot Abunä Sinodos whom people opposed to cut the hab tree.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),,,"A miracle which Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, worked at Däbrä Zämäddo for Abunä Sinodos who was called Wäldä Yoḥannǝs when he was appointed keeper and legislator of the law of Däbrä Zämäddo: The water that came down on the grotto used to trouble the church. It troubled it very much, starting with the beginning of the Krämt until the month of Mäskäräm. At other months, too, it would trouble it if it rained. When Abunä Wäldä Yoḥannǝs saw this during the time of his tenure, he wanted to improve the way the water streamed and to build a pavement at the mouth of the grotto. He searched for wood that would go on par with the pavement. People reported to him, saying, “There is a hab tree at the top of the mountain that can be good for this construction”. Hearing this, Abunä Sinodos went with many people to cut the hab tree. When the people of the country heard that he went to cut the hab tree, they came together and went to the tree. They found our father having arrived there. They said to him, “Unless you first kill us, we will neither be quiet nor let you cut it”. Abunä Wäldä Yoḥannǝs said to them, “Why do you think evil? Is not our church for us all as well? And is it not the abode of Our Lady Mary? How did the enemy make you think of an evil matter? Leave this matter”. Those who opposed him said to him, “Your words are not sweet to us. As for leaving, you leave, (not we). If you want to cut it, kill us first. But while we see, we will not let you cut it”. When Wäldä Yoḥannǝs heard these, their evil words, he was very sad. He said (to himself), “If I insist on cutting it, these people will clash with my people. And people could die because of this”. He said this, and having counseled with himself, he abandoned cutting the tree and left for home, saddened and distressed. See this humility of this father, and meekness of his heart and his love for people! He did not want to cut it by force. Even though he was the ruler of these people and a huge host had followed him, he chose to abandon cutting the tree. He only said to Our Lady, “See the crooked- ness of these people! What does that tree in the wilderness benefit them? Would it not be better for them, if your house was constructed?” As for Our Lady, she heard and kept silent (for the moment). She was patient for three days. When she saw these people’s stubbornness of the heart – that they neither humbled themselves nor turned from their wicked counsel – despite the fact that their father exhibited meekness, and their ruler humbled himself, she made the tree fall from its root and be divided it into three parts, without a human hand touching it. When people heard (it), they brought to Abunä Sinodos the good news of the fall of the tree from its root. And those people who prevented its cutting humbled themselves after its fall from its root, (humility) void of praise. They said to Abunä Wäldä Yoḥannǝs, “Do what you want to do”. He said, disappointed in his heart, “This praise, after the fall of the tree from its root, is not for people but for God and his Bearer, Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God”. As she moved (the church of) Däbrä ʿƎqwäna,  she moved the tree in the same fashion. But she did not damage the foundation (of the church) of Däbrä ʿƎqwäna when she moved it; she only took it from place to place; and there, she kept it firmly as before. But her moving of this tree was not for a good (reason) but for its destruction. And she cut it into such (useless) parts. And its end was not good. She made the tree fall from its root to show her power, because of the diligence and righteousness (of Abunä Sinodos) and his servitude to Our Lady Mary. Its end was not good also because of the crookedness of the people, because ruse destroys the straight path. And (the abbot) could not improve this building (using) the tree because its cutting was not done peacefully (but only) because he loved (Mary) and because of the straight- ness of his mind. She saw his love for her, and it moved it from its place; but because of the crookedness of the people, she did not accept it. And so its end was not good. If the beginning (of anything) is not with love, its end will not be good. See this miracle which Our Lady Mary worked! Lest people say about her, “She does not help her beloved ones”, she removed (the tree) from its place to show her love to Abunä Sinodos. And lest the people who quarrelled before say, “She is a lover of money”, she (arranged) that (her) people would not cut it. Therefore, the end (of the tree) was not good. May her prayer and her blessing and the mercy of her beloved Son be with her servant Gäbrä Maryam forever and ever. Amen. Getatchew, Haile, 1st ed., 2013.

1049,The woman who received the answer to her prayer through her support stick.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),,,"A miracle which Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, worked at her church built in her name in the country of Śǝmrätä Ab: There was a chosen woman there who loved Our Lady Mary and her Son Jesus Christ. She never left the church either by day or by night before the priest blessed with the concluding words, [saying, “May] God [be with you all”]. They used to give her, where she stood, one support stick out of their support sticks which they use at their standing place. They designated that stick “the stick of the woman”. When the clergy would leave the church, she would give the stick back to them, and they would put it together with their sticks. Now, this was their usual custom.  On one of the days, the woman thought to go to the place of the saints to pay homage to the place of the saints and to receive their blessing. She thought of this and prayed to Our Lady Mary, saying to her, “Give me a sign, if it is your will that I go. If it is not your will, give me a sign so I may remain”. She said this and went home. As she entered the church (precinct) the next day, she found the stick outside the wall. She picked it up, wondering, saying, “Who brought it out?” She said this and brought it in with her. That day, too, she left it with their support sticks. And the next day, she found it outside and brought it in, wondering as before, and left it with their support sticks. The next day she found it (outside) as before. When this thing happened three days, she asked the clergy, saying, “Do you take the stick out?” They said to her, “No”. After this, she took a spiritual priest aside from people, and told him how she prayed to Our Lady Mary to allow her to go to another country. The priest heard and said to her, “This matter (shows that) it is the good will of Our Lady Mary. Go where you intended to. And take the stick with you. Verily, she has given you the stick”. The woman left. When she arrived where she intended to, (Our Lady) appeared to her that same night and said to her, “There are two distressed people in this country. Tell them, (saying,) ‘Our Lady Mary says to you do not feel distressed. Regarding your distress, I know about it. I will mitigate it for you, because you are my servants. I do not forget what one asks me earlier.’” After she told them this message – that she had sent her for – she proceeded to where she intended to. And they heard the word that Our Lady Mary had sent (to them) through the woman. They heard and said (with some doubt), “We will see it, if it is true!” In those days, Our Lady Mary appeared to one of the two distressed people. At noon, as he was standing in church, she arrived openly with Abunä Gäbrä Mänfäs Qǝddus, and said to him, “Believe what the woman has told you. It is true. Truly, it is my word that I sent to tell you. Today, too, I shall defend you. I shall not leave you to remain distressed”. She said this and disappeared from his eyes. See the miracles of Our Lady! She does not abandon those who love her nor ignore them. She brought the woman where she wanted (to go). And she calmed those distressed people from the disturbance of the enemy. May her prayer and her blessing and the mercy of her beloved Son be with her servant Gäbrä Maryam forever and ever. Amen. Greetings to you, you deserve praise, With the people of your household of the Monastery of Däbrä Zämäddo. You, who are in body and who are in the soul. Pray for us to Jesus Christ, That he may gather us at his hall for the New Wedding feast. Greetings to you, flowers of Bärtälomewos; And sticks of candles and oil of Abunä Yoḥannǝs, And Sinodos’s, perfume of Däbrä Zämäddo. Pray for us, our fathers, to Mary the garden, Whose womb fruited food for the soul against death. “Greetings to his home country, greetings to his monastery and greetings to his tomb”, Say to you, (Sinodos), members of my body which are bound (to you) with the rope of love. O Sinodos, who is like your teacher Täklä Amin, If you are searching for my love, let it be known by your feet. Getatchew, Haile, 1st ed., 2013.
