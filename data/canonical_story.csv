7,Däbrä Qaləmon miracles: The monk of Däbrä Qaləmon who did not fast.,,,LIT3614Miracle,"XXVIII THE VIRGIN MARY AND THE MONK OF THE MONASTERY OF ABBA SAMUEL OF KALMAN [A. Fol. 58a, 1; B. Fol. 28b, 1.] NOW there was in the great and holy Monastery of Abba Samuel of Kalman a beautiful church which had been built in the name of our pure and holy Lady Mary, and in this holy church, in the west wall thereof, was a large and wonderful picture of her. And in this famous monastery there lived a certain holy man who had fixed in his heart and mind the salutation of the Angel Gabriel unto our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, and it never ceased to be in his mouth and on his tongue. And he rested neither by night nor by day from reciting salutations to our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, and he placed his confidence in her, [and believed] that she would save him in the presence of her beloved Son. He [pretended] neither to fast nor to pray, and he made himself to appear to be foolish and weak of understanding, so that the [other] monks might not know concerning his strivings and labours; and he used to act in such a way that the monks treated him with contempt—now this was an unseemly thing for the monks to do—when they went out from the church. In the morning, at the time when the sun was rising, he ate a few herbs and beans, and to every one who spake with this monk he appeared to be mad. And he ate nothing from that time until the same hour of the morrow of that day, when he again ate in the presence of the monks; and this he was wont to do daily. Now when the monks saw him acting in this wise the matter was hard for them, and they were exceedingly sorry for him. And this monk, whom we have already mentioned, did not receive the Holy Mysteries except on three days in each year, that is to say, on the festival of the blessed Nativity, on the festival of the holy Epiphany, and on the festival of the precious Passover (Easter). And our honourable and holy Fathers, the doctors of the Church, have commanded that the Offering shall be offered up on these days of festivals of the Son at the sound of cockcrow in the night. And it came to pass that when the monks saw him eating each day in the morning before the prayer of the third hour of the day, and knew nothing about his fasting, and of how he was wont to fast until the morrow of the day when at the time of the same hour he ate [again], they imagined that he ate at the ordinary times throughout the day, and did not keep the ordinance of the monks; and they murmured greatly against him among themselves. And when the day of the festival of the Nativity of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, which is on the first day of the month Genbot (April 26), had come—now the day of the nativity of the woman who saved the whole world [fell that year] upon the day of the blessed First Day of the week—the monks were gathered together in the church to be present at the honourable consecration of the Offering for the celebration of the festival. And there was with them the holy father who was called Abba Isaac, and he was the Abbot of the monastery and the father confessor and prior, and he saw the monk whom we have already mentioned with a few lupin seeds, which had been soaked in water, in his hand, and he wished to eat them. Then the Abbot said unto the monks, ""Seize ye that monk and take from him those lupin seeds that he hath in his hand, and let two of the brethren bring him into the church and keep guard over him until the service of consecration be ended—sup posing it be possible for us to offer up the Holy Offering. Peradventure this evil habit shall be removed from him by the prayer of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, and he shall walk in the way of the monks with the keeping of fasts and prayer."" Then the monks did according as the Abbot had commanded them, and they took the lupin seeds from his hand with rude violence; and straightway the monk was enraged with those who had laid hands upon him, and he became like a madman. And when they had brought him to the church he said unto the monks who were going to keep guard over him, ""O my brethren, will ye not hearken unto the voice of your father concerning me? I am a poor and wretched man, take me unto the picture of our Lady so that I may entreat her to accept the prayer of our Abbot, and that all my hunger may be removed from me little by little."" And they told him that they agreed to do so, and they went with him to the eikon of the Virgin, and he prostrated himself in adoration before her, and said, ""O thou who dost save the penitent, O thou who art the hope of the poor and needy, O thou who art the helper of the oppressed, deliver thou me from these monks, for I can not fast until the time of the Offering."" And it came to pass that when the two brethren heard these words from him they laughed within themselves, and they heaped derision upon him. Now when our compassionate Lady knew that the whole body of monks were murmuring against him, and that they were laughing at him and treating him with contempt, she put into his heart the good thought that she would make manifest unto the other monks her mighty and marvellous acts and the faith of the monk and the confidence which he had placed in her. And at the moment when the service of consecration was half finished, and when every man had brought his mind into a fit state and collected his thoughts to hear the holy words of the consecration, the monk drew nigh unto the west wall of the church, wherein was placed the picture of the Virgin Mary, and standing up before it and lifting up his eyes he said unto her, ""O my Lady, peradventure thou dost receive my prayer, and dost accept my supplication and the salutation of the Angel Gabriel wherewith I have saluted thee ceaselessly by day and by night. I am a poor and wretched man and a sinner, and only God and man have any knowledge of me. I have thought that thou wouldst deliver me on the Day of Judgement before thy Son, and if thou wilt deliver me before thy Son, then deliver me from these monks; for [all men] know that whosoever putteth his trust in thee shall neither perish nor be put to shame before thy beloved Son."" Then he girded himself about with faith and power, and he took off his skull cap from his head, and smote the western wall of the church therewith, and said, ""O might of the Virgin Mary, deliver me."" And it came to pass that, when he had spoken in this wise, at that same moment the wall was rent asunder, and having hurled his skull-cap from his hand into the middle of the church he passed outside quickly through the opening in the wall. And when he had gone out the wall closed together again, with the exception of a small opening that was large enough for a man to put his hand into, and this remained as a memorial and a testimony of the miracle which the holy Virgin Mary had wrought; and when the monks saw what had taken place they were astonished with a great astonishment. Then the monks went out to look for the monk in all the desert places round about, and in the caves and hollows in the ground, but they found no trace of him. And straightway they sorrowed with a great sorrow, and their hearts were pained, and their Abbot was exceedingly harsh [towards them] because of the things that they had been wont to do unto him. For, when in times past they had been in the habit of seeing him every day at dawn, some of them cursed him, and some buffeted him, and some spat in his face, and others laughed at him and derided him. Now when they had seen this miracle they recognized the righteousness and the strivings of the monk, and how he had loved our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, in his heart, and how he had put his confidence in her, even as they had heard from him when he departed through the opening in the wall. And they learned that of a certainty the heart felt prayer of a pure and sincere mind is better and more honourable than the prayer of the tongue, even as our Lord saith in the Holy Gospel, ""When thou risest up to pray, enter into thy chamber, and shut thy door, and pray unto thy Father in secret"" (Matt. vi. 6). Now the meaning of this [verse] is, ""Collect thy mind within thyself""; and in that it saith, ""Shut thy door,"" thou must shut thy mouth and pray with thy heart. For the prayer of the heart in a mind that is sincere and collected is better than the prayer of the tongue when the mind is wandering about and going into another place. It is meet for a man to pray with his heart, and not with his tongue [only], even as this monk was wont to do at all times, although no one knew about it. And it came to pass that, when the monks saw what had happened, they went to the Bishop, and told him all these things. Now when the Father, the Bishop, had heard thereof, he sent and informed the Archbishop concerning what he had heard and seen in the matter of the skull-cap, which the monk had thrown into the church, and concerning the miracle that had taken place through it. And when the Archbishop had heard these things he rejoiced greatly, and he sent to the holy Monastery of Abba Samuel asking for the skull-cap of the monk, so that he might obtain a blessing therefrom; but the monks would not send it to him, for they thought that he would lay it up in his own house as a thing to be kept there for safety. So they placed the skull-cap in the store-chest of the church as a memorial of the miracle that the Lady of us all, the Virgin Mary, had wrought. Now in order that the Bishop might prepare the way for him, the Archbishop sent a message to l1im telling him to go to the Monastery of Kalman, and to bring back the skull-cap to him that he might be blessed thereby. And the Bishop obeyed the command of the Archbishop, and went to the monastery, and took the skull-cap of the monk from out of the chest wherein the property of the church was stored, and he obtained a blessing therefrom. Then he went to the wall that had been rent asunder, and he obtained a blessing from the opening that was left, and he prostrated himself three times before the picture of our Lady Mary, and he received a blessing therefrom. Then the Bishop anointed himself with oil from the lamp that was kept burning before the picture, and he departed from the monastery. Now when he had journeyed a little way on his road, and had arrived in the desert, he searched for the skull cap and found it not; and having turned back straight way he came to the monastery a second time, and he found the skull-cap in the place wherein it had been laid formerly, and whence he had taken it. Then he took the skull-cap a second time, and laid it between the folds of his apparel, and he tied it securely to his person with strips of leather. And when he had journeyed a little way he untied the strips of leather, and un fastened his apparel, but he could not find the skull cap in it; then he turned back a third time to the monastery, where he again found the skull-cap. And he took it out of the store-chest again and fastened it to the inside of the case wherein he carried his cross, and having taken it in his hand he set out again on his journey, but when, having gone a little way on his road, he unfastened the case of the cross, he did not find the skull-cap. Now when he had gone back to the monastery a fourth time and found the skull-cap there, he knew that God did not wish it to leave the holy Monastery of Abba Samuel. And the report of this thing was heard in all the borders, and in all the countries and cities round about. Glory be to God Who chose Mary, the Virgin, to be the Mother of His Son Jesus Christ, and thanks be unto His Only Son Who put on flesh of her in becoming the new man, and adoration be unto the Holy Spirit Who purified her from all unchastity. O Mary, who without stroke of hammer, or blow of chisel, Didst cleave a wall of dry stone where there passed out into the desert The man who was called Shalura, with whom thou wast well pleased, Cleave thou the back of mine enemy and the belly of him that hateth me, And take thou a new sword [to do it].

Fol. 9a, 1; Orient. 652, Fol. 2b.] NOW there was a certain Bishop in the church of Teltelya whose name was Dexius, and he was a righteous man and a fearer of God, and he loved our Lady Mary exceedingly. His mouth declared her praise, and his heart was filled with thoughts of her, and he ministered unto her with exceedingly great diligence and care; and he wrote the Book of her Miracles and History, and he ceased not to meditate upon the same at eventide and at morn. And it came to pass that when he came nigh to finishing the writing of her praises, our Lady the Virgin Mary, the Majesty of Christian people, brought unto him glad tidings openly, and she said unto him, ""Give me the Book of my History and Miracles, which my beloved son hath made, into my hands."" And she took the Book of her Miracles, and she opened it and read therein; and she was exceedingly pleased therewith. And she said unto him, ""Behold, O my beloved, thou hast toiled for me. Behold now, I am well pleased with thee and I give thanks unto thee, and the blessing of my beloved Son shall be upon thee and shall dwell in thy house, and He shall bless thy children and those that shall be descended from thee with the blessing of heaven, because thou hast written this Book for me""; and having said these words she disappeared from him. And the Bishop rejoiced with an exceeding great joy because Mary had brought him glad tidings, and had shown herself unto him openly, and had spoken unto him mouth to mouth; Miracles of the Virgin Mary and he loved her the more and his heart was smitten with deep love for her. Then he meditated in his heart and said, ""Behold, I will exalt her honour and majesty, and I will add thereunto very much more than I have been wont to do aforetime."" And he made a great festival, the like of which man had never made, in commemoration of Mary, not on the day of her glorious nativity, but before it, and he chose one day of all the days, and established the celebration of all the festival upon it, and he made regulations concerning it and confirmed it. And all the people of the city celebrate the festival unto this day according to the ordinance of the Bishop, and they keep the feast of the commemoration of Mary with joy and gladness.

Fol. 51b, 1.] IT came to pass on a certain day that three Arabs set out to sail to the country of Rif (i.e. Upper Egypt) when the river [Nile] was very rough and troubled, and the waves thereof ran high, and they fell into tribulation. In order to fulfil their desire they set out to sail there, but the waves were too strong for them, and they were unable to make headway against them, and the billows were about to swallow them up. And the Arabs, in accordance with the custom of their fathers, prayed [for help] to their false Prophet, but they did not find deliverance. And when they had abandoned all hope of saving their lives, one of them who had visited the Monastery of Kalmon, and had seen the miracles that were wrought there, cried out, ""O Mary of the Monastery of Kalmon, who didst once make intercession for me, deliver thou me. If thou wilt deliver me from drowning in this sea, I will give to thy church a camel's load of dates for the food of the monks, and the camel also shall belong to the monastery, so that it may carry whatsoever the monks choose to lay upon it."" And his companion said, ""Yea, verily thou hast done well to mention this great name."" And when their companion heard this speech he laughed at them, and said, ""O dogs, why do ye forsake your faith and make entreaty for mercy to Mary?"" And at that very moment he was overwhelmed by the sea, and a crocodile swallowed him up, but in order that the man's companions might see him, and the miracle might be made manifest unto them, the creature brought him up again and held him in his mouth. Then the two Arabs made supplication unto our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, and they came to a mighty rock, and they climbed up on it and stood up on it in the midst of the raging waves. And a ship that was passing that way came to them, and they embarked therein, and came safely to the port to which it was sailing. Then straightway the Arab took a camel, which was the finest of his camels, and having laden it with dates he brought it to Solomon, the Abbot of the Monastery of Kalmon, and to all the monks, and he related unto them everything that had taken place. Now the Arab's companion possessed many sheep, and he sheared their wool and brought it to the monks, and said, ""Take this wool and make of it clothing for yourselves, for the sake of our Lady Mary who delivered me from drowning."" And when the monks heard his speech they gave praise unto the glorious and Most High God, and they glorified our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, who is gracious and full of mercy. Thy name, O Mary, was in days of old the strength Of the Arab men when they remembered it among the raging waters. Like the man who made a mock of them, Thine enemy, O my Lady at every time and season, Shall become the food of the crocodile and of the crusher of bones. Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933.

Fol. 18a, 1.] NOW there was in this holy monastery, which was renowned in the days of the Abbuna Abba Gabriel, Archbishop of Alexandria, a certain holy monk who had lived there from his youth, and his name was Isaac, and he loved our Lady with all his might. And he prepared for himself certain work to do without any man knowing about it, and he was the guardian of the church, and the key thereof was in his hand. And after the prayer which was to be said before sleep was ended, and when the monks had gone into their cells to sleep, Isaac used to go to the church, and having opened the door he would go inside it, and stand up before the picture of our Lady, the holy Virgin Mary, which was on the western wall, the whole night long. And he would begin to say the prayer of the Gospel, and he would make three hundred prostrations before her, and say at each prostration, ""O my Lord Jesus Christ, make me to see Thy Mother""; and he continued to do this for seven years, and no man knew anything about these prostrations. And it came to pass, at the end of the seven years, on a certain night of the festival of our Lady the Virgin, that is to say, the twenty-first day of the month of Takhshash (December 17), when Isaac was prostrating himself before the picture (or, image) of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, that she came forth from her picture (or, image) and she shone with an exceedingly great splendour which was seven times brighter than lightning. And she said unto him, ""Why hast thou wearied thyself [in entreating] my beloved Son to show thee her who gave Him birth? Behold, I am the Mother of Life, the woman who gave birth to Jesus Christ; command me, and I will come to thee, and whatsoever thou desirest that will I do for thee."" And he said unto her, ""O my Lady, I beseech thee to make supplication on my behalf to thy beloved Son."" And she said unto him, ""Behold, God Almighty hath received thy petition, and He hath commanded me to come unto thee, and to fulfil thy desire; and three days hence thou shalt be where I am."" And it came to pass that, when he heard her words and saw her beauty and saw that she was crowned with light, he fell down upon the ground and became like unto a dead man. Then did she take hold of him with her hand and lift him up. And she disappeared from him into the picture that was before him. Then straightway Isaac went into his cell, and the sickness of fever fell upon him, and in the morning he called for the bishop of the city, whose name was Abraham, who chanced to be dwelling in the monastery that day, and when he came Isaac made known unto him all that he had seen. And Isaac said unto him, ""O my father, release me from all the bonds of [my] sin, for I dared to beseech God to show me her who gave Him birth, a thing for which I was unfit."" And he released him, and said unto him, ""O my son, if thou goest to God make thou mention of me, so that I may find mercy on the day of the Great Judgement."" And at the end of the third day Isaac died, and he inherited life everlasting, even as our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, had promised him. Isaac the monk, having wished and desired greatly, Saw thy beautiful face on a certain day. As thou didst speak unto him until he rejoiced exceedingly. So, O my Lady, say thou unto me,"" Rejoice, O my servant, After three days thou shalt be with me."" Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933. One Hundred and Ten Miracles of Our Lady Mary, pp. 20-22.

And he was married to a woman by whom he had three children, two boys and a girl. Now the girl was young and she was called ""Mary."" And the mother of the children died and they mourned for her. And it came to pass on a day, which was the festival of the glorious Nativity, that the two boys wished to go to the church, and they left the little girl [in the house], and they fastened the door upon her so that she might not go out, for it was night. But she wept and cried out, saying, ""Take me with you, and let me participate with you in the offering up of the Offering""; but they refused [to take] her, and they went on their way. Then the little girl went to the picture of our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, and she cried out with tears, saying, ""O my Lady, have compassion upon me and give me consolation."" And straightway our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, who maketh to rejoice and giveth consolation unto those who make supplication unto her, appeared unto the girl, and said unto her, ""What aileth thee, O my daughter?"" And our holy Lady Mary embraced the child, who said unto her,"" They would not let me go to the church to partake of the Offering on the day of the holy festival whereon our Redeemer was born."" And our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, said unto her, ""Be not sad, but come""; and she carried the child to the church, and she partook of the Offering with the folk who were enlightened. Then our Lady Mary said unto her, ""Three days hence I will take thee, and thou shalt be with me""; and three days later the child departed this life, and the Virgin Mary made her like unto herself. And a certain good, and righteous, and God-fearing man saw the child arrayed in purple and following our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, the Mother of Life, Who redeemed us, and he marvelled greatly, and he told the people concerning her.

And it came to pass that he painted a likeness of our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary the God-bearer, on a stone wall in a certain church in the country of France; and the picture was a most wonderful and marvellous piece of work, and every one who saw it was astonished at the beauty of her form, and was led to believe that she was speaking unto him. And he painted by the side of the likeness of our holy Lady, the twofold Virgin, Mary, another picture in which he showed how [the blessed] dwelt in Paradise. And he painted yet another picture of hell representing the Devil who had been cast therein, and his wicked fiends. And Satan saw him, and was filled with rage against him, and he overturned and threw down the scaffolding on which the painter was working, and hurled both the painter and the scaf folding to the ground; now the French church was a very lofty one, and the painter cried out, ""O my Lady Mary, help me and save me from destruction."" And straightway a band of light came forth from the picture of the Virgin, and she stretched forth her arm and laid hold of the man, and he was caught in mid-air by her hand from out of the picture, and he remained sus pended at a height of ten cubits from the ground ; and he remained suspended by the hand out of the picture for the space of one hour, and he was uttering cries for help. And when the people heard his outcries they came to him and saw what a wonderful thing had been wrought by our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary: then, little by little, she let the painter come down, and she handed him over to the men that they might pass him down to the ground from one to the other. And the people who saw this wonderful thing gave glory unto God Almighty, and praised our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, the God-bearer, and they said, ""Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb""; and they celebrated a great festival for seven days. And they called that picture, ""The picture that delivered him and raised him up out of the dust""; and the hand of the Virgin hath remained stretched out from the picture, just as it was when it laid hold on the painter, even unto this day, so that it may be a memorial of the event unto him that shall come after. The painter and his wooden scaffolding were hurled to the ground: As thou didst help him of old and didst straightway deliver him When he made entreaty, and [didst give him] glad ness in the place of weeping, Deliver thou me, O my Lady, O thou who art ornamented with splendour, And let the Proud One (i.e. the Devil) yearn in vain for my destruction.

Fol. 55b, 1.] NOW there was a certain priest in the city of Cairo called John Bakansi, and he dwelt in a church that had been built in the name of the martyr Markoryos (Mercurius). And the days of this man were one hundred years, and both his eyes had become blind, and he remained the whole of the previous year seeing nothing at all. And when the light of his eyes failed he began to carry out what he had taken an oath to do. Now there was in that church a picture of our Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, which looked towards the East, and after the prayer which concluded the ser vice at midnight had been said, and the monks had de parted to their cells, that priest was wont to go to the picture and to prostrate himself before it several times ; and having saluted the Virgin Mary with the salutation of the angel [Gabriel] three hundred times, he would entreat her to restore to him the sight of his eyes. And he continued to act in this wise for a whole year. And it came to pass that, at the end of a complete year, on a certain night, as he was singing the salutation of the angel according to his wont, and was standing before the picture of our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, drowsiness overtook him and he fell straightway into a deep sleep. And he had a dream, and in it he saw a most beautiful woman come forth from the picture, and she shone with a light that was seven times brighter than that of the sun. And she drew nigh unto him and took out her breasts from inside her apparel, and she pressed milk out from them upon his eyes; and then she made the sign of the Cross over him with her holy hands and disappeared into the picture. And straightway his eyes were opened, and he saw the Eikon burning with fire, and he found in his eyes milk that gave forth sweet fragrance. And he cried out, saying, ""Hail to thee, O thou who art full of grace! God is with thee""; and when the monks heard his cry they came unto him quickly, so that they might know what had happened. And the priest told them everything that he had seen, and they looked at his eyes and saw traces of the milk in them, and they laid their hands upon his eyes and saluted him. Then they went to the picture of our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, and each one of them bowed down before her, and they prostrated themselves before her as long as they were able to do so. And John the priest performed the ser vice of the consecration of the Eucharist on that day, and he administered the Holy Mysteries unto the monks and the laity. And he lived twenty years after this, and he continued to minister in the church, and he died in peace. Thou didst accept his petition and didst give him of thy spiritual milk, Wherewith thou didst unseal the eyes of John the aged. O Mary, the Virgin, daughter of the King of Heshbon, Accept the words of my mouth, and pay good heed to my cry, And moreover, incline thine ear unto my petition. Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933.

Fol. 54a, 1.] NOW there was in the country of the Greeks a certain monastery situated at a distance of about half a stade from a stream, and here there was a church which had been built in the name of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary. And our holy Lady Mary was wont to hold converse with a certain priest in dreams, and she said unto him, ""Build me a church on the edge of the stream."" And she continued to speak unto him in this wise for many years, and although he spake unto the monks and unto all the people they would not do as he wished. And it came to pass that, when they refused to build a church to the Virgin in the place wherein she wished, the church of the monastery, and the wall there of, and the cells of the monks, split asunder. Then the whole building moved down to the edge of the stream, and by the might of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the inner part thereof was made strong, and the church and the walls, and the cells of the monks, became firm and stable, even as they were aforetime, and the fair appearance of the church, and of its wall, and of the cells of the monks was unchanged. Now the monks who dwelt in that monastery were exceedingly numerous, and they were fast asleep on the night in which the church moved out of its place, and they knew nothing whatsoever about it until the following morning, when they went out from their cells and saw the stream in their courtyard, and all the monks uttered loud outcries and were astonished with a mighty astonishment. And they sent to the great folk of the city, and they all came, both male and female, and they marvelled when they saw this miracle, the like of which hath never been done either before or since. And they made a great feast, and they offered offerings and gave alms and oblations each year on the thirteenth day of the month Nahasse. Now the name of the monastery was 'Akona. Thy power was mighty and thou didst make manifest thy wonderful act. As thou didst of old remove that Monastery of 'Akona From its wretched condition and decay, O Mary, the daughter of Mati, Even so remove the glory of mine adversary by the might of thy hand, For art not thou the object of my boasting, and the object of my commemoration?

48,The rich man from Colosse who was wounded in the eye while fighting the Qwez.,,,LIT3601Miracle,"XV THE VIRGIN MARY AND THE GREEK WHOSE EYE HAD BEEN PIERCED BY AN ARROW [A. Fol. 30a, 1; B. Fol. 57a, 1.] NOW there was a certain man on the Island of Kualasyas who was exceedingly rich, and he set out in a ship with certain Turks (?) to fight against pirates who attacked him on the sea-coast; and the crew of the pirate's ship shot eleven arrows at him, and one of these smote him in the eye, and he became grievously sick and was nigh unto death. Then he said unto his men, ""Take me to my house""; and they brought him to his house. Now the ten arrows that had entered his body came out, but the one that was in his eye would not come out, and when they pulled at it, it broke and left the iron [point] in his eye. And there was in this place a certain church which was built in the name of our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, and she used to work miracles and wonders therein and to heal those who were sick; and when those who were travelling by sea and by land made entreaty unto her she was wont to deliver them immediately. And the wounded man said, ""Carry me to the house of our Lady Mary, for there is no one that can cure me except her""; and they carried him thither straightway. And they made an image of wax—for thus is the custom of the Greeks— that resembled him in appearance, and they brought eleven arrows, and stuck them into it, ten in the members of the body, and one in the eye. Now when a man was wounded either by a spear or [by an arrow from] a bow, they used to bring the spear and make a wound in the wax figure, similar to that which had been made in the man; and then, when they had made vows to our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, she used to heal him. So they brought the rich man to the church of our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, and he made numerous gifts to the poor and needy, and he gave that which was meet for the church itself. And it came to pass that, when our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, saw that the confidence of his heart was in her, she plucked the arrow out of the eye of the waxen figure and out of the eye of the wounded man in the same night; and the eye of the wounded man became once more like its fellow. And when the people saw the eye of the man and that of the figure, they marvelled at the greatness of this miracle which our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, the God-bearer, had wrought, and they praised her exceedingly. O Mary, the life of those who are sick, who didst heal the wound of The rich Greek whose eye had been pierced by a dart, As I proclaim thy wondrous deed so that men may understand thy marvellous act, Make my heart to expand with joy, and let me have health, So that after everything hath come to an end I may hold converse [with thee].

54,Saint Mary carries a dying monk to Jerusalem.,,,LIT3595Miracle,"IX THE VIRGIN MARY AND THE SICK MAN [A. Fol. 19a, 1; B. Fol. 22b, 1.] NOW there was a picture of our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, in the Monastery of the Nagadyan; and it was in the room wherein the sick lay, and it faced the East, and every morning those who were sick therein committed themselves to its protection and care. And it came to pass that there was in that room a certain man who had lain there sick for many days, and each day he used to speak unto our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, saying, ""O my Lady, thou wilt never be able to raise me up unless I can come to the city of Jerusalem and worship at the place where on the foot of our Lord stood."" And whilst he was making entreaty in this wise our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, appeared unto him by night, and said unto him, ""Be not sad, but come so that I may trans port thee to the place where thou hast longed and de sired to be."" And straightway she carried him to Jerusalem where our Lord was buried, and to Bethlehem where He was born, and to the Jordan wherein He was baptized; and straightway she dipped the sick man in the water, and she made him go to the Mount of Olives, and to Mount Zion where our Lord abode with His disciples. And she said unto him, ""Rejoice and be glad, for I have fulfilled for thee everything which thou hast asked of me, and after the Festival of the Nativity I will take thee unto myself."" And at that moment the sick man rejoiced greatly, and he died in peace, even as our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, promised him. May her prayer and her blessing, and the mercy of her beloved Son, be with our King David for ever and ever! Amen. A vine-cluster is Mary, the taste of the fruit of which is sweet, And tender is the beauty of her flower. To the place where thy Son was buried in Jerusalem, As thou didst transport the sick pilgrim who made entreaty Unto thee in firm faith to bear him thither, even so bring me thither this day! This is another story belonging to the large class of miracles in which the Virgin appeared to sick monks on their death-beds. In order to relieve their minds of fears as to their future state she promised to take them to herself, i.e. to her own heaven, presumably without their being obliged to submit to judgement at the hands of God or her Son. It is probable that the journey which the dying monk took with the Virgin to visit the Holy Places was nothing more than a vision, in which his lifelong desire was fulfilled. There are many hints in monastic literature that monks in Egypt and other countries outside Palestine considered a visit to Jerusalem and Sinai and Horeb necessary for the salvation of their souls, and some of them certainly thought that without it they could not attain to the perfection of spiritual excellence. Jerusalem and Sinai were to them what Makkah and Madinah are to the Muslims. Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933. One Hundred and Ten Miracles of Our Lady Mary, pp. 33-34.

Fol. 35b, 1.] NOW there was a certain poor widow whose husband had died and had left three daughters: the name of the first was Mary, and that of the second Martha, and that of the third Yawahita. And their mother was exceedingly poor, and lacked even the daily bread unless the people gave it unto her; and it came to pass that, when her three daughters had grown up and were of the proper age to marry, no man of that city thought of marrying them because of their poverty. Now their mother was exceedingly grieved because of this thing, and she went into the church of our holy Lady, the twofold Virgin, Mary, which was in Sen'a, and is called Tayada, weeping bitterly. And she stood up before the picture of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, and said, ""O Lady, I have brought up these my daughters until this day, but behold, I now lack by reason of my poverty the means for giving them in marriage, and I have no power to do anything whatsoever. O thou mother of orphans, remove my sorrow."" And in that same night our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, appeared unto her, and said unto her, ""This night I will take thine eldest daughter unto myself so that she may be with me, for she is a pledge committed unto me. And as concerning thy two other daughters I will send them unto Tewog, the blacksmith of the town of Makmas, who shall receive them from thee and shall marry them to his sons."" And when the woman awoke from her sleep she believed the words of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary. And after three days, the eldest daughter, whose name was Mary, died. And when the neighbours heard that she was dead they came to make her ready for burial and to bury her, and they saw that her mother was rejoicing and was not weeping at all. Then one of those who had come to comfort her said unto her, ""Why dost thou harden thy heart, and why dost thou not weep for thy daughter?"" And she made known unto her what our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, had said unto her in the vision, and they ascribed praise unto the glorious and Most High God, and unto the Virgin who had given Him birth, the merciful intercessor for the sons of men. And they buried the maiden Mary with great honour. And after a few days Tewog, the blacksmith, came from the city of Mekmas, and took the two daughters and gave them in marriage unto his sons. And he himself undertook the provision of marriage portions for them, for the sake of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, and her Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, who were with Joseph and Salome when they went to the land of Egypt. Now the history of the blacksmith is written in the Homily on our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, which is read on the sixth day of the month Hadar, on the festival of Kuesquam. O Mary, thou Queen, with all thy children Who make their boast of thee, thou mother of Israel. [Like] Rebecca The barren woman, thou didst make the woman to conceive a heavy burden, being in sore straits. As thou didst give her consolation, and didst perform her most earnest desire, Even so console thou me, and let not my prayer return unto me. Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933.

Fol. 33b, 1.] NOW there was a certain man in the country of Upper Egypt, who was surnaraed ""Badraman,"" and whose name was ""Abraham,"" and the name of his wife was ""Gera Anest""; and they were exceedingly rich in possessions, and they were perfect in every good work. And they had a daughter whose name was ""Elisabeth,"" and besides her they had no other child; and this daughter fell ill of a most loathsome disease in her body, that is to say, small-pox, and both her eyes became blind. And when her father and her mother saw the blindness of their daughter's eyes they were bitterly grieved, and they took her round to all the physicians and to all those men who dealt in magic, but they were not able to cure her. And it came to pass that when the day of the festival of our holy Lady, the twofold Virgin, Mary, that is to say, the twenty-first day of the month Tekemt (October 18), had come, her father and mother took the girl, together with many gifts, and carried her to the church of our holy Lady, the twofold Virgin, Mary, which was in the country called Dalga. Now the people of that country were wont to celebrate on that day a great festival in honour of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary; therefore the mother took her there on the twentieth day of the month Tekemt. And they went into the church and shut the door upon herself, and she stood up before the picture of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, and she stretched out her hands in the fervour of her heart, and said with bitter tears, ""O my Lady, thou mother of mercy, thou gracious intercessor, I take refuge in thee, and I entreat thee to save my daughter and to open her eyes."" And it came to pass that after she had made an end of her prayer she and her daughter straightway fell asleep under the picture [of the Virgin]. And as the daughter was sleeping with her mother, our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, appeared unto the daughter and woke her up without her mother knowing about it. Then our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, who is full of mercy, said unto her, ""Open thine eyes."" And when the maiden had opened them, the Virgin blew into them a breath from her pure mouth, and sprinkled upon her from her breasts some drops of her milk of healing and mercy; and straightway the eyes of the maiden were opened. Now our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, appeared unto her apparelled in light that was brighter than that of the sun, and then she disappeared into the picture. Then the girl awoke her mother and told her everything that had happened, and how our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, had appeared unto her, and how she had opened her eyes and disappeared into the picture; and when her mother looked at her she rejoiced exceedingly, and she uttered cries of joy in a loud voice. And the over seer of the church heard her as he was taking the bread for the Offering, and he came out to see what had happened, and he found the maiden with her mother, and she was able to see. And straightway he marvelled and was astonished, and he gave thanks unto God Almighty and to the Virgin, the merciful intercessor, who gave Him birth. And it came to pass in the morning that all the people were gathered together in the church, and when they saw this miracle they gave praise unto the glorious and Most High God. And they gave praise unto our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-bearer, and they made a great feast and glorified her name exceedingly. For the daughter of the rich man who had become blind through small-pox, Thou didst make the eyes to have light when, having journeyed to thee, she made entreaty unto thee. O Mary, thou fountain of help, who art called ""Maggedo,"" Let the king eat [with thee] on the day of the marriage, Having washed his hand in the water of thy purity. Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933.

Fol. 37a, 1; B. Fol. 37a, 1.] NOW there were in a certain city two beloved brethren who loved each other dearly, and they were skilled in the art of writing. And a certain man came unto one of them and asked him to write for him a copy of the Book of the Miracles of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, and that brother said, ""I consent""; and he began to write. And whilst the brother was writing the Book one committed a sinful act, and the devils came and snatched up into the air him that was writing the Book of the Miracles of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary. Now those devils who had seized upon that brother did not know the brother [they were to seize], and one of them cried out and said, ""Throw this man into perdition."" And that brother was dismayed exceedingly and trembled, for he thought that he was going to be destroyed. And our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, came, arrayed in apparel that was like unto the colour of heaven, and she said unto the devils who were carrying that brother away, ""Why are ye carrying away this man to perdition, for he and his brother were to write the Book of my Miracles?"" And having said these words unto them, she delivered the man from their hands, and he came down little by little from the sky and returned unto the place where he was formerly. And when the man awoke from his sleep he marvelled at the vision which he had seen, and he told his companions everything that had happened unto him, and how the devils had come upon him, and how our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-bearer, had de livered him. Then the man repented with a great repentance and saved himself from perdition. Unto thee turned from the unseemly path of error The two brethren who were wont to write thy name. O Mary, thou doer of deeds of gracious kindness, thou bloom above every flower, Before thy beauty and thy lovely graciousness The rejected brother became acceptable, and that false man pleasing.

Fol. 38b, 1.] NOW there was a certain man who was striving strenuously to become a martyr for the sake of Christ; and his name was George the Younger. And it came to pass that being in prison, having been condemned by the judges to suffer there for many days, one day he fell asleep suddenly. And on the twenty-fifth day of the month Genbot, at the eleventh hour of the night, our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, came into the prison-house in the form of a dove, and with her outspread wings covered over the place in his head where the wound was. And he woke up straightway, and raised up his hands in the air and took hold of her wings, and she flew out of the prison-house and de parted; now she was shining with splendour like the sun. And as soon as she had laid her hands upon his head George knew that he had been made whole, and a mighty strength came into his body; and he rejoiced greatly and was exceedingly glad, because she had graciously bestowed upon him health and healing. And he remained without eating and drinking for four days, because of the exceedingly great joy that filled his heart through the beauty and sweet odour of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-bearer. George was evilly entreated and cruelly beaten in prison. As of old thou didst appear unto him in the form of a white dove, 'O Mary, thou King's Daughter, thou wise one who didst embrace everything, And like a cherub didst spread out thy wings over George's wound, Even so, O my Lady, overshadow thou me with thy healing of fire.

Fol. 39b, 1.] NOW there was in a certain city called Elksus a priest who was an old man, and his name was Katir; and he lived in the church of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-bearer. And the verger of the church was an evil-disposed, ill-natured man who said unto Katir in the church, ""Thou dwellest here and dost make offerings for the Eucharist, and thou dost consume whatever offerings are made to the church; get thee gone and remove thyself from the church."" And the priest said unto him, ""O my brother, I am a poor old man, canst thou not see my infirmity? Behold, I have ministered in the church for forty years, and now my strength hath failed me. O my lord, suffer me to abide [here] because of my infirmity."" And the verger of the church was exceedingly angry with him. Then the priest answered and said unto him, ""Have patience with me for three days. The monks of the Monastery of Victor, the son of Hermanos, are coming, and I will ask them to take me away with them."" Now these monks were in the habit of coming to Elksus on the eve of the first day of the week with incense and lights. And when the priest had said these words he wept exceedingly, and said, ""O my holy Lady, thou Virgin Mary, it is now a period of forty years that I have ministered in thy church, and wilt thou forsake me this day?"" And by reason of his abundant weeping he fell asleep. And at midnight our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, appeared unto the verger of the church, and, according to the words of the man himself, there were with her two men who shone with light. And she said unto the verger, ""Hast thou no mercy? What hath this poor priest done unto thee that thou shouldst wish to drive him out of the church, and to send him away?"" Then straightway she commanded one of [the two men] who stood before her to beat the feet of the verger (i.e. to bastinado him), and he did so, and our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, said unto the verger, ""Henceforth thou shalt be a paralytic, and the priest shall be healed."" And it came to pass that when the morning had come the verger of the church was unable [to move], and he could not stand up on his feet; but the aged priest had renewed his strength and had become strong. Now this thing that had come to pass through our Lady Mary was not known until the verger himself declared the matter with his own words. And all the people who saw it marvelled exceedingly, and they ascribed blessings unto our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the Godbearer. So the priest continued to minister in the sanctuary, and the guardian continued to be a paralytic until he died. When the brutal verger of the church entreated evilly Kalatir (sic) Thou didst make his feet to be powerless until he died. O Mary, thou Queen of heaven, who didst give birth to the King, Make thou the feet of mine adversaries to be feeble, And send thou misery upon my Foe. Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933.

They were wont to bring everyone who came [to visit] the church of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-bearer, which was in that city, to pass the night with them in their house, and they provided him with the evening meal. And it came to pass that one day a certain evil-natured man, a Muhammadan whose name was Akyatar, came unto them, and said, ""Dye for me these garments and I will give you payment for the same""; and Nazib took the garments from the Muhammadan, and dyed them for him, but he took no payment from him. Then the Muhammadan said unto him, ""Ye are good Chris tian men; alas, that ye will not hearken unto our Prophet!"" And Nazib answered and said unto him, ""Your Prophet did not come unto us that we should listen unto him, but our Prophet [Jesus] did come unto the Arabs."" Then straightway the Muhammadan rose up and kissed the head of Nazib, and said unto him, ""Your testimony is true; our Prophet came only to the Arabs.""

Fol. 43a, 1.] NOW there was a man in a certain city of the Franks (i.e. in Europe) who had a lame foot, and he used to cover up his foot with cloth so that people might not know [that he was lame]; and he continued to weep and lament day and night without ceasing. And he loved to betake himself early in the morning to the church of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-bearer, which was in that city and which was decorated with gold and silver, and precious stones, and hyacinthine stone. And it came to pass one day that a great multitude of people were gathered together in that church, and the man who had a lame foot came also with them. And as they were going out, the Arch bishop came and found him near the entrance (?) of the church, and he was angry and said, ""Who hath been into this church?"" And he said unto the people, ""Come back, all of you, and do not depart""; and they all returned. Then again the Archbishop said unto them, ""Get ye out, one at a time""; and the people did as he had commanded them. And it came to pass that when the people had gone out one by one, the man with the lame foot was the only person left there. And he prostrated himself before the picture (or, image) of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, and tears flowed from his eyes, and he wept with a bitter weeping; and straightway his lame foot was loosed, and he became whole like the [other] men. Now when the people saw him they were amazed and held their peace. And the Archbishop beckoned to the man [to come to him], and said unto him, ""How long hadst thou been in that state?"" And the man replied, ""From the time that I came forth from my mother's womb my foot was in that state, and I used to wrap it up in linen that the people might not know [that I was lame]; and I used to weep by day and by night, and I made supplication unto our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, unceasingly. When I came into the church this day thou wast angry with all [the people] because of my sin, and thou didst say unto them, 'Go forth one by one,' and they came back; and the lot went forth for me and I alone was left [there]. Then straightway I bowed down before the picture of our Lady, and I wept much, and forth with my foot was loosed."" Now when the Archbishop heard him he found the matter hard to understand. And he and all the people went and prostrated themselves before the picture of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-bearer, and he ascribed praise unto God, the Glorious and Most High God, and rendered thanksgiving unto our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-bearer, who hath the power to do all things, to whom nothing is impossible, and who worketh wonders and miracles. When the man of the Franks committed himself to thy protection, Thou didst make whole his foot which was lame. O Mary, when I offer up unto thee the Offering, In my joy mingle thou not sorrow therewith, As men mingle water with the wine. Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933.

And one day he went unto the Archbishop Zacharias, and when the Archbishop saw him, he touched him and said unto him gently and graciously, ""O my brother, it is not seemly for thee to minister as a priest with this disease upon thee, unless our Lord Jesus Christ remove it from thee—for the Book calleth a man with leprosy unclean"" (Leviticus xiii. 44, 45). And when Bishop Mercurius heard him he wept much, and said unto him, ""O my father, help me with thy prayers."" Then he departed from him, and went and entered into the church unto which he had been ap pointed, and he stood up before the picture of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-bearer, and he wept, and made supplication unto her that she would cleanse him of his leprosy. And this he continued to do from the morning of the second day of the week until the ninth hour of the fourth day of the week, and he prayed many prayers unceasingly. Now at the time of the ninth hour of the fourth day of the week he became wearied, and he placed his head in a position of rest, and as he was resting he straightway fell asleep. And he saw in a dream that the hand of the picture (or, image) of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, reached out and rubbed his flesh. And he awoke immediately, and found that his body had been cleansed from his leprosy, and he rejoiced with great joy, and praised God, the Glorious and Most High God, and made thanksgiving unto our Lady, the twofold Virgin, Mary, the Godbearer, because she had graciously vouchsafed unto him mercy. Thou didst cleanse Mercurius from his leprosy, And didst heal him completely of the disease that consumed him.

Fol. 46a, 1.] THERE was a certain church in the city of Harlom (Haarlem?), and in it was a coloured picture of our holy Lady, the twofold Virgin, Mary, the Godbearer, which people called the ""Helper."" And there was among the inhabitants of the city a certain poor woman who had broken her foot, and she had nothing whatsoever of this world's goods to give to a physician to heal her. Then her kinsfolk lifted her up and brought her to that church, and they laid her down before the picture of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-bearer, and they left her there by herself and departed; and the verger of the church locked the doors upon her and she was left inside. Now our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, used to come constantly to that church, and to wander up and down therein, and to walk about in it the whole night long, and when the vergers of the church opened the doors [for service] about the hour of midnight they would find her there in visible form. And it came to pass that, on the night whereon they had left the woman with the broken foot in the church, our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, came there according to her wont, and she found her lying before her picture; and she made a sign over her with her foot and said unto her, ""Rise up."" Then straight way the woman rose up and stood upon her feet, and she was sound and whole. And at the season of mid night the verger of the church opened the doors and went in, and he found the woman standing up and he said unto her, ""What hath happened unto thee? And who hath made thee whole?"" Then the woman said unto him, ""Our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, came with her face shining with a light which was brighter than that of the sun, and her garments were perfumed with the odours of sweet incense, and she made a sign over me with her foot, and said unto me, 'Rise up'; and straightway I rose up and stood upon my feet."" And all those who saw the woman who had been healed of her sickness gave thanks unto God, Who is to be thanked and praised, and they sang hymns in honour of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-bearer, who doeth wonderful things and worketh miracles; for she hath the power to do everything, and there is nothing which is impossible for her. Thou, O Mary, didst heal the infirmity of the woman with a broken foot When she with anxious care and thought made sup plication unto thee. As the King of Israel, thy father, gave gifts unto those who were In Gath and Nobama at the time of the taking of Sichem, Even so give unto me, O Mary of Rama, the gracious gift of the Holy Spirit.

Now when the cannibal had devoured eight and seventy people among his friends, and his acquaintances, and his kinsfolk, and the men who were in his service, [victims] began to come to an end, for the men who remained had fled from him so that he might not be able to devour them; and he was left alone with his wife and his two children, and them also he ate. And it came to pass that, one day when he was walking on the road, he met a certain husbandman, and he lay in wait for him, and then followed him; and when he knew that the man would be too strong for him he left him and departed. And as he was turning away he said unto the husbandman, ""Sell me an ox, and behold I will give thee my bow which is plated with gold; take it."" And the husbandman said unto him, ""I refuse it wholly, for money and food are more useful to me; I will not give thee the ox."" Then the cannibal spake unto him a second time and said, ""I will also give thee arrows with the bow""; but the husbandman refused [to take them]. And the cannibal again spake to him, saying, ""Show me, I pray, the cave where thou dwellest""; and the husbandman said unto him, ""Behold [it] close by thee. Dost thou not dwell among the habitations of men?"" And he refused to shew him the cave, and as he was turning away he said unto the cannibal, ""Thou art of noble family, but thy heart is depraved and full of guile, and thou appearest to be like unto a rich man who hath his abode in the city of Kemer."" And the cannibal said unto him, ""Why dost thou compare me with such an one, O my brother?"" Then the cannibal took some water away in a drinking vessel, and as he was going along the road he met a certain poor beggar-man whose whole body was covered with the sores and scabs of leprosy; and he wanted to eat the poor man, but he did not like him because of his sores which were putrefying and which stank exceedingly. Now the beggar was thirsty and he begged for some water from the cannibal, and said unto him, ""Give me some water to drink, for God's sake""; but the cannibal became greatly enraged, and heaped abuse upon him. Then the beggar begged again for water for the sake of heaven and earth, and for the sake of the martyrs and the righteous men; but the cannibal re fused [to give him any]. And the beggar begged from him a third time, and said unto him, ""In the name of Mary, give me water to drink before my soul shall de part."" Then the cannibal said unto him, ""Verily, from my youth up, I have heard that she saveth by her prayers, therefore I myself will take refuge in her."" And he said unto the beggar, ""Take, and drink, for Mary's sake""; but when only a very little of the water had gone down his throat, that is to say, about a handful, the cannibal seized him, and before he was able to satisfy his thirst stopped him from drinking. Then the cannibal died, and the angels of darkness took his soul and cast it into Sheol. And our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-bearer, came unto the Son of God and said unto Him, ""Have compassion upon me, O my Son."" And He said unto her, ""What good thing hath he done for thee?"" And she said unto Him, ""He gave a thirsty man water to drinkin my name."" Then the Lord said, ""Bring forth the scales and weigh the souls that he hath devoured against the water that he gave the thirsty man to drink""; and they (i.e. the angels) weighed them, and the little drop of water outweighed the eight and seventy souls. And the angels of light who were looking on marvelled, and they gave shouts of joy because the cannibal was saved and was made to live through the entreaty of our holy Lady, Mary the twofold Virgin, the God-bearer, through whom all things come to pass. Thy love did save the evil-doing cannibal, Because the handful of water [given to] the beggar stood on his side. Vain and useless beneath the heavens [is everything]; What can benefit the children of men Without thy love, O Mary, thou Pearl? Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933.

Fol. 26b, 1.] NOW there was a certain man in the country of Fenke whose name was Barok; and he was a depraved man, and did no good thing of any kind whatso ever, and all the people hated him. But he loved our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, with a ready heart and a determined mind, and he used to keep the fast of Nahasse because of his love for her, and on the festival of her death he rejoiced exceedingly. And he was wont to make a feast for the poor and the needy, and the old and the young, both male and female. And one day certain men who hated him met him on the highway, and they stoned him, and beat him and wounded him with cudgels, until his body was a mass of bruised and bleeding flesh, but they were not able to drive his soul out of him; and although they attacked him fiercely with swords he did not die. Then Barok said unto them, ""Even if ye chop up my body into little pieces I shall not die, for my Lady Mary keepeth watch over me, and she protecteth me at all times, and will deliver me out of your hands""; and when they heard his words they all took to flight. Then Barok made his way to the priest, and received the Holy Mysteries, and at that moment the light of life rose upon him, and he died. And our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, received his soul and placed it in the Garden (i.e. Paradise) of joy, and those who had beaten him repented with tears and sorrow [and turned] to our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-bearer. As thou, O Mary, didst deliver from spears, for repentance and obedience, Barok, who was called the ""depraved man,"" and didst preserve him, Even so at all time in a state of safety Do thou preserve me, O Lady, so that I sin not, And even if I commit sin let thy mercy come to me.

Fol. 27b, 1.] NOW there was a certain deacon in the city of Rome whose name was Anastasius, and he feared God and loved our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-bearer. And he used to visit the church of our Lady, the Mother of mercy, and make pure first-fruit offerings unto her, and pay honour unto her with gifts and salutations, saying, ""Rejoice, O thou Virgin un dented, who hast given birth unto Emmanuel! Hail to thee, O thou who art full of grace, for thou hast given birth unto the Light that is before all others! Rejoice, O thou who hast given birth unto our Redeemer! Rejoice, O holy Virgin, who hast given birth to Christ and didst bring Him into the world without union with man! Therefore shall the nations bow down and adore thee, O thou who didst give birth to our Light. I beseech thee to be for me a mediator between me and thy Son."" And in this wise used he to pray in the church when the heavenly Offering was being made, and at the time of the Five Joys of Mary. And it came to pass after these things that the deacon fell sick and was nigh unto death, and the angel of death struck fear into his soul. Then our Lady Mary, the storehouse of mercy, the blessed Virgin, the joy of Christian folk, who sheweth favour unto kings, the mis tress of the angels, and the crown of the martyrs, appeared unto him, and said unto him, ""Why fearest thou with so great a fear? And why art thou dismayed? For when thou wast in good health thou didst greet me joy fully each and every day. And now, fear not, O my be loved, and let not thine heart be terrified, for no evil thing shall draw nigh unto thy body, and thou shalt not be terrified at the angel of death. As thou didst never cease [to praise me] with thy mouth, and didst greet me with joy, so likewise thou shalt find joy and be with me in the Garden (i.e. Paradise) for ever."" And when the deacon heard these words he found peace, and he thought that he would recover from his sickness. Then he awoke from his sleep and found his soul in great joy and gladness; and immediately he awoke he died, and his soul went forth from his body. And our pure Lady Mary received it in her hands, and it entered with her into the Garden of Joy, and into the place of delight and pleasure, where it would neither perish nor come to an end for ever. May the prayer of our Lady give our King David help, and make him to be girded about with power, and make him to be free from the opposition of the wicked and from the hosts of the enemy, and from the bow directed at him and from the sharp spear. O storehouse of mercy, take thou under the protection of thy prayer the soul of thy beloved one, for ever and ever. Amen. O Mary, thou Tabernacle of God, who dost protect me continually, Thou refined gold of holiness unalloyed with silver, As thou when thy servant Anastasius was lying grievously tormented by his sickness, Didst announce unto him glad tidings and didst make him to rejoice by thy words, So do thou make me to hear continually the glad tidings of peace.

Fol. 32a, 1 and 2.] NOW there was a certain poor widow who had one son, and besides him she had no other child. And every day she used to come to the church and stand up before the picture of our holy Lady, the two fold Virgin, and say, ""O my Lady, I commit this my son unto thy safe keeping, so that thou mayest guard him, for I have no other child besides him""; and in these words she used to pray daily. And it came to pass that, when her son had grown up and become a hale young man, he fell into the company of thieves, and became a robber. Now after a little time [the watch men] caught that young man and the other thieves who were with him, and brought them before the magistrate of the city, who passed a sentence of doom upon them; and [the guards"" crucified them according to the law of their city. And the mother of the young man did not know that all this had happened to her son, and as she was going in through the gates of the church, the neighbours told her, and said unto her, ""Knowest thou not that they have crucified thy son, together with the other thieves?"" And she said unto them, ""I did not know it""; and straightway she cried out with a loud cry, and she wept bitterly. And she went and stood up before the picture of our holy Lady, Mary, the two fold Virgin, the God-bearer, and she lifted up her eyes and said, ""Where is he whom I committed unto thy safe keeping? Where is the pledge which I deposited with thee, O my Lady? Behold, they have seized my son, together with the other thieves, and they have crucified him. So now, if thou wilt not deliver my son and save him, I will snatch thy Son out of thy bosom."" And at that same moment there was a great outcry, and many people came thronging into the church through the gates. Now when the widow heard the outcry, she turned round, and she saw her son coming in with the people, and she ran and embraced him. Then the people who were gathered together said unto him, ""What hath happened unto thee? And how wast thou saved?"" And the young man said unto them, ""When they had suspended me upon the wood, and were about to drive the nails into me, there came unto me a woman who was most beautiful in form, and who was shining with a light that was brighter than that of the sun, and she held back the nails so that they did not touch my flesh. Then she took me down from upon the wood, and said unto me, Get thee to the church, and to thy mother, for she wisheth to snatch my Son from my bosom in thy stead."" Then the people ascribed praise and glory unto God, the Glorious and Most High, and they gave thanks unto our holy Lady, Mary, the twofold Virgin, the God-bearer. And the woman and her son ministered in the church of our holy Lady until their death. Another version reads: It is said that there was a certain man who was a thief and a robber of churches, and that inasmuch as he was a man of evil habit and life he stole things from them daily; and all the people were lying in wait to catch him. And it came to pass one day that he carried off some of the possessions of our Lady Mary, according to his wont, and the people caught that thief, and beat him, and bound him in fetters and chains, and they planned to kill him. And he said, ""I place my trust in our holy Lady, the twofold Virgin, Mary, for whosoever believeth in her prayers shall be saved from all sorrow."" Then our holy Lady appeared in visible form to the men who had beaten him, and had laid hands upon him to kill him; and she said unto them, ""Release him."" And they released him by the command of our holy Lady, Mary the twofold Virgin, and set him free from his fetters, and all the people marvelled at her mercy. Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933. One Hundred and Ten Miracles of Our Lady Mary, pp. 98-100. London: Oxford University Press, H. Milford. XXXI THE VIRGIN MARY AND THE LADY EUPHEMIA [A. Fol. 67a, 1.] NOW there was a certain woman in the city of Samer whose name was Euphemia, and she was stricken in years and lived in great poverty. And she had one son, and besides him she had no other child, either son or daughter; and she loved this son exceedingly, and with her very soul. Each day, without fail, she was wont to go to the church of our Lady Mary with her son, whose name was Philemon, and pray to her for him, that she would take his soul under her protection, and would keep him from all evil, and would deliver him from all the distress that is set in this world. And she used to pray continually in the church, and she never failed to go there, and to pray on behalf of her son and to make supplication with a ready heart. And it came to pass that when Philemon, the son of this poor old woman, was moved by hunger and want of clothes, and poverty came upon him and he found himself in want, he joined himself to a company of thieves and robbers. And one day when he was plundering the house of a certain rich man in Alexandria, together with the thieves who were his companions, the menservants of the house of the rich man heard the noise of their feet on the third floor above, and they raised the alarm. Then the people of the city came to their help, and they seized Philemon and the [other] thieves, and they brought an accusation against him, and then they hanged him upon a sycamore-fig tree; and he remained hanging there for three days and three nights without eating food or drinking water. Now at the end of three days they told his mother. And it came to pass that when she heard this she cried out with a loud voice, and she went to the church, and called upon the name of our Lady Mary, and said unto her, ""Behold, my son whom I committed to thy care hath been cast away, and he hath been destroyed for nought. Now therefore, give me back my son, and redeem thou him by the might of thy Son; if thou lovest my son thou canst deliver him, for thou hast the power to do whatsoever thou wishest. Thou art the Mother of the Word of God Who became man through thee, and He hath delivered us from our Enemy, Satan, and He will consent to do what thou sayest, and will grant thee thy command, for there is none who can resist thee. Of His own freewill and by the good pleasure of His Father, He came and took up His abode in thy womb, and whatsoever thou askest Him He will give unto thee, O thou who art the boast of the race of the children of men, O thou who art the Bridge of the sons of men, O thou who art full of grace, God, in Whom there is neither division nor diminution, is with thee, and through the might of Jesus Christ, thy beloved Son our Lord, thou hast the power and the strength to do. Now therefore, O my Lady, if thou wilt not cause my son Philemon to come back, and wilt not bring him to me here, where shall I be able to find him? And in that I have committed him to thy care I have destroyed mine own son in mine own lifetime. And behold, I will take thy Son out of thy bosom in the place of mine own son Philemon."" And having said these words she set out to go to the image of our Lady in order to carry out the determination that she had formed in her mind. And straightway, on that selfsame day, Mary took a strong pole in the form of a branch of a tree, on the top of which was [fastened] a strong, curved knife, and she cut off the branch of the sycamore-fig tree upon which the son of the widow was hanging, and she set him free from his fetters. Then straightway the young man rose up, and went and walked among the crowd of people and arrived speedily at the church. Now his mother heard the noise of the multitude of people as they were coming in through the door of the church, and when she turned and saw her son among the people who were crowding in to enter through the door of the church, she ran towards him, like a woman who had gone mad, by reason of her exceedingly great joy at the sight of her son. And she seized him with her hands, like a savage lioness, and she hugged his neck, and kissed his mouth, and said unto him, ""O my son, tell me where thou hast been. Behold, for three days and three nights I have been dying for a sight of thy face; oh, I beseech thee to tell me where thou hast been! Who hath given thee bread to eat? Who hath given thee water to drink? O my son, tell me."" Then her son cried out with a loud voice before all the people and said, ""Behold, I was hanging for three days and three nights from a sycamore fig tree, but our Lady Mary fed me with heavenly food, and gave me to drink of the water of life. More over, she brought me down from the fig tree and sent me away, and said unto me, ""Go unto thy mother in peace."" And when the people who were there, that is to say, men, and women, and children, and old men and young men, and children and old women, heard this, they glorified God and ascribed great praise unto Him. And they praised our Lady Mary exceedingly, and likewise gave thanks unto her, and they sang hymns and praises unto the Word of God, and they cried unto Him joyfully, and shouted with gladness in honour of our Lady Mary, because of the wonderful and miraculous thing that she had done. And it came to pass that when the Bishop, Abba Benyami, heard these praises and glorifyings of Mary, he summoned all the people and made them come unto him, and then he enquired concerning the youth and his mother, and concerning the miracle which our Lady Mary had made manifest that day. Then he took the youth and his mother, and established them in his own house, and because of the honour in which he held the holy Virgin Mary he provided them with their food and their apparel, until he died. O thou beautiful Mother of the King Who redeemed us, As thou didst aforetime deliver the widow's son who was a thief, So, O Mary the Virgin, mayest thou earnestly desire my deliverance! May mine enemy [be turned back] until he gnasheth with his teeth, And send thou against him a devil that shall torture him! Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933.

153,The young man who used to bring roses to the icon of Saint Mary.,,,LIT3596Miracle,"X THE VIRGIN MARY AND THE YOUTH ZECHARIAH [A. Fol. 20b, 1; B. Fol. 242a, 1.] NOW there was a certain youth in the city of Rome (Constantinople) who was of noble birth, and his name was Zechariah; and he was handsome in appearance. And it came to pass that on a certain day he went into a church to pray, and he saw there a picture of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, which pleased him exceedingly; and his heart burned as with fire by reason of the ardour of his love for her. And he meditated within himself and said, ""What gift that will be acceptable unto her can I offer unto her?"" And forth with he took fifty roses, and made them into the form of a crown, and he fastened them to the picture over the head [of the Virgin]. Now when the days of roses had come to an end, he was exceedingly sorry, because he lacked the wherewithal to make an offering to present unto her. Then he went into the church and stood up before the picture of our holy Lady, the Virgin two fold, Mary, and said unto her, ""O my beloved Lady, thou knowest that the days for roses are passed and gone. But I wish to present unto thee [something] each day, and I will therefore give unto thee fifty salutations instead of the fifty roses."" So each day he recited the words, ""Hail to thee, O my Lady, rejoice thou with joy, for God is with thee!"" And he continued to recite these salutations each day until he grew up, when he departed unto another city. And when he was journeying through a terrible wilderness—now thieves dwelt therein and used to lie in wait [for travellers] and he was afraid lest he might fall into their hands—he remembered that he had not re cited the salutation of the angel, and he went forth into the wilderness to pray. And it came to pass that the captain of the thieves saw him and followed him, so that he might see what Zechariah was about to do. And when Zechariah had come into the wilderness he turned his face towards the East, and he lifted up his eyes to heaven, and knelt down upon his knees on the ground. Now when he knelt down, the captain of the thieves* saw a lady come down from heaven with great glory, and there were beautiful virgins with her. And they set a seat for her, and she sat down in front of Zechariah; and every time he spake a rose came forth from his mouth. And our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, rose up and took him to her bosom until she had received fifty roses from him; now the captain of the thieves counted the roses and he saw them with his own eyes. And it came to pass that when Zechariah had finished his prayer, our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, laid her hand upon his head, and having blessed him she went up into heaven with the virgins. And the captain of the thieves marvelled at what he had seen, and turned away into the wilderness. Then Zechariah turned to continue his journey, and straightway the thieves rose up against him and seized him. And the captain of the thieves said unto him, ""Tell me how thou didst send away those beautiful women, and what thou hast done with them."" And Zechariah said unto him, ""I am a sinful man, but I know nothing whatsoever of any beautiful women. But I used to offer as a gift each day to our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-bearer, fifty salutations, saying, 'Rejoice, O thou who art full of grace, for God is with thee.' "" Then the captain of the thieves made known unto Zechariah everything [which he had seen], and he said, ""From this day I will turn to repentance, and I will serve the Lady of us all, the holy woman, the Virgin twofold, Mary, all the days of my life""; and thus also spoke all the thieves. And they sent Zechariah away on his journey, and he departed in peace. And afterwards the thieves repented and became monks, and they served our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, all the days of their life. The young man Zechariah instead of fifty roses Presented words of praise when he made an offering unto thee. As thou didst deliver him in olden time from slaughter by thieves in the wilderness, Even so deliver thou me, O my Lady, and save me from condemnation, When neither gold nor white pearls [can do so].

154,The two women who were attacked by robbers on their way to church.,,,LIT3597Miracle,"XI THE VIRGIN MARY AND THE WOMEN JULIANA AND BARBARA [A. Fol. 23a, 1 ; B. Fol. 50a.] NOW there were two handmaidens of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, who gave birth to God in Bethlehem of the children of Judah; the name of the one was Juliana, and the name of the other was Barbara. And one day, as they were going to Jerusalem to worship at the Festival of the Departure of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, they were attacked in the village of Rosmaduk by thieves who took away their food from them. And it came to pass that, when the thieves had divided the bread that they had taken away from them, they began to eat it among themselves. And as each one of them put a morsel of it into his mouth and began to eat, straightway their front teeth and their grinders became broken, and their mouths were filled with pieces of broken teeth, and the insides of their mouths and their throats were cut deeply by them ; and they could not speak and were nigh unto death. And those who saw and heard this miracle marvelled greatly and were astonished, and by reason of their terror and awe of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, fear and trembling entered into their hearts. Then the thieves went and repented, and they forsook their evil deeds, and they entreated forgiveness of their sins from our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, and they gave unto Juliana and Barbara each a double portion of goods in return for their food which they had carried off. And our Lady, the store house of mercy, spared them, and restored their teeth to the condition in which they were aforetime; for she is able to do all things, and there is nothing which she cannot do, and she is a worker of miracles and wonders. May her prayer, and her blessing, and the mercy of her beloved Son, be with our King David for ever and ever! Amen. Thy power, O Mary, hath broken the tooth of our sin. When the thieves ate together morsels of the bread of the two maidens Thy power made manifest a wonderful thing, And thou, O my Lady, didst perform a work un known [before]. In thy sanctuary I desire to dwell. Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933. One Hundred and Ten Miracles of Our Lady Mary, pp. 39-40. London: Oxford University Press, H. Milford.

Fol. 47b, 1.] NOW there was a certain Abbess of the Monastery of Mount Carmel whose name was Sophia; she was a God-fearing woman, and she was very beautiful in form, and she loved our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, with her whole heart. And she had under her charge in that monastery a large number of virgins and women who were vowed to the ascetic life, and she taught them the rules and ordinances of the life of nuns, and strictly admonished them continually not to speak words of lightness and not to be slothful in observing the seasons of prayer. And for these reasons they hated her, and they awaited eagerly the happening of some scandal in her time so that they might remove her from her position. And there was in the monastery a certain young man, who was a servant and who attended to the food and clothing of the virgins, and Satan being jealous of the Abbess cast into her heart the lust of the flesh, and she committed fornication with that serving man and became with child by him. And this thing became manifest to the nuns, and they knew that the Abbess had conceived; and they went and made an accusation against her to the Bishop, whose name was Abba Severus, and informed him that the Abbess had become with child. Now when the Bishop heard this he sent a messenger unto the Abbess saying that the virgins were to be gathered together on a certain day, and that he would come to inspect them. And when the Abbess heard the words of the messenger she was terrified, and she knew that the virgins had laid an accusation against her. Then she went quickly into the church and prostrated herself before the picture of our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, the God-bearer. And she wept with a bitter weeping and a burning heart, and she said, ""O thou who lovest mercy and compassion, make soft thy heart towards thy sinful handmaiden who hath been entrapped in a snare, and show lovingkindness unto her, and do away the wickedness which I bear in my womb, and put me not to open shame, O my Lady."" Now through the abundance of her weeping she became ex hausted and fell asleep, and she saw in her sleep our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, come to her, having two angels with her. And she said unto the Abbess, ""Be not thou sorrowful, for behold, I have made supplication to my Son to forgive thee thy sin, but thou must never commit the sin again."" Then our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, said unto the two angels, ""Take ye away the child that is in her womb, and give it unto the man whose name is Pilkes (Felix), so that he may take it under his protection and suckle it, for he possesseth much cattle."" And the angels did as our Lady com manded them. Then the Abbess awoke from her sleep, and felt her womb and found that the child was not there. And she gave thanks unto our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-bearer, with her whole heart because of the miracle which she had wrought for her, and she went forth to her work according to her wont. And it came to pass that at the appointed season the Bishop arrived, and he entered into the abode of the virgins, and the Abbess met him, having with her one of the nuns who had made the accusation against her. Then the Bishop asked the Abbess how it was that she had become with child by fornication, and she denied it, saying, ""I have not done this thing."" And the Bishop commanded the oldest of the women to examine the Abbess, and to find out whether she was with child or not; and when they had examined her they found no trace of conception in her womb, and they thought that she was a virgin who had never known man. Then they told the Bishop this thing, but he did not believe them, and thought that, having taken a bribe from the Abbess, they were concealing her transgression for her. And the Bishop rose up, and with him there were priests, and deacons, and women who were devoted to the ascetic life, and they examined the body of the Abbess, but they did not find a child therein. Then straightway the Bishop repented with a great repentance, because he had reproached the Abbess without just cause, and he turned to those virgins who had made the accusation against the Abbess, and was wroth with them because they had accused her of shameful conduct. Now when the Abbess saw that the Bishop was angry she was afraid lest those virgins would be expelled and sent away and led into captivity by Satan through her. And straightway she rose up and said unto all the company, ""Depart ye from the Bishop for a season""; and she told him all her transgressions, and openly confessed to him what she had done in secret. And besides this she told him how our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-bearer, had appeared unto her, and how the two angels had taken the child from her womb, and how they had given him to a certain man to be suckled and reared. Now when the Bishop heard these things from the Abbess he marvelled exceedingly, and he sent a message unto the man, whose name was Felix, and who had perceived the miracle, to come and bring the child with him; and Felix came and brought the child with him. And it came to pass that when he arrived the Bishop questioned him closely about the child, and Felix told him, saying, ""Two young men of most goodly appearance came unto me and said, Our Lady Mary saith unto thee: Take this child and keep him with thee, and suckle him and rear him; then they gave me the child, and disappeared from me, and behold, this is the child."" And when the Bishop heard him he marvelled greatly, and he took the child and kept him in his own house, and he provided him with everything that was required by a child of his age. And when the boy had grown up he taught him the Psalms of David, and read to him stories of the Saints; and the Holy Spirit came upon him in abundance, and the love of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, was with him in full measure. Now after the death of Abba Severus the Bishop, they appointed the young man Bishop in his stead, and seated him upon [his] throne; and he was a good shepherd all the days of his life, and he died in peace. Mary is the Sanctuary of the Law, and she is the Evangelist, and the abode Of the Paraclete Who visited her. Thou didst remove quickly from the womb of Sophia the child of her sin; By the sound of thy supplication let my sin be done away Even as the foam of the sea is swallowed up by the sand. Budge, E. A.

Fol. 13b, 1.] NOW there was a certain Hebrew in the city of Akhmim who loved our holy Lady, the Godbearer, from the depth of his heart, and the mention of her name, with fear and trembling, was never absent from his tongue; and when he bowed down before her he was wont to embrace the ground in honour of her name. And the man was a priest, and he ministered holily in the church at the time of [burning] incense and presenting the offering (i.e. Eucharist). And it came to pass that when the days of his youth had passed, his strength failed and he was unable to stand up. And when the Archbishop knew that he had become feeble and was not able to stand up, he appointed two deacons to minister with him and to give him assistance. Now one day whilst he was singing praises to the name of our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, the God-bearer, and was bowing down to her to the ground, he fell for ward upon his breast, and his backbone was broken. And he cried out with a loud voice, and said, ""O my Lady Mary, come thou and help me in my fall."" Then straightway our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, appeared unto him standing on the right side of the altar, and she stretched out her hand over him, and touched his backbone which was broken, and made it whole. And she made a sign to him to come and stand on the right-hand side of the altar where she was. And immediately he perceived this he rejoiced greatly, and he marvelled and was astonished at the beauty of her form, and at the splendour which was round about her; and his old age was renewed, and he became a vigorous young man [again]. And he continued to minister in the church unto our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, all his days; and she added unto the years of his life one hundred and thirty years; and all his days were two hundred and thirty years, and then he died in peace and departed unto everlasting life. The blessed Hebrew in the land of Akhmim who had grown old, Whilst praising thy name and bowing to thee fell down. As thou didst appear unto him of old, and didst speak unto him the thing that was right, Even so, O Mary, appear thou unto me when I have taken to my bed; For upon this thing is my mind set with great anxiety.

Fol. 15a, 1.] NOW there was a certain monk called Damianus who dwelt in the city of Philippi, and he loved our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, from the depth of his heart, and he served her with all his power and strength, and he kept vigil in her church by day and by night. And that monk was a scribe, and it came to pass that, as he was copying the manuscripts [of her History], every time he had to make mention [of the name] of the Lady Mary he magnified her and paid honour unto her. Now he did not write her name with common water of lampblack (i.e. black ink), but he wrote it with ink made of gold and silver, and with rose-coloured paint, and with divers splendid colours that were like unto them in beauty and in value. And when that scribe fell ill, and was nigh unto death, before his soul departed from his body our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, appeared unto him, and said unto him: ""O my faithful servant, art not thou he who instead of writing my name in common black ink hath done so with ink of gold and silver, and hath painted it with divers splendid colours that are like unto them in beauty and value, and hath decorated it and made it glorious with the best of thine ability? Come now with me, that thou mayest see thy name inscribed with ornamental letters upon a pillar of gold in the kingdom of heaven. Fear not death to this transitory world, for behold, I will give thee everlasting life, and the joy that never cometh to an end."" And it came to pass that when she had spoken these words unto him his soul went forth from his body without pain and without suffering; and this miracle became known in all the country. May her prayer and the mercy of her beloved Son be with our King David for ever and ever! Amen. For Damianus who served thee as on a high mountain with deep devotion Thou didst write his name upon the pillar of red gold. O shining East, O Mary, O thou Morning, Write thou my name upon thy holy garments And upon the apparel of thy Son which is sprinkled with blood. Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933.

163,"The Muslim whom Saint Mary told to receive baptism. Later, as Bishop of Rome, he cut off his hand because of a carnal thought.",,,LIT3591Miracle,"[2 versions, very diff incipit] V THE VIRGIN MARY AND ABBAS, BISHOP OF ROME [A. Fol. 11a, 1; B. Fol. 16b, 1] NOW there was a certain Bishop of Rome who was called Abbas. He was a good and holy man, and he feared God Almighty and kept himself from unchastity and from meditation upon evil. And it came to pass that, one day during the festival [of the Virgin], when he was saying the prayer of consecration so that he might administer the Holy Mysteries to the people —now the people, both men and women, were in the habit at the time when they were about to receive the Holy Mysteries, before they prostrated themselves, of embracing the hands and the feet of the priest who was going to minister unto them—he smelt the odour of a certain woman as she was embracing his hands, and the unclean desire of the flesh entered into his heart, and he burned with the flame of lust. And after he had ended the Offering, he departed and went quickly into the chamber where the treasures belonging to the church were kept, and he took a knife and cut off his hand, and he began to weep. And it came to pass that while he tarried there the people in the sanctuary became very sad, and the priests and deacons went to him and said unto him: ""O master and governor of the people, we have waited long [for thee], and we are greatly distressed at thy tarrying""; and when they spake these words to him he wept the more. Then he rose up and went with them, and when he came before the picture of the holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, he fell down on his face before it, and he worshipped her and made supplication unto her, and entreated her to have mercy upon him, and to help him, and to pardon his sin. Then straightway our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, appeared unto him, and she took his hand [which he had cut off] in her holy hands, and rejoined it to the place from which it had been cut off, and it became whole even as it was aforetime, and no mark whatsoever of the cut could be found; then she disappeared from him. And when the priests and deacons saw this they marvelled and were silent. And they related this miracle to the people, and ascribed praise unto the glorious and Most High God, and gave thanks unto our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, who is able to perform all things, and who worketh miracles and doeth wonders. Now Abbas, a priest of Rome, Took a knife and cut off his hand, which caused him pain. As thou, O Mary, the sister of Salome, didst heal him of old, Even so do thou now heal the wound in my soul, and grant me rest Whensoever I invoke thy name, which giveth protection. Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933. One Hundred and Ten Miracles of Our Lady Mary, pp. 14-16. London: Oxford University Press, H. Milford. Va THE VIRGIN MARY AND LEO, BISHOP OF ROME [Brit. Mus. MS. Orient. No. 652, Fol. 82g.] THERE was a certain young man in the city of Rome who was a Muslim, and he was a survivor from the days of Islam [in that city]. And he used to go into a church, and stand before a picture of our Lady Mary, and salute her with salutations. And one day she spake unto him from out of her picture, and she said unto him, ""Why dost thou act thus, and come every day and pay me homage, not being one of the men of the Christian Faith?"" And he said unto her, ""I know that thou art the mother of God, and that thou canst deliver me from Sheol."" And she said unto him, ""Go thou to Father Leo, and he will help thee, and thou shalt be glad""; and he went to Father Leo. And Father Leo went out and he found the young man, and he said unto him, ""What dost thou want?"" And the young man said unto him, ""I wish thee to bring me back to the Christian Faith."" And Abba Leo baptized him, and called him by his own name, and he took him with him, and treated him as one of his children. And he handed him over to a teacher, and made him a deacon, and afterwards he made him a priest. When Abba Leo died, the people elected him to be their Abba in the room of Leo, for he was good and holy. And after he had been appointed Abba, one day he put on the Eucharistic vestments, and celebrated the Eucharist, and the congregation came and embraced his hands and his feet. And a few days later, a friend, a young woman, wished to go to him so that he might do her good, and she came to him with the [other] people, and she embraced his hand, and kissed it, and he was exceedingly angry. And having finished the celebration of the Eucharist, he went up on his couch and said, ""This hand of mine is defiled."" And he took a knife and cut it off, and he wrapped it in a cloth and set it down under his bed and went to sleep. And when the morning came, the people came to him and said, ""Come forth and officiate, for it is customary for a new Abba after his appointment to officiate for eight days without cessation""; and he said unto them, ""I cannot officiate to-day."" And they went away from him in anger saying each to the other, ""He is a pagan (Aramawi) and doth not wish to be Abba or to officiate."" And they went to him again on the third day, and said unto him, ""Officiate."" And he said unto them, ""I cannot."" And they said unto him, ""If thou wilt not officiate to-morrow they will set thee aside, and appoint another Abba in thy stead."" And he said unto them, ""Let them do as they please; I am well pleased that they should do this."" And at eventide he went down to the church, and stood up in front of the picture which had spoken unto him, and he said unto it, ""O my compassionate Lady, who didst show thy mercy and compassion unto me being unworthy of this gift, thou knowest how I have cut off my hand."" And the picture said unto him, Thou art a man without understanding and hast cut off thy hand. Knowest thou not that repentance cleanseth from sin? From to-day thou must never do such a thing again. Take this new hand which God hath given thee. And she fastened upon him a hand which was bright like the sun, and which sent forth light into all the place, and he rejoiced and was glad. And he gave thanks unto our Lady Mary who had shown favour unto him from first to last, and he went up into his bed and slept until daybreak. And at daybreak he went down to the church, and arrayed himself in the Eucharistic vestments, and when he raised his hand, there shot forth from it a light like that of the sun. And all those who looked at it were frightened, and all those who were in the church marvelled at this thing. And when he had finished the Office he went up upon his couch. And the bishops said unto him, ""Tell us what is this thing which we saw from thy hand to-day."" And he said unto them, ""Verily I tell you that my Lady Mary, the merciful one, gave me this hand. It is not a hand made of the earth""; and then he took up the hand which he had cut off [from under his bed] and showed it to them. And they marvelled at this thing and glorified God and gave thanks to our Lady Mary, who showeth acts of grace to those who serve her, and helpeth them in the time of their tribulation. Budge, E. A.

Fol. 12b, 1.] NOW there was a certain artificer who loved our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-bearer, with all his heart, and he was wont to address Salutations unto her day by day regularly, both morning and evening, and he continued to do this for many days. And it came to pass one day that he said unto her, ""O my gracious Lady, I address Salutations unto thee continually, but thou dost never return my salutation unto me."" And after he had said these words unto her he began to read the [Forty-two] Salutations to our Lady Mary, standing before her picture (or, image). And when he came to the passage wherein he said, ""Blessed art thou among women,"" our Lady Mary, the God-bearer, answered him from out of her picture, and said unto him, ""And blessed art thou among men."" And these words she spake unto him thrice. And when the artificer heard these words from the picture of our Lady Mary, he bowed down before her, and repented himself that he had dared to speak unto her; but he rejoiced because of the words which she had spoken unto him. And he loved her much more than before, and he devoted himself with additional zeal to her service until he passed away from this fleeting world.

And the fame of her was heard throughout all the ends of the world, and they brought unto her all those who were sick and diseased [fol. 77 5 ], and they touched  her body and were healed. Then they all said, “If the Child can heal “[the sick] whilst He is in the womb, what will He [not be able to do] when He hath been born?” And when the children of Israel heard [this], they gathered themselves together, and said, “What shall we say “concerning this matter? For behold, Joachim and Hanna have rent the “kingdom, and Hanna hath conceived, and by her womb shall she be healed, and she shall reign over us”. … Budge, E. A.

And she dwelt [in her  house] and added unto her prayers and supplications, and she gave her  possessions unto the poor and needy with joy and gladness, saying, “How can I reward God for all which He hath done unto me?” And she refrained from eating every kind of unclean food, and she made supplications to God and bowings [before Him] in great abundance, and prayed that He would preserve that which He had given unto her. And it came  to pass when the days of her conception were ended, on the first day of Genbot she brought forth a daughter, who was brighter than the sun, the beauty of whose [fol. 71 a] face was sweeter than honey and sugai, and the smell of whose odour was more lovely than that of any flower. Now when her kinsfolk and neighbours heard [thereof] they rejoiced  with a great joy, and they gathered themselves together and came unto her, and when they saw her daughter they marvelled exceedingly, and held their peace. Then they held converse among themselves, and said,  “We have never seen a child like unto this, for the grace of God in its  “fullest measure is upon her, and the light of God filleth all her members, and they continued seven days with Joachim and Hanna his wife, and they rejoiced and proclaimed the mighty deeds of God, that is to say  the grace of God. [fol. 71 b] And they called the child “Mary”, and when the seven days were ended, they came into their houses in peace. Budge, E. A.
