4,"Deacon Michael, the grocer and his stolen ring, which Mary helped find in a fish.",Europe confirmed (but earlier versions),"<p>In a village, there was a man named Michael. He was a deacon and loved Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, Mother of God. He was a grocer. He lived [worked?] in one of the stores of the market. Next to him, there was a Muslim full of excess zeal in his faith.  </p>
<p>The deacon placed in his mouth the greeting of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, Mother of God, by which the angel Gabriel greeted her saying, “Rejoice, O Full of Grace! God is with you. Blessed are you among women, and blessed the fruit of your womb.” When he sold and received the selling price, he said, “God’s power is great.” [Muslim phrase?]  </p>
<p>When the Muslim heard the deacon saying “God’s power is great”, fury and excess zeal seized him. The Muslim said, “Is there no God but for Christians alone, and is God’s power only with them?” Satan placed an evil thought in his heart: make the deacon stop mentioning God the Most High and greeting Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, Mother of God.  </p>
<p>He waited until the vigil of the Feast of the Dormition of Our Lady, the twentieth of the month of Terr [January 26 or so]. That day was a Saturday. At the ninth hour of the day, the deacon wanted to close his store. The Muslim suddenly appeared beside him. Then he said to him, “I want to buy from you three pounds of candy sugar.”  </p>
<p>The deacon said to him, “Pay me the price.”  </p>
<p>The Muslim said to him, “Prepare the sugar for me and I will pay you the price.”  </p>
<p>Since the deacon was afraid of the Muslim, he did not finish closing his store, but said, “God’s power is great, it is with me.”  </p>
<p>He opened one side of the entry canopy of the store and the Muslim entered, while the deacon pronounced the angel’s greeting. He said, “God’s power is great.” He got out the sugar, weighed three pounds for the Muslim, and said to him, “Pay me the price.”  </p>
<p>The Muslim lifted from his finger a very beautiful ring of much value and said to the deacon, “Take this ring for three days, you will give it back to me.” He spoke to him with cunning.  </p>
<p>The deacon took the ring, entered his store, opened a little box, placed the ring inside, and said, “God’s power is great.” He said also, “Greetings, O Virgin Mother of Light, for God is with you.” When the infidel heard these words, his anger increased. When the deacon turned to grab a lock (?)  to close the store, the infidel [secretly] opened the box and took the ring. The deacon did not know this. Then the deacon closed the door of his shop, saying, “God’s power is great.”  </p>
<p>The Muslim mocked him in his heart and said, “Tomorrow or the day after, you will see God’s power as it is exercised upon you [qui s’exercera avec toi].” Then the deacon went to his house. The infidel went immediately to the river and threw in the ring. He thought in his heart that he would not find it again. He did not know that God’s power is strong and overcomes all powers.  </p>
<p>Having gone into his house, the deacon dropped off the key to the store and went to the church, as was his custom, for prayer. He spent all of Sunday night keeping watch and pronouncing the angel’s greeting until morning came. After the end of the morning prayer, the deacon prepared the eucharist and was the servant [fut servant], for it was his turn that day. Having received the holy mystery, each returned to his house.  </p>
<p>The deacon entered his dwelling and joined his children and his wife to heat, drink, and rejoice. When they had served the meal, a small child, who was the youngest of the deacon’s children, wailed and said, “I will eat nothing but fish!” And he cried unabated. When the mother heard him, her heart was distressed and she ate nothing, and so did all the brothers and sisters of the child.  </p>
<p>After this, the deacon took money out of a coffer, gave it to his servant, and said to him, “Go, buy us some fish so that my children eat and do not hold grievance against me.” And he said, as was his custom, “God’s power is great.”  </p>
<p>When the servant left the house of his master the deacon, he only walked a little bit. He met a man carrying a fat fish; he bought this and brought it to his master’s house. When they opened the fish’s stomach to wash it, as was custom, they found the ring that the Muslim had thrown in the river.  </p>
<p>When the deacon saw the golden ring, he felt great astonishment and was dumbfounded. He told his wife all that had passed.  </p>
<p>Then they ate, drank, and thanked God for having given them this great grace.  </p>
<p>All this took place one Sunday, the twenty-first of the month of Terr, the day of the Dormition of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, Mother of God. [sounds like from Sinkissar] </p>
<p>Part II</p>
<p>The following day, the deacon took the ring. He did not know if this was the ring that he had placed in his store.  </p>
<p>So then he saw the Muslim sitting there, carefree (?). The Muslim said to the deacon, “Take your money and give me my ring.”  </p>
<p>The deacon said to him, “Sir, did you not see that I had placed it in a box? Be patient until I have opened the store.” Then the deacon opened his store and took the box in which he had placed the ring. When he opened it, he did not find the ring. So the deacon placed in the box the ring that he had found in the fish’s stomach.  </p>
<p>He brought the box next to the Muslim and said to him, “Pay me the price of my sugar and take your ring.”  </p>
<p>The Muslim said to him, “Show me the ring and take your money.”  </p>
<p>The deacon extended his hand toward the box in front of the Muslim, took out the ring, and presented it to him.  </p>
<p>When the Muslim beheld it, he was frightened and overcome by fear; his courage failed him. And then the deacon said, “God’s power is great.”   </p>
<p>The Muslim said to the deacon, “I beg you, by God, to let me know where you found this ring.” </p>
<p>The deacon said to him, “Behold [voici], I swore by the great power of God, which you heard me mention [de ma bouche]  at all times, to not tell you where I found this ring until you spoke to me with accuracy. “Indeed, there was no one with us when you gave me the ring, other than you and me.”  </p>
<p>After this, the Muslim told the deacon everything he had done. The deacon then let him know all that had passed. He said now, “All that has happened to me, to miserable me, of your doing, all occurred thanks to my Lady the Virgin Mary, because I greet her, because of my hope in God, and because of my trust in His great power.”  </p>
<p>Having heard the deacon’s speech, the Muslim fell to his feet and said, “In truth, the faith of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the faith of Christains, is truly a faith. “In truth, Mary is the Mother of God.”  </p>
<p>From this day, he took to loving Christians and, each Sunday, he went to the deacon’s house and heard from him the word of the books of the New and the Old Testament which are holy. He became a Christian. A few days later, this Muslim fled and despised the stay in this transitory world and went into the monastery of the monks who were over there. He remained to serve the monastery of the monks. He died in peace and inherited the kingdom of heaven through the intercession of Our Lady Mary.[Translation as of 05/21/22]</p>

5,The innocent Frenchman who was framed for theft by a spurned innkeeper’s daughter,Europe probably (France),"<p>A man living in Europe in the region of France, loved our Lady, the Virgin Mary, from his childhood on and he served her with all his strength. When it came time for him to marry, his parents arranged for him to marry a young woman from among the daughters of the Europeans. </p>
<p>Although he lived with his wife for fifteen years, he did not father any children. Because they lacked children, he and his wife grieved.</p>
<p>On [a Marian] feast day--that of the Building and Consecration of our Lady, the Virgin Mary’s [first] church [at Philippi], which happens every 21st of the month of Säne, [that is, on June 24]--that European man said to his wife, “My beloved sister,  look, an idea has come to mind  that I want to tell you about. For the holy Gospel says that, ‘a man and a woman are one flesh.’  Also, the apostle Paul says, ‘let not a man and a woman be separated from one another by the plan of one without consulting the other.’  </p>
<p>And his wife replied, “My lord,  what is the idea that God has placed in your mind?” </p>
<p>He responded to her saying, “My sister, you know that, from the day that I slept with you and you became my wife, as God is my sinful soul’s witness, I have not known any woman except for you. Now, today marks the fifteenth year in which we have not given birth to a child--leaving no one to perform our remembrance after our deaths, nor anyone who will inherit our possessions--and because of this we are grieving. Now, look, the feast of our Lady, the Holy Virgin Mary, draws near. If my plan seems good to you, let’s quickly go to her church,  sleep in front of her icon,  and trustingly ask her to ask her beloved son to give us a child, one who will make us happy and will inherit our wealth. I believe that her intercession is strong with her beloved son and he will not reject her petition.” </p>
<p>His good wife said to him, “As God is my witness, my beloved brother, this thought came [to me as well] tonight. And I told myself that I would tell you in the morning. It seems God placed this good plan in our hearts together, when he saw our hearts grieving, to be a comfort [for us].”  </p>
<p>So the two of them agreed to this plan. They prepared what they wanted to bring to the church, including candles, incense, and food as gifts for the clergy, as well as anything needed by the poor and destitute. [WLB: they need a lot! A few things for the poor and destitute?] The couple got up [to leave] with a pure heart, in complete love and without any doubt [in Mary], and then traveled to the church, which was far from their home. </p>
<p>When they arrived at the church, the chief deacon welcomed them with love and great joy, giving them a room in which to spend the night. </p>
<p>On the eve of the feast, the couple offered all of their gifts to the church, giving it to the steward.   After spending the night and rising on the morning of the feast, they asked custodian  to leave them alone in the church so that they might sleep in front of the icon of our Lady, the Holy Virgin Mary. He accepted their request and gave them permission to sleep there.</p>
<p>And when everyone else went to their own places to rest, the two of them stayed, in front of the icon of our Lady, the Holy Virgin Mary.</p>
<p>There, they wept with burning hearts, saying, “Dear holy Mother of God, Mary, hope of all the poor, joy of all the sorrowful! We ask you to see our grief and our tears and to ask your beloved son to grant us good fruit, which will cause our hearts to rejoice. A girl or a boy, [either one]. [WLB: or, a girl and a boy? “They” in next sentence] And that child will perform our remembrance after we depart from this world and will inherit our wealth. Look, the covenant of God is upon us, from this day forward until the time of our deaths. We will perform your remembrance on the 21st of every month, as long as we have strength.”</p>
<p>When they had completed their prayer and their petition, they slept a little. While they slept, they saw in their dream a very luminous woman.</p>
<p>She said to them, “God has received your request through my petitioning on your behalf. So, God will give you a male child. But, if he gives you [a child], consecrate him as a consecration to serve at the church of the Saint  James, the son of Zebedee.  When your son arrives at adulthood, let him serve the church until the day of his death. This is what my son has ordered.”</p>
<p>When they woke up, the husband and his wife told one another their dream, feeling overjoyed. Afterward, they partook in the holy mystery [of communion], finished celebrating the feast, and returned to their home peacefully. </p>
<p>On the eighth day [after the feast], the wife conceived. And, when the days of her pregnancy were finished, she gave birth to a boy. </p>
<p>When she consulted with her husband about what they should name him, he replied, “He will be named after James, the son of Zebedee, the brother of John the Evangelist.” And they named him thus. </p>
<p>When the child grew up and was twelve years old, his mother recalled the vision [they had had] and said to her husband, “Look, your son has grown up and reached manhood. He is now twelve years old. Yet, regarding him, we have not completed the consecration that Our Lady, the Holy Virgin Mary, demanded of us in the vision. Let’s get up and take him to the church of Saint James, the son of Zebedee, so that God and his mother the Holy Virgin Mary won’t be angry with us.”</p>
<p>He replied, “Alright.”</p>
<p>So, they traveled to the church of Saint James, the son of Zebedee, taking many gifts and [their son] James with them. By the way, that church was about a three-days journey distance from them. </p>
<p>While they were traveling on the road, night fell upon them. But, they found an inn  right there, a resting place for pilgrims, and they [went to] spend the night in it. </p>
<p>When they entered, the innkeeper happily received them, but when the innkeeper’s daughter saw them and their son, Satan placed a love for that son in her heart  because he was extremely handsome. </p>
<p>So, the innkeeper’s daughter approached them, bringing each of them lots of drinks and food. Then, after they had eaten and drank, they fell asleep due to their arduous travel. </p>
<p>While the innkeeper and all the people of his house slept, the innkeeper’s daughter approached that pure, virgin young man and woke him up from his sleep.</p>
<p>She asked him for something, that which ought not to be said,  just as her father Satan had taught her. </p>
<p>But that young man said to her, “My dear sister, as God lives, I don’t know what you’re talking about.” He added, “If you don’t go back to sleep near your father and mother, I will call out. Then, the people [here] will hear and you will be shamed.” [WLB: he doesn’t know, but he knows it is shameful?]</p>
<p>When she heard this from him, she was upset and enraged but didn’t say a single thing to him. Rather, she withdrew to her father and mother while gnashing her teeth.</p>
<p>Then that young man slept. Meanwhile, he had a sack, with the clothes he would wear in it.  </p>
<p>When he went out [the next day], she saw him near the [local] church. For a second time, Satan advised her and sowed an evil idea in her heart. So, she [went to his room and] opened the youth’s sack, placing among his clothes a gold chalice adorned with pearls and precious jacinth, of tremendous value. That young man had no idea she had done this.</p>
<p>When the next day [WLB: it just has to mean this] came, the husband, wife, and son got up and went on their way. </p>
<p>When they had gone a little distance, about three units  [WLB second time we have this term?] away, the innkeeper’s daughter said to her father, “my dear father, the gold chalice with pearls on it isn’t in its place. Truthfully, yesterday I gave those pilgrims a drink of wine in that gold chalice.”</p>
<p>He replied, “My dear daughter, they were rich people, they wouldn’t steal anything.”</p>
<p>She said to him, “Regarding his father and mother, they wouldn’t do this. But as for their son, he was an obstinate and ignorant young man. He would do something even worse than this.” </p>
<p>When the innkeeper heard his daughter’s account, he got up and went to pursue the young man and his parents. </p>
<p>But the innkeeper’s daughter [first] said to him, “I will go with you, because if you find them on the road with that pearl-encrusted gold chalice and you are alone, you won’t be able to arrest him. But if you find it on him, I will remain there and you can go to the city administrator and get soldiers who will arrest him.” </p>
<p>When he heard her idea, he agreed, so he took her with him and they traveled together until they came upon the young man and his parents. </p>
<p>The innkeeper then said to them, “The golden chalice that was with us [last] night and from which you drank wine has not been found. Look [to see] if you have it.” [singular?] </p>
<p>They replied, “As God lives, we have never stolen anything, in all our days! For God has not deprived us of worldly wealth!” </p>
<p>But that daughter of Satan drew near to them, boldly and disingenuously, [how ignorantly? Or pretending ignorance?] opened the youth’s sack while they were watching and pulled out the golden chalice.</p>
<p>When they saw this, the parents were shaken and deeply shamed. </p>
<p>They said to their son, “Our dear son. How dare you do this thing!”</p>
<p>He replied, “God knows that I didn’t do this or anything like it!” </p>
<p>Although the innkeeper wanted to send them on their way [without arresting them, since they had recovered the chalice,] that daughter of Satan went to the city administrator, bringing soldiers to [arrest] the son. </p>
<p>When they arrived there, the administrator condemned their son to death by strangulation, according to the custom of their city regarding thieves. </p>
<p>His father and mother despaired over this sentence.</p>
<p>The administrator’s soldiers took their innocent son from them and hung him on a tree to strangle him. </p>
<p>As for his parents, they were so distraught that they couldn’t [bring themselves to] look at him. Rather, they turned away, [WLB: it can’t be set out, they are still there in next paragraph] weeping and declaring, “Dear Merciful Intercessor, Mother of Life, it would have been better for us if you had never granted our petition for a son rather than have our son strangled. Where is your word that you spoke to us that our son would be a servant in the church of Saint James?”  With their heads buried [WLB: hung down?] in sorrow, they turned away [and left].</p>
<p>[After a little while,] the wife said to her husband, “[Let’s] turn back and go to the hanging [execution grounds? Hanging tree?] place where they strangled [hung] our son. [or strangled our son to death] If we find his body [still] hanging there, we will give money to the city administrator and ask him to give us our son’s corpse so that we may bury him.” </p>
<p>They [prayed and] said, “Where is your power and wonders, dear holy Mother of God,  merciful intercessor, Mary? Where is your assistance, oh, Saint James?” </p>
<p>The wife told her husband, “Don’t lose hope in God. But let’s go to his church first. This child was not [meant] for us, but for God and his Mother the Holy Virgin, consecrated to Saint James. Whether God wants to keep him alive or kill him, he is God! And we must not cease visiting the Church of Saint James so that Satan will not ridicule us.” </p>
<p>When he heard what she said, the husband went to the Church of Saint James and threw himself on the ground before the icon of the Virgin and the portrait of Saint James. He and his wife stayed there weeping bitterly for five days. </p>
<p>After that, they [left and] arrived [at the execution grounds/hanging tree]. They found their son [still] hanging on that tree [even though it had been] five days [and he was dead]. </p>
<p>Immediately, they cried out, weeping and grieving bitterly while striking their faces and beating their chests. His father pulled out [the hair of] his beard and his mother did likewise with the hair on her head. They threw themselves on the ground, on their faces, while saying, [wailing, lamenting] “Woe upon us, [How miserable we are? We're in big trouble! Help! It’s too late] our dear son! Woe upon us, light of our eyes! Woe upon us, dear lamp of our hearts! Why didn’t this hanging happen to your father, who got you born through numerous petitions, requests, and supplications to God, by petitioning the Lady of all of us, the Holy Virgin Mary? It’s better for your father to die than to live than to see you hanging on a tree like a thief or a robber. And [die] not due to natural causes of death. It’s better for your father to be eaten by a lion, swallowed by a crocodile, or [stamped on by] the feet of an elephant, dislodging his intestines, than to see you hanging on a tree and being strangled like a robber or a thief.”  </p>
<p>His mother added, weeping and wailing,“Woe is me, woe is me, my dear son! Woe is me, the dear light of my eyes! Woe is me, the joy of my heart! Woe to the breasts that have nursed you, woe to the knees which have dandled  you! It would be better for your mother to die than to live. [It would be better] for them to cut off pieces of my flesh, slice by slice, and give my body to the dogs, than to see you hung and strangled on a tree like this.”</p>
<p>They voiced these laments and [many] others like it.</p>
<p>Suddenly, while the son was hanging on the tree, he cried out.</p>
<p>He said to them, “You of little faith, why are you wailing and mourning like this? Why are you doubting? Haven’t you heard what the prophet David said, ‘God is a wonder among his holy ones.’   Or that he said, ‘God will not deprive those who walk in innocence from his blessings.’   I am James, your son. I’m telling you that, at that time when they hung me upon the tree and strangled me, our Lady, the Holy Virgin Mary, appeared to me in the likeness of a luminous lady, clothed in the marvelous linen of light. And there was an old man with her, [the Apostle James,] who told me, ‘Dear James, my namesake, don’t be afraid!’ For five days, the Virgin brought food to me every day. And she spoke with me, and she said to me, ‘Today your father and mother will come to you.  And other people will see the miracle of God.’”</p>
<p>When his parents heard this account, they immediately went, rejoicing, to the city’s administrator. They told him, “Our son lives! Get up and come with us so that you can bring him down.”</p>
<p>When the administrator heard this report from them, he announced [to those there], “These people don’t know anything--their son has been hanging, strangled, for five days.”</p>
<p>But the parents insisted, in front of a large assembly, “He’s alive!”</p>
<p>In front of the administrator, for his lunch, was a boiled chicken. The administrator declared, “When this [dead] chicken gets up, then [I will believe] your son is also alive.”</p>
<p>Immediately, the chicken stretched out its wings, awoke, and stood up from the plate, declaring, “‘God is a wonder among his holy ones.’”</p>
<p>When the administrator and all the people there saw this, they marveled in amazement. So, they said to his father and mother, “Tell us the story of your son.”</p>
<p>The parents said, “Bring him down first! And then we’ll tell you everything that has happened.”</p>
<p>So the administrator arose with joy, along with all the people of the city, men and women, and they went to the hanging tree. They found James alive and brought him down with great joy.</p>
<p>When the innkeeper’s daughter heard the roar of the crowd, and their shouting, she approached the administrator, in front of all the people, and told them the whole [true] story before they asked her. Because of what she had done to James with her false account, they condemned her to strangle.</p>
<p>Then, they asked his father to tell the story of his son[‘s life] and he told them everything that had happened, from before his birth until that very day. </p>
<p>They marveled in astonishment, saying, “Truly, this young man is consecrated to God and to his mother, the Virgin.” They gave many thanks to Our Lady, the Holy Virgin Mary. </p>
<p>However, when they wanted to hang/strangle the innkeeper’s daughter, the people said they shouldn’t do this without the counsel of the bishop.</p>
<p>So, they went together to the Bishop, telling him everything that had happened. He praised God greatly. </p>
<p>Then, he questioned and interrogated the innkeeper’s daughter. She related every detail accurately to him, from the beginning to the end, about how Satan had guided her to love the handsome young man James. She told him, “My dear father, I will bear witness to God if, at this time, you pardon me from this [death] sentence by hanging. I will [vow to] never be married to any man. My dear father, benefit my soul and deliver me from death and eternal Sheol.”</p>
<p>When the young man and his parents heard her report, they prostrated themselves in front of the bishop and asked him to show the innkeeper’s daughter mercy for God’s sake. They said to the bishop, “Perhaps this has come to pass by the will of God in order to reveal a marvelous and mighty miracle by means of his mother’s intercession and his pure disciples’ petition.”</p>
<p>Immediately, [the bishop agreed and] he shaved her head, clothed her in nun’s clothes, gave her a severe penance, and sent her to the Church of Our Lady, the Holy Virgin Mary, where she remained serving until the day of her death.</p>
<p>Then, three days before the innkeeper’s daughter’s death, our Lady, the Holy Virgin Mary, appeared to her. She told Mary to petition her son [Christ] on her behalf, to accept her repentance, for three days, until she would depart from this world.</p>
<p>Our Lady, the Holy Virgin Mary, told the innkeeper’s daughter that she had petitioned her son on her behalf and he had accepted her repentance. [She also told her that] three days from now she would depart this world.</p>
<p>Then, the innkeeper’s daughter told the bishop [about Mary’s message], and he released her from her penance.</p>
<p>After three days, the innkeeper’s daughter died, just as our Lady, the Holy Virgin Mary, had told her.</p>
<p>May the blessings of her prayers be with our King Zara Yaqob forever and ever, amen.</p>
<p>[Meanwhile,]  the Bishop had taken the pure James and led him, along with his parents, to the Church of Saint James the Apostle, Son of Zebedee. And the Bishop appointed James as a deacon, and gave him over [for training] to a teacher in the church.</p>
<p>When James had done many righteous deeds, the bishop appointed him as a priest in that [very] church. And he remained serving that church until the day of his death.</p>
<p>Have you seen, my dear beloved brothers, how James placed his trust in God and loved our Lady, the Holy Virgin Mary, with his whole heart? And how James protected himself with purity, just as God [protected,] saved, and rescued him from falling into the hands of his enemy, a Sataness?</p>
<p>May God view us, and also you [the listener], as his obedient followers and the guardians of his commandments. May he make us pure in spirit and flesh by way of the intercession of the Lady of all of us, the Holy Virgin Mary, and by the prayer of Saint James, Son of Zebedee. </p>
<p>May her prayer and intercession be with our King Zara Yaqob forever and ever, amen.[Translation as of 05/21/22]</p>

6,Arabs try to plunder the monasteries of Egypt during the famine of 1120 MM [likely 1404 CE] and the time Patriarch Matthew,Africa Egypt confirmed,"<p>This [miracle] happened in the year of the Pure Martyrs, 1120 [that is, 1404???],  in the days of the Lord Father Patriarch Abba Matthew [I of Alexandria].  </p>
<p>A great famine happened in the land of Egypt. They say it happened because the water of the Nile did not rise that year as it usually did.</p>
<p>But the Patriarch knew in advance, through the spirit, that the water of the Nile would not rise that year. And so he sent a great amount of food to the monasteries, including a great deal to the monastery of Saint Anthony and the monastery of Saint Samuel of Qalamon.</p>
<p>When the famine worsened, the people and the Arabs heard that there was a great amount of food in the monastery of Abba Samuel. So they kept coming to the monastery and bothering them for food.</p>
<p>The monks knew that their food would run out [if they fed the people]. Then, it would not be enough to sustain the monks themselves and they would starve to death.</p>
<p>In the monastery of Abba Samuel was a tall tower,  which was on top of the citadel of the treasury.  It was fifty cubits tall and impossible to climb without a ladder.</p>
<p>So the monks brought the food that remained up to the top of that tower and having climbed up, they remained there out of fear of the Arabs.</p>
<p>After a few days had passed, one of the monks climbed down [to the citadel, on the way] to make a little bit of broth for them and to light the candles in the church, those candles in front of the icon of our Lady, the Holy Virgin Mary. That icon was known to perform many miracles.</p>
<p>But the wicked Arabs arrived and pounded on the gates of the monastery. </p>
<p>That monk, who was named Jacob, leaned his head out from the roof of the citadel, and recognized that they were Arab men. So, he didn’t open the gates for them, being afraid of them.</p>
<p>Instead, he went [down] to the mill intending to get a little bit of grinded grain and climb back up the citadel to his brother monks.</p>
<p>However, two of the Arabs climbed up the monastery’s fortified wall and then down it [inside], finding Jacob before he had climbed back up to the citadel.</p>
<p>Then, they seized him and beat him until he was on the edge of death. After, they took him with them to their companions[, leaving through the gates].</p>
<p>When his brother monks saw what had happened, they were distraught and grieved. So, when night came, the monks came down from the citadel and prostrated themselves before the icon of Our Lady, the Holy Virgin Mary, and they asked her to rescue Jacob.</p>
<p>Then, they closed the monastery’s gate, climbed to the roof of the citadel, and did not eat or drink anything that night.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Arabs took the monk and brought him to their companions.</p>
<p>However, when it came time to sleep, they were afraid the monk would flee [and cost them food, because] they imagined that the monks would come out and give them what they wanted, so that the Arabs would return Jacob to the monks.</p>
<p>So, they took Jacob and tied him to räkʷəb,  that is to say, [horse’s] stirrups. He stretched out his feet [in the stirrups] and they placed three long spears between his feet and the stirrups[, thrust into the ground].  Then, they connected the stirrups with an iron chain, placing it in the hands of one of them.</p>
<p>Then those Arabs slept, leaning against the shafts of the spears so that that monk wouldn’t escape them. [WLB review stopped here Stopped at 37r, col 1, line 13.]</p>
<p>While those Arabs slept, the monk kept saying, “My dear Virgin Lady, I beg you, by the suffering of your beloved son, which he received on our behalf, do not dwell on my sins, but instead save me from those merciless men. Don’t forget my [tireless] service efforts in your church.”</p>
<p>He kept asking this with weeping and sorrow. He slept after a little while and saw a luminous woman in his dream. With her was a luminous man. She instructed that [luminous] man to cut the spears and remove the monk’s feet from the stirrups. </p>
<p>After this [instruction], the monk saw that in the luminous man’s hand was a saw, with which he was cutting off the iron chains.</p>
<p>Then the monk saw that luminous woman place her hand upon his flesh and heal him.She said to him, “Wake up and go to your monastery and tell your brother monks what you have seen.”  </p>
<p>And when he woke up from his sleep, he found the spears cut, his feet freed, and his whole body healed from the beating.  </p>
<p>Instantly, he [leapt up and] went running fearlessly on his [healed] feet, arriving at the monastery and finding the luminous man at the gates, which were open. </p>
<p>And the luminous man said to the monk, “Enter your monastery, and tell your brothers the wonders of God.” </p>
<p>And when he entered the monastery, he heard his brothers weeping bitterly on his behalf.  </p>
<p>And so he cried out to them, from below the citadel, “My dear brother monks, be confident in God and the strength of his hand and the miracles of his mother, the Holy Virgin Mary. It is I, your brother Jacob!”  </p>
<p>And when they heard his voice, they recognized it, so they descended and embraced him with great joy. Right away, they asked him about everything that had happened to him. And so he told them everything that he had seen, how the monastery’s gates opened of their own accord, and so he entered and then closed the doors, as they had been before. </p>
<p>Immediately, they brought him up to the citadel, fearing the Arabs. </p>
<p>And when dawn broke, the Arabs woke up and found the spears cut and the chain cut as well. But they did not find the monk. They talked amongst themselves, saying, “The monks must have come in the night and taken him from us.”  </p>
<p>But some among them said, “It’s impossible for those monks to leave the citadel because they are feeble. So, let’s get up and go to the monastery and ask for the story on that monk.” </p>
<p>And when they arrived at the monastery, they stood at a [little] distance, opposite the citadel, and asked the monks to tell them the story of Jacob. </p>
<p>So, the monks stood the monk up on the top of the citadel and they related everything that had taken place and how the monk was released from his bonds. And the monks swore to the Arabs, saying, “From the time that you took the monk until you returned, not one of us has left the monastery’s gates. Rather, we descended to the icon of the holy virgin Mary and we asked her to rescue our brother.”  </p>
<p>As for Jacob, he told them that he had asked our Lady to rescue him from them.  </p>
<p>And those Arabs said, “Dear monks, we understand that it is impossible for a dead man to do powerful things like this. Rather, it must be the power of God and the petition of the Virgin Mary. From now on, we will come to this monastery and we will serve you and do what you desire. Moreover, have mercy upon us wholeheartedly and beseech the Virgin Mary to not pay us in kind for what we have done, that is, the beating of this monk. Look, let these three camels belong to the monastery.” </p>
<p>The Arabs cleaned the camels up and placed them at the gates of the monastery. Then, after confessing their sins, the Arabs bid the monks farewell and went on their way. And after they left, the monks descended from the citadel, opened the gates, and brought in the camels.  </p>
<p>And those Arabs reported to their people everything that had happened. Then, they all swore to each other that not one of them would go to that monastery until the days of the famine had passed. </p>
<p>From that day on, until those days had passed, none of the Arabs or Muslims went to the monastery.  </p>
<p>And God showed mercy to his servants and food became abundant in all the provinces of Egypt.  </p>
<p>May the blessings of this, our Lady Mary, be with our King Zara Yacob until forever and ever, amen, and amen. [Translation as of 05/21/22]</p>

7,Dabra Qaləmon miracles: The monk of Dabra Qaləmon who humbly pretends not to fast and is saved from his brothers by Mary.,Africa Egypt confirmed (Däbrä Qaləmon),"<p>There was in the great and holy Monastery of Abba Samuel of Kalman a beautiful church which had been built in the name of our pure and holy Lady Mary, and in this holy church, in the west wall thereof, was a large and wonderful picture of her. </p>
<p>And in this famous monastery there lived a certain holy man who had fixed in his heart and mind the salutation of the Angel Gabriel unto our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, and it never ceased to be in his mouth and on his tongue. And he rested neither by night nor by day from reciting salutations to our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, and he placed his confidence in her, [and believed] that she would save him in the presence of her beloved Son.</p>
<p>He [pretended] neither to fast nor to pray, and he made himself to appear to be foolish and weak of understanding, so that the [other] monks might not know concerning his strivings and labours; and he used to act in such a way that the monks treated him with contempt—now this was an unseemly thing for the monks to do—when they went out from the church. </p>
<p>In the morning, at the time when the sun was rising, he ate a few herbs and beans, and to every one who spoke with this monk he appeared to be mad. And he ate nothing from that time until the same hour of the morrow of that day, when he again ate in the presence of the monks; and this he was wont to do daily.</p>
<p>Now when the monks saw him acting in this wise the matter was hard for them, and they were exceedingly sorry for him. And this monk, whom we have already mentioned, did not receive the Holy Mysteries except on three days in each year, that is to say, on the festival of the blessed Nativity, on the festival of the holy Epiphany, and on the festival of the precious Passover (Easter).</p>
<p>And our honourable and holy Fathers, the doctors of the Church, have commanded that the Offering shall be offered up on these days of festivals of the Son at the sound of cockcrow in the night. And it came to pass that when the monks saw him eating each day in the morning before the prayer of the third hour of the day, and knew nothing about his fasting, and of how he was wont to fast until the morrow of the day when at the time of the same hour he ate [again], they imagined that he ate at the ordinary times throughout the day, and did not keep the ordinance of the monks; and they murmured greatly against him among themselves. </p>
<p>And when the day of the festival of the Nativity of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, which is on the first day of the month Genbot (April 26), had come—now the day of the nativity of the woman who saved the whole world [fell that year] upon the day of the blessed First Day of the week—the monks were gathered together in the church to be present at the honourable consecration of the Offering for the celebration of the festival. </p>
<p>And there was with them the holy father who was called Abba Isaac, and he was the Abbot of the monastery and the father confessor and prior, and he saw the monk whom we have already mentioned with a few lupin seeds, which had been soaked in water, in his hand, and he wished to eat them. Then the Abbot said unto the monks, ""Seize ye that monk and take from him those lupin seeds that he hath in his hand, and let two of the brethren bring him into the church and keep guard over him until the service of consecration be ended—sup posing it be possible for us to offer up the Holy Offering. 
Peradventure this evil habit shall be removed from him by the prayer of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, and he shall walk in the way of the monks with the keeping of fasts and prayer."" </p>
<p>Then the monks did according as the Abbot had commanded them, and they took the lupin seeds from his hand with rude violence; and straightway the monk was enraged with those who had laid hands upon him, and he became like a madman. And when they had brought him to the church he said unto the monks who were going to keep guard over him, ""O my brethren, will ye not hearken unto the voice of your father concerning me? I am a poor and wretched man, take me unto the picture of our Lady so that I may entreat her to accept the prayer of our Abbot, and that all my hunger may be removed from me little by little."" </p>
<p>And they told him that they agreed to do so, and they went with him to the eikon of the Virgin, and he prostrated himself in adoration before her, and said, ""O thou who dost save the penitent, O thou who art the hope of the poor and needy, O thou who art the helper of the oppressed, deliver thou me from these monks, for I can not fast until the time of the Offering."" And it came to pass that when the two brethren heard these words from him they laughed within themselves, and they heaped derision upon him. Now when our compassionate Lady knew that the whole body of monks were murmuring against him, and that they were laughing at him and treating him with contempt, she put into his heart the good thought that she would make manifest unto the other monks her mighty and marvellous acts and the faith of the monk and the confidence which he had placed in her. </p>
<p>And at the moment when the service of consecration was half finished, and when every man had brought his mind into a fit state and collected his thoughts to hear the holy words of the consecration, the monk drew nigh unto the west wall of the church, wherein was placed the picture of the Virgin Mary, and standing up before it and lifting up his eyes he said unto her, ""O my Lady, peradventure thou dost receive my prayer, and dost accept my supplication and the salutation of the Angel Gabriel wherewith I have saluted thee ceaselessly by day and by night. I am a poor and wretched man and a sinner, and only God and man have any knowledge of me. I have thought that thou wouldst deliver me on the Day of Judgement before thy Son, and if thou wilt deliver me before thy Son, then deliver me from these monks; for [all men] know that whosoever putteth his trust in thee shall neither perish nor be put to shame before thy beloved Son."" <p>
<p>Then he girded himself about with faith and power, and he took off his skull cap from his head, and smote the western wall of the church therewith, and said, ""O might of the Virgin Mary, deliver me."" And it came to pass that, when he had spoken in this wise, at that same moment the wall was rent asunder, and having hurled his skull-cap from his hand into the middle of the church he passed outside quickly through the opening in the wall. And when he had gone out the wall closed together again, with the exception of a small opening that was large enough for a man to put his hand into, and this remained as a memorial and a testimony of the miracle which the holy Virgin Mary had wrought; and when the monks saw what had taken place they were astonished with a great astonishment.</p>
<p>Then the monks went out to look for the monk in all the desert places round about, and in the caves and hollows in the ground, but they found no trace of him. And straightway they sorrowed with a great sorrow, and their hearts were pained, and their Abbot was exceedingly harsh [towards them] because of the things that they had been wont to do unto him.</p>
<p>For, when in times past they had been in the habit of seeing him every day at dawn, some of them cursed him, and some buffeted him, and some spat in his face, and others laughed at him and derided him.</p>
<p>Now when they had seen this miracle they recognized the righteousness and the strivings of the monk, and how he had loved our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, in his heart, and how he had put his confidence in her, even as they had heard from him when he departed through the opening in the wall. And they learned that of a certainty the heart felt prayer of a pure and sincere mind is better and more honourable than the prayer of the tongue, even as our Lord saith in the Holy Gospel, ""When thou risest up to pray, enter into thy chamber, and shut thy door, and pray unto thy Father in secret"" (Matt. vi. 6). Now the meaning of this [verse] is, ""Collect thy mind within thyself""; and in that it saith, ""Shut thy door,"" thou must shut thy mouth and pray with thy heart. For the prayer of the heart in a mind that is sincere and collected is better than the prayer of the tongue when the mind is wandering about and going into another place. It is meet for a man to pray with his heart, and not with his tongue [only], even as this monk was wont to do at all times, although no one knew about it. </p>
<p>And it came to pass that, when the monks saw what had happened, they went to the Bishop, and told him all these things. Now when the Father, the Bishop, had heard thereof, he sent and informed the Archbishop concerning what he had heard and seen in the matter of the skull-cap, which the monk had thrown into the church, and concerning the miracle that had taken place through it.</p>
<p>And when the Archbishop had heard these things he rejoiced greatly, and he sent to the holy Monastery of Abba Samuel asking for the skull-cap of the monk, so that he might obtain a blessing therefrom; but the monks would not send it to him, for they thought that he would lay it up in his own house as a thing to be kept there for safety. So they placed the skull-cap in the store-chest of the church as a memorial of the miracle that the Lady of us all, the Virgin Mary, had wrought.</p>
<p>Now in order that the Bishop might prepare the way for him, the Archbishop sent a message to l1im telling him to go to the Monastery of Kalman, and to bring back the skull-cap to him that he might be blessed thereby. And the Bishop obeyed the command of the Archbishop, and went to the monastery, and took the skull-cap of the monk from out of the chest wherein the property of the church was stored, and he obtained a blessing therefrom. Then he went to the wall that had been rent asunder, and he obtained a blessing from the opening that was left, and he prostrated himself three times before the picture of our Lady Mary, and he received a blessing therefrom. Then the Bishop anointed himself with oil from the lamp that was kept burning before the picture, and he departed from the monastery.</p>
<p>Now when he had journeyed a little way on his road, and had arrived in the desert, he searched for the skull cap and found it not; and having turned back straight way he came to the monastery a second time, and he found the skull-cap in the place wherein it had been laid formerly, and whence he had taken it.</p>
<p>Then he took the skull-cap a second time, and laid it between the folds of his apparel, and he tied it securely to his person with strips of leather. And when he had journeyed a little way he untied the strips of leather, and un fastened his apparel, but he could not find the skull cap in it; then he turned back a third time to the monastery, where he again found the skull-cap. And he took it out of the store-chest again and fastened it to the inside of the case wherein he carried his cross, and having taken it in his hand he set out again on his journey, but when, having gone a little way on his road, he unfastened the case of the cross, he did not find the skull-cap.</p>
<p>Now when he had gone back to the monastery a fourth time and found the skull-cap there, he knew that God did not wish it to leave the holy Monastery of Abba Samuel. And the report of this thing was heard in all the borders, and in all the countries and cities round about.</p>
<p>Glory be to God Who chose Mary, the Virgin, to be the Mother of His Son Jesus Christ, and thanks be unto His Only Son Who put on flesh of her in becoming the new man, and adoration be unto the Holy Spirit Who purified her from all unchastity.</p>
<p>O Mary, who without stroke of hammer, or blow of chisel, Didst cleave a wall of dry stone where there passed out into the desert The man who was called Shalura, with whom thou wast well pleased, Cleave thou the back of mine enemy and the belly of him that hateth me, And take thou a new sword [to do it].

8,Dabra Qaləmon miracles: The monks of Dabra Qalamon are robbed by Berbers and aided by Arabs,Africa Egypt confirmed (Däbrä Qaləmon),"<p>It came to pass one day that [five] monks left the monastery of Abba Samuel of Qalamon to fulfill the [material] needs of the monastery. Their group consisted of five men, the Abott Solomon, his brother David, the priest Zacharias, the priest Michael, and the deacon Jacob.  </p>
<p>But when they arrived in the middle of the desert, they came across five [other] men, mounted on five camels, who were from the wicked Berber  people who did not know God. It was their practice to steal goods from every person they encountered on the road and to leave them with nothing.  </p>
<p>So, when they came across those monks on the road, the Berbers stripped them of their clothes and caps, leaving them naked. They took everything the monks had and even wanted to kill them. But God placed mercy in their hearts so that they wouldn’t kill the monks. Instead, they sent the monks on their way.</p>
<p>After the Berbers had stripped them, taken all their possession, [and left,] the monks grieved and wept bitterly.</p>
<p>The priest Zacharias, who was an aged and senior man among the monks, began to speak. [He said,] “My dear Lady, if we have sinned or have failed to serve your monastery well or have ceased to serve you out of laziness, then give us penance in the monastery [not like this]. If not that, you bringing a terrible sickness, eye disease, or any other rebuke upon us for punishment, would be better [than this]. If the people were to hear that the monks of Our Lady Mary of Qalamon had Arabs [WLB: not Berbers?] fall upon them, who had taken everything the monks had with them, and the Virgin Mary failed to save them and didn’t perform a miracle against those who stole their clothes, then the people’s faith in you--and us and the monastery and the church that was built in your name and [your] icon that reveals miracles all the time--would wane. We would be despised all of the time by all of the people. Rather than being despised [like this],, starting now, we won’t dwell in [your] monastery until you reveal your miracle, and your power against those men.”  </p>
<p>Then, the priest Zacharias turned to his brother monks and he said, “Listen to me, I advise that we go back to our monastery, collect clothes to wear, go to the Monastery of Saint Anthony, and remain there until when the Virgin reveals her miracles.” </p>
<p>But, the monks replied, “We won’t return to that monastery and we won’t live there.” </p>
<p>Zacharias said, “Dear brothers, don’t lose hope in God, nor in his mother, the Virgin Mary, until you see what will happen after this. If we go to Rif, we will be terribly embarrassed and our enemies will laugh at us. Then the Muslims will grow in number and they will ridicule the mother of the Lord, the Virgin Mary. Instead, let us return to our monastery and stay there for three days. If God doesn’t reveal the power of his mother, the Virgin Mary, then we won’t dwell in that monastery ever again. For I know that our sins are great, but God’s compassion and mercy is greater than our sins.” </p>
<p>After many [such] exhortations, he convinced the monks and they returned to their monastery.  </p>
<p>However, they were weeping and grieving--not because they had been stripped [of their clothes] and everything they had taken, but rather because the miracles that had [previously] come constantly from the Virgin [were at an end] and she had now abandoned them.  </p>
<p>When they had started back to the monastery, after two or three measures,  the priest Michael turned to look back and, behold, he saw a great cloud of dust behind them, as well as men riding camels following them.  </p>
<p>Michael exclaimed to the monks,  “It’s the men who stripped us! Now they are following us to kill us!” </p>
<p>When the monks saw what was happening, they bid one another farewell and told the priest Zacharias, “May God judge  you with our blood! If we had gone to Rif, this wouldn’t have happened to us. And these men would not have fallen upon us.”  </p>
<p>They wept with burning hearts and begged our Lady Virgin Mary not to be repulsed by them.  </p>
<p>But, when those men drew near to the monks, the monks recognized them as those Arabs  [that is, Bedouins, who lived] near their monastery and the ones who usually brought the monks their food and necessities. Seeing this, the monks rejoiced.  </p>
<p>When the Arabs reached the monks, they said to them, “What has happened to you? Who has taken your possessions and stripped you of your clothes and made you a laughing stock,a figure of ridicule, and an embarrassment? Why did Mary abandon you?” </p>
<p>The monks replied, “At present, she has abandoned us because of our sins.” </p>
<p>They reported how some of those Berbers fell upon them on the road, took their possessions, stripped them of their clothes, and wanted to kill them, but they were saved [from death] by the marvelous act [of God placing mercy in their hearts].</p>
<p>At once, those Arabs said to the monks, “Rejoice in God and in Mary because God had repaid them, [those Berbers]. So, listen, we’ll tell you what has happened. While we were encamped,  we wanted to eat a little food and on our way to the monastery, we heard a voice calling us, saying, ‘Oh Arabs, come quickly! Go on the monastery road toward Rif, because your enemies are there.’”</p>
<p>“And we turned this way and that, but we didn’t see anyone [speaking].</p>
<p>“Our camels were [already] loaded and so we went [on our way] until we approached Rif. We came across [those] five Berbers who took your possessions. Those men are our enemies, who fight with us all the time. </p>
<p>“Having camped, those men were dividing your woolen robes amongst themselves as well as everything else they had taken. [When they saw us,] they came up to us, thinking we were one of them. But we cut off the heads of those five with a sword. </p>
<p>“Now, look, we have brought your belongings to you, because we knew that these were monks’ clothes. Truthfully, dear monks, Mary, who was present in your monastery, is the only one who spoke to us [about what had happened].”</p>
<p>When the monks heard the Arabs’ report, they lifted up their voices, saying, “Peace to you, Mother of Life, who was not repulsed by our sins.”</p>
<p>Then, the Arabs put the [stolen] robes, caps, and [billon] on the monks, [those clothes] that they had brought back. </p>
<p>The monks then went back to the monastery with the Arabs. </p>

9,"Dabra Qaləmon miracles: An Arab man who steals the scissors of Jacob the Short, a tailor, falls ill until he returns them",Africa Egypt confirmed (Däbrä Qaləmon),"<p>In the monastery of Qaləmon of Saint Abbâ Samuel, there was a man named Jacob the Short whom Our Mother, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary mother of God, had saved from the chains of the Arabs. </p>
<p>His job was sewing clothing; he sewed monks’ tunics/garments as well as coverings and curtains for the decoration of the church and altar. </p>
<p>One day, he sat down within the enclosure of the church to sew a covering of silk for the icon of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary mother of God, on the eighth of the month of Tâhsâs. </p>
<p>While he was sewing, an Arab man came and entered the monastery to eat some bread and feed his horse some grain. That was the custom: one entered the monastery as its guest. The man sat down next to Jacques, there where he was sewing, and waited for someone to bring him his meal. </p>
<p>The Arab man caught sight of the scissors Jacques had placed down next to himself. At that moment, Satan placed in the man’s heart the desire to steal. Abruptly the Arab was overwhelmed by [these thoughts] and stole the scissors. Meanwhile Jacques was unaware of anything happening. Immediately, the Arab man stood up and quickly left the monastery without drinking or eating anything. Then, when his food and drink was brought for him, he could not be found. </p>
<p>After a long time [working], Jacques turned around looking for the scissors. He did not find them and understood that the Arab had stolen his scissors and left. Immediately, Jacques stood up, entered the church, and stood before the icon of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary mother of God.</p>
<p>He said, “[As sure as] the God Jesus Christ born of you is alive, if a miracle is not worked [to retrieve] these scissors and you do not return them to me, I shall never again sew anything for you or for the monks, and I will live no longer in this monastery.” [WLB: or: I won’t be able to sew for you or the monks anymore and I won’t be able to stay in the monastery]</p>
<p>When the Arab man had taken the scissors, he had hidden them in his tunic, in the deepest interior. When he was a bit farther from the monastery, he plunged his hand into his tunic to take out the scissors[, planning] to examine them carefully because they were decorated with gold and silver. </p>
<p>However, when he took out the scissors, he found out that they had transformed into a huge serpent. Terrified, he threw the serpent on the ground, far from his hand.</p>
<p>As soon as he did that, the serpent turned back into scissors, as before. The Arab man stared at the silver and gold on them, shining in the blazing sun. </p>
<p>He dismounted from his horse and picked up the scissors in his hand. Again, when he picked up the scissors, they became a huge serpent. He threw it far from his hand a second time.</p>
<p>Then, he did all that [over again] a third time.</p>
<p>When he saw this [ongoing] miracle, he felt terrified. So, he buried the scissors in the sand, placed a large stone on them, and marked their place. Then he headed [away from the monastery and] towards the cultivated fields. </p>
<p>When he arrived there, a nuisance called saqit, meaning “illness of half of the body,”  took hold of him. He cried out day and night.</p>
<p>           He lived with this illness for seven months, in great torment, sleeping on the side of one of his limbs (?).</p>
<p>Asleep one night, he saw a woman of gracious beauty and absolute radiance. She said to him, “Man, this illness has fallen upon you because of the scissors you took from the monastery.”</p>
<p>When he woke from his slumber, he said to his friends, “Pick me up and carry me to the monastery of Qaləmon and before Our Mother, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, mother of God. There I will be cured of my illness.”</p>
<p>His parents said to him, “Yes, we will take you.”</p>
<p>Then they picked him up and carried him.  When he arrived there where he had buried the scissors, he said to those who were with him, “Dig here.”</p>
<p>Once they had dug, they found the buried scissors. He took them and brought them to the monastery. </p>
<p>When he was close to the monastery, the scissors [again] tempted him, being so beautiful before his eyes. So, he turned slightly away from the road to look at what he had taken out in front of those who were with him, and it was a huge serpent. </p>
<p>Having seen this, they were ensnared and stupefied, and so fled, overcome by fear; he informed them of what had happened [three times previously]. </p>
<p>After that, he watched the serpent turn back into scissors. He picked them up in his hand and arrived at the monastery. </p>
<p>The Arabs with the thief said to abbot of the monastery, Salomon,  “Assemble all the monks for us. We must inform them of a matter.”</p>
<p>The abbot said to them, “What is your matter?” </p>
<p>So, they told the abbot everything that had happened from the beginning until the end. When the abbot heard of the matter, he praised God, exalted his name, and sounded the bell for gathering. All the monks assembled, and the Arab man recounted all that had happened to him. Likewise, his Arab friends were witnesses about what they had seen regarding that matter.</p>
<p>Then the Arab man said to the monks, “I beg you by the living God to have pity on me, and to implore Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, mother of God, to heal me. From now on I will be a servant of this monastery until the day of my death and I will not cause harm to anyone.”</p>
<p>So, Salomon took a little oil from the lamp that blazed before the icon of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, mother of God, and marked the Arab man with it and anointed him in full.</p>
<p>The next morning, the Arab man had been restored and cured of his illness. [From that day] until he died, he transported whatever the monks needed on his camels.</p>
<p>My brothers, may there be no lack of faith in you! Is it impossible for he who turned the staff of Moses into a serpent and who spoke with the Balaam donkeys in human language to perform this miracle and wonder for the glory of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, mother of God?</p>
<p>May her prayer and blessing be with us both now and forever, amen.  [Translation as of 05/21/22]</p>

10,Däbrä ʾƎnṣǝnā miracles: Abbot Raphael from Däbrä ʾƎnṣǝnā in Egypt and the sacrament of confession.,Africa Egypt probably,"<p>There was a church in the region of Upper Egypt, at the Monastery of Antinoé [Antinoöpolis], that had been constructed in the name of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, Mother of God.</p>
<p>The superior was named Abbâ Enâ. He had stayed in this monastery to take care of the prayer and of the monastery’s needs for many years.</p>
<p>Afterward, this holy man was named the Bishop Raphaël, for he was a blessed and holy man.</p>
<p>This event took place during the days of the Patriarch Abbâ Matthew. </p>
<p>When the Patriarch learned of the piety and the ascetic struggle of the Hégoumène monk,  he [Abbâ Matthew] sent to him [the monk, Bishop Raphaël] many letters of blessing so that he would be a consoling father, would receive in confession all the people who were there, and would give them penance [une pénitence]. </p>
<p>In fact, the custom in this country was to neither hear nor receive people’s confessions without the authorization of the patriarchs or of the bishops, because of the word that Jesus spoke to the apostles: “May what you bind on earth be bound in heaven, and may what you loose on earth be loosened in heaven.” </p>
<p>Likewise, our father bishops (prescribed)  that no priest receive a confession without the authorization of a superior.  But this Raphaël did not obey the command of the Patriarch, fearing for his soul to carry the sins of others.</p>
<p>The Father Patriarch Abbâ Matthew grieved for his subject and asked Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, Mother of God, to put in Raphaël’s heart  to hear the confession of his flock and to give them penance.</p>
<p>One day, while Raphaël was sleeping on his side, he saw [vit, a vision, so how “see”] a woman who shone seven times brighter than the sun. She appeared [apparut] to him, struck his chest with her palm, and said to him, “Raphaël, obey the Patriarch Matthew, do not transgress his command, and do not shatter the hope of sinners.”</p>
<p>Raphaël awoke from his sleep, placed his hand on his chest and found (the imprint of)  Our Lady Mary’s hand: on his chest (was the print of)  each of her fingers.</p>
<p>He hurried to the Patriarch and informed him of this.</p>
<p>Upon learning this, the Patriarch felt great joy and sent him a blessing and a mandate ?  so that he might obey the rule.</p>
<p>From this day, all the people gathered to confess their sins and repent. As for Raphaël, he was attentive to giving penances. </p>
<p>One day among these, a man came to him and confessed; his sin was very great.</p>
<p>When the man had spoken to Raphaël, he [Raphaël] took him [the man] into a cell, bound his feet, and commanded that he eat nothing but bread and salt, and drink (nothing but)  water until sunset.</p>
<p>After this, he took the key to the cell without the man’s knowing, went to the river, and threw it in.</p>
<p>He said, “O my Lady Mary, you commanded me to hear the confessions of sinners. You know that the sin of this man is very great and that he cannot carry it.” </p>
<p>The man stayed incarcerated for three years; he fell gravely ill, to the point of approaching death.</p>
<p>He began to cry before his wife and said, “I beg you, by God, to give me a bit of fish to eat before I die.”</p>
<p>As he pressed his wife, she said to him, “I will do nothing without the opinion of your (spiritual)  master.”</p>
<p>Then she went to the master of her husband and informed him of his [her husband’s] circumstances.</p>
<p>The master commanded her to go toward the river near a fisherman and to give him a dinar so that he might throw his net three times. He said to her (again) : “Give to your husband to eat the first fish that is caught; if the fish is caught on the second or third (time) , do not give it to him to eat, or he will die [et qu’il meure].”</p>
<p>She immediately left the master and did as he had commanded her.</p>
<p>And so the fisherman threw his net into the river three times, and he caught only one fish.</p>
<p>The woman took it and went to her husband with great joy.</p>
<p>When she opened the fish, she found the key in its stomach.</p>
<p>In the greatness of her joy, she did not give her husband the fish to eat, but she went to Raphaël and showed him the key to the cell. </p>
<p>When Raphaël the Bishop saw it, he praised God the Most High and His mother the Virgin.</p>
<p>He said to the woman, “My daughter, it was no other than Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, Mother of God, who showed mercy to your husband.”</p>
<p>Then he hurried to her husband and freed him with the key that had been found in the fish’s stomach. </p>
<p>He allowed him to partake in holy communion and absolved him of his penance so that he might eat and drink.</p>
<p>He said to this man, “So rejoice, for Our Lady Mary interceded for you with her beloved Son and your sin was remitted.”</p>
<p>After this, the man continued to celebrate the commemoration of Our Lady Mary, each month, with all honor and by giving alms to the poor and needy [aux pauvres et aux indigents].</p>
<p>He inherited eternal life through the intercession of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, Mother of God.</p>
<p>As for the imprint of her hand, it stayed on the chest of the hégoumène Raphaël, the man’s master, until the day of his death.</p>

11,Däbrä Qaləmon miracles: An Arab who has contempt for Saint Mary’s icon at Däbrä Qaləmon is punished during the time of Patriarch Gabriel IV of Alexandria (1370-1378),Africa Egypt confirmed (Däbrä Qaləmon),"<p>An elder named Solomon lived in the monastery of the great saint Samuel of Qalamon in the days of the honorable lord Patriarch Abba Gabriel [IV], the 86th patriarch of the Patriarchs of Alexandria.  </p>
<p>There was in the [monastery a] church constructed in Our Lady, the Virgin Mary’s name with an icon to her as well. Many great miracles and wonders were being revealed by that icon until the fame of her miracles was known in all the regions of Egypt and her provinces.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there were men from the Arab people, who did not know books, and some from among them went to the region of Sayeed to fulfill their [material] needs. God led them until they drew near the monastery in which the miracles of his mother the Virgin Mary were revealed.</p>
<p>After they drew [very] near, the Arab men asked passersby and were told that it was the Monastery of Qalamon, in which was the icon of the Our Lady, the Virgin Mary, and that the abbot’s name was Solomon.</p>
<p>Immediately, the Arab men turned off the road and went to that monastery we have been describing so that they could see the icon.</p>
<p>When they arrived at the monastery, the Abbot Solomon came out to receive them. He said to them, “Rest a little, until we bring you something to eat.”</p>
<p>But, they insisted that they would not eat or drink until they saw the icon of Our Lady, the Holy Virgin Mary.</p>
<p>He was delighted by this and led them into the church. There, he said to them, “Whatever you see me doing, you should do likewise.”</p>
<p>They replied, “Alright.”</p>
<p>After this [exchange], Solomon approached the icon, pulled aside the curtains over it, and bowed in front of it three times. Three of the Arab men did likewise.</p>
<p>Regarding the fourth man, however, a demon entered his heart. He said, “How can I bow before a work made by human hands?”</p>
<p>Due to the overwhelming obstinance of the demon who had entered his heart, the man dared to remove his clothes, turn his back on her holy icon, and mocked it. Then, with foolishness and wickedness of heart, he did things that cannot be spoken.</p>
<p>Then, he declared, “If there is power in this icon, let it be revealed against me.”</p>
<p>At that very moment, while his three friends were looking at him, his tongue came out, stretched out from his lips a whole measure; his teeth ground up and down, right and left; and he collapsed on his face, drawing near to death. </p>
<p>When his friends saw this, they said to this faithless man, “By the faith of Mary!” Then, they tearfully beseeched Solomon [to do something]. </p>
<p>When Solomon saw their weeping, he stretched out his hands to bring down the lit candle in front of the icon. He [then] took a little bit of oil, anointed the man’s tongue, and it pulled back into his mouth. </p>
<p>Immediately, Solomon heard a voice from the icon saying, “Dear Solomon, don’t tire yourself out on this man’s behalf. Judgment has come upon him from my son, that he should die in his city because he has blasphemed against me and my beloved son. Upon his arrival at Rif, he will die.”</p>
<p>And it happened [just as Mary had said]. When he arrived at Rif, he died a terrible death and went to Sheol.</p>
<p>May Christ forgive us and you who have not denied the miracles of Our Lady, the Holy Virgin Mary. May he save you from Satan’s attack, increasing your happiness, joyous health, and peace each month--by the intercession of the Holy Virgin Mary, the Mother of God. </p>

12,The composition of the Maṣḥafa ḥawi (Book of the Collector) by Patriarch Gabriel II of Alexandria (d. 1145),Africa confirmed,"<p>The miracle of our lady, the Holy Virgin Mary!</p>
<p>May her prayers and blessings be with our King Zara Yaqob, amen. </p>
<p>This miracle happened in the days of the venerable archbishop Abba Gabriel, the son of Tarik. </p>
<p>Abba Gabriel quarreled with his people because of [their hate for] an unworthy bishop whom he had appointed. The people ganged up against him and removed him from the appointment of the bishopric. Then, they appointed another archbishop in his stead.</p>
<p>However, Abba Gabriel rejoiced due to this, for God had saved him from the people’s wickedness. Immediately, he went to live in the monastery of the Holy Abba Pawli the First Monk.  Abba Gabriel started living as a hermit in a place near that monastery, which we mentioned previously, to seek the salvation of his soul and weep over his sins.</p>
<p>While there, he wrote a huge book on the basis of the Old and New Testaments and the stories of the saints. He named it the “Book of Hawi,” which means the book of “the collection of all good words, abundantly filled with instructions.”  He stayed there writing that book for three years. When he finished writing it, he added an anathema to prevent anyone from removing it from the Monastery of Abba Anthony [to which he wished to send it] and any monk from taking it to his cell for the book should be kept in the church, to be read by the monks in order to remember Abba Gabriel.</p>
<p>After writing this anathema, Abba Gabriel took the book and put it on a huge donkey, one [of the Monastery of] Abba Pawli’s donkeys. He then sent the book to the monastery of Abba Anthony, with one monk to deliver the book [safely] to the monks there and to come back. </p>
<p>While the monk was journeying to the Monastery of the Holy Abba Anthony, evil men, from among the Berbers, who did not know God, ambushed the monk on the road. They took the donkey and the book from the monk, and stripped him of his monastic habit. Moreover, they wanted to kill him. </p>
<p>But, they conversed with one another [first], “What’s the benefit to us of killing this monk? Look, we have taken everything he had with him and stripped him of his clothes. So, let’s leave him to go wherever he wants. If we arrive at [the marketplace of] Rif,  we will sell this book to one of the Christians for a high price, along with the donkey.” </p>
<p>After [deciding] this, they left for Rif.</p>
<p>After they left, the monk returned to Abba Gabriel and told him everything that had happened to him. The monk said to him, “My dear father, had not the prayer of Abba Pawli and your holy prayer saved me, they would have killed me!” </p>
<p>When Abba Gabriel heard this, he was terribly saddened. He immediately got up and went to the church of the Monastery of Holy Abba Pawli. He stood before the icon of Our Lady, the Pure Virgin Mary, that was in that church. There, he prostrated himself on the ground, and rolled all over the ground. He cast the [archbishopric] crown off of his head. </p>
<p>He declared, “I swear by the power of the great God and [the power of] your always acceptable prayer before your beloved son, I won’t eat or drink or leave your icon until you demonstrate your powers and take the book to the place I sent it.” </p>
<p>He stayed standing like this before the icon of Our Lady the Holy Virgin Mary for three days and three nights, without eating or drinking and without his crown. </p>
<p>At the end of the third day, Our Lady, the Holy Virgin Mary, appeared, and said to him, “Don’t be sad, dear Gabriel, the minister for my beloved son. Tomorrow you will see my miracles. I have destroyed those who took the book and it will reach the place where you sent it. Also, you will be returned to your bishopric as before because of your faith in me. However, don’t rush to appoint a person as a bishop before you examine his behavior; God has forgiven you [for this appointment].”</p>
<p>On that same day,  while the monks of [the monastery of] Holy Anthony were standing on top of the monastery’s wall, they saw a man from afar, with a loaded donkey going before him. The monks did not know what the donkey was carrying. </p>
<p>When the man approached the monastery’s gate, the monks came down from the wall to open the gate for him, receive him, and ask him where he came from. </p>
<p>When they opened the gate, however, they couldn’t find any one except the donkey, which was loaded with a book and a monastic habit, those that the Berbers took. </p>
<p>When they opened the book, they found the note  of the aforementioned Holy Father Archbishop, and the anathema against anyone who would take the book out of the Monastery. </p>
<p>[When they saw all this] the monks rejoiced. They hurried and loaded the donkey with the fruits of the monastery’s garden and sent it with one [of their] monks to the Monastery of Abba Pawli. </p>
<p>As soon as the monk [and the donkey] reached the Monastery of Abba Pawli, the monks there knew that it was their donkey. They asked the monk [about what happened]. He told them how the donkey came to the Monastery of Abba Anthony with a luminous man driving it. When the monks came down [from the fence to open the gate] they couldn’t find anyone except the donkey by itself carrying the book and the monastic habit. </p>
<p>When the monks [of the Monastery of Abba Pawli] heard this, they told it to Abba Gabriel. When Abba Gabriel heard [the news,] he praised the Lord and prostrated himself before the icon of Our Lady, the Holy Virgin Mary. He praised her and put his crown back on. </p>
<p>Then, he wrote down everything that had happened and sent it to the great Monastery of Abba Anthony. When the monks heard this, they praised the Lord, glorified the Lord’s name, and greatly honored his mother, the Virgin Mary. </p>
<p>That same year, the archbishop who was appointed in place of Abba Gabriel passed away. The people were shocked when they saw his passing, for they had appointed him by defrocking Abba Gabriel Son of Tarik. </p>
<p>After this, the people deliberated together [and decided] to bring Abba Gabriel back. They [went to him at the Monastery of Abba Pawli and] implored him to absolve and forgive them. And he absolved and forgave them. They wanted him to come back with them. But, he refused. </p>
<p>That night, when he was standing before the icon of Our Lady, the Holy Virgin Mary, she appeared to him again and said, “Don’t refuse to go with your people. For my beloved son commands that you return to your see.” </p>
<p>In the morning, Abba Gabriel told the people [who had come to the monastery] how Our Lady Mary appeared to him the night before and also before that[, the first time]. </p>
<p>When those people heard, they rejoiced greatly. They [went and] received blessings from the icon of the Virgin [in the Monastery of Abba Pawli]. Then, they took Abba Gabriel to [Lower] Egypt and put him on his throne, according to the custom for archbishops. All the bishops and Abba Gabriel’s flock rejoiced [at his return]. And, when they heard the news about the icon of Our Lady Holy Virgin Mary, they named her ‘The Compassionate One.’ </p>
<p>Meanwhile, those Berbers who took the donkey, the monastic habit, and the book, after traveling for one stadion,  were bitten by a snake and died a terrible death. Their flesh was devoured by wild animals. </p>
<p>The aforementioned book still exists in the Monastery of Abba Anthony. The monks read it but no one is allowed to take it out of the church because of the anathema. [That book became] a memorial to Our Lady, the Virgin Mary, and the miracles she did. </p>
<p>May the blessings of her prayers be with our king Zar’a Ya’qob, the son of King David, who is also called Constantine, forever and ever, Amen.[Translation as of 05/21/22]</p>

His mouth declared her praise, and his heart was filled with thoughts of her, and he ministered unto her with exceedingly great diligence and care; and he wrote the Book of her Miracles and History, and he ceased not to meditate upon the same at eventide and at morn.</p>
<p>And it came to pass that when he came nigh to finishing the writing of her praises, our Lady the Virgin Mary, the Majesty of Christian people, brought unto him glad tidings openly, and she said unto him, ""Give me the Book of my History and Miracles, which my beloved son hath made, into my hands."" </p>
<p>And she took the Book of her Miracles, and she opened it and read therein; and she was exceedingly pleased therewith. And she said unto him, ""Behold, O my beloved, thou hast toiled for me. Behold now, I am well pleased with thee and I give thanks unto thee, and the blessing of my beloved Son shall be upon thee and shall dwell in thy house, and He shall bless thy children and those that shall be descended from thee with the blessing of heaven, because thou hast written this Book for me""; and having said these words she disappeared from him.</p>
<p>And the Bishop rejoiced with an exceeding great joy because Mary had brought him glad tidings, and had shown herself unto him openly, and had spoken unto him mouth to mouth; Miracles of the Virgin Mary and he loved her the more and his heart was smitten with deep love for her. Then he meditated in his heart and said, ""Behold, I will exalt her honour and majesty, and I will add thereunto very much more than I have been wont to do aforetime."" </p>
<p>And he made a great festival, the like of which man had never made, in commemoration of Mary, not on the day of her glorious nativity, but before it, and he chose one day of all the days, and established the celebration of all the festival upon it, and he made regulations concerning it and confirmed it. And all the people of the city celebrate the festival unto this day according to the ordinance of the Bishop, and they keep the feast of the commemoration of Mary with joy and gladness.</p>

14,The composition of the Ethiopian praise hymn Wǝddāse Maryam by Ephraim the Syrian Potter,Africa Ethiopia confirmed,"<p>HEARKEN, O ye my fathers and my brethren, that we may declare unto you the great miracle that took place through our holy Lady, Mary the two fold Virgin, the God-bearer, which the holy fathers have narrated unto me, and God is my witness that I add nothing thereunto, and that I take nothing there from. Now they told us, saying: In the country of Syria there dwelt a certain man who was a potter, and he feared God, and loved our holy Lady, Mary the twofold Virgin, the God-bearer, and he ascribed praise unto her from the depth of his heart. And our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, appeared unto that potter at dawn on the second day of the week, in great majesty, and she was arrayed in light and angels followed her. And she said unto him, ""Peace be unto thee, O my beloved one, thou man beloved of my Son, I have come unto thee that thou mayest multiply thy praises of me, and that they may become for me an everlasting memo rial."" Then he said unto her, ""O my Lady, I am a worm and no man, and a castaway; how can I bless thee adequately? Nevertheless, bless thou me with thy holy hand, O thou storehouse of blessing."" Then she said unto him, ""The blessing of my Son, and the blessing of His Father, and the blessing of the Holy Spirit, be with thee. Amen."" </p>
<p>And when our holy Lady had thus spoken unto him the Holy Spirit came upon him in full measure, and he opened his mouth, and said, ""God willed to set Adam free from grief and sorrow of heart, and He restored him to the state wherein he had been of old""; and he recited the Praise of Mary for the second day of the week until the end thereof, and the Holy Spirit spake by his lips. And when he had finished praising her, our holy Lady, Mary the twofold Virgin, blessed him and saluted him, and gave him the words of peace, and she went up into heaven with great glory.</p>
<p>Then again on the third day she came unto him, and she said unto him, ""Peace be unto thee, O my beloved, thou shalt sing my praises this day even as the Holy Spirit shall teach thee."" And he said unto her, ""Bless me""; and she blessed him. And he opened his mouth and said, ""O thou crown in which we exult, thou woman who hath the pre-eminence! our holy Lady, Mary the two fold Virgin, the God-bearer, is the foundation whereon we build""; and he recited the Praise of Mary for the third day unto the end thereof. And she rejoiced, and blessed him, and gave him the salutation of peace, and went up into heaven with great glory. Then again on the fourth day our holy Lady came unto him, and said unto him, ""Peace be unto thee, O thou man of God,"" and she blessed him, and said unto him, ""Sing thou my praises according to thy wont."" Then he opened his mouth, and said, ""All the hosts of heaven say: Blessed art thou, O thou second heaven who art upon earth, our holy Lady, Mary the twofold Virgin, the God-bearer, the second heaven""; and he sang the praise of Mary for the fourth day unto the end thereof. And similarly on the fifth day she came unto him, and he praised her, saying, ""The tree that Moses saw in a flame of fire in the wilderness, the branches whereof were not consumed, was a similitude of our holy Lady, Mary the twofold Virgin, the God-bearer."" And he sang the Praise of Mary for the fifth day unto the end thereof. Then on the Eve of the Sabbath our holy Lady, Mary the twofold Virgin, appeared unto him, and she sat upon a shining throne and she said unto him, ""Peace be unto thee, O my beloved, sing thou my praise with thy sweet songs."" And he said unto her, ""Blessed art thou above women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, O Virgin, the God-bearer."" And he sang the Praise of Mary for the sixth day unto the end thereof, and she blessed him and made him to rejoice, and she went up to heaven with great glory. And in like manner on the first day of the week, the Sabbath, our holy Lady came and said unto him, ""Joy be unto thee, O my beloved, and peace""; and rising up he prostrated himself before her. Then she said unto him, ""Sing thou my praises this day also, even as the Holy Spirit shall give thee understanding""; and he said unto her, ""Bless me""; and she blessed him. And he opened his mouth and said, ""The woman who is pure, and glorious, and holy in everything did clasp God in her hand, and all created things do rejoice with her, and cry out, and say, Rejoice, O thou that art full of grace, rejoice, for thou hast found favour; rejoice, for God is with thee."" And when he had made an end of praising her, she saluted him and went up into heaven with great glory.</p>
<p>Now when the evening of the Sunday had come he drank wine and fell asleep. And when it was midnight our holy Lady appeared unto him, and said, ""Why didst thou not praise me to-day with praises more numerous than those of the other days? For the praises for this day should be more numerous than those of the other days."" And he said unto her, ""O my Lady, this day is the Sabbath of rest, and men do no work therein."" Then she said unto him, ""Rise up, and fear not, and stand in the place of thy [daily] labour, and what soever the Holy Spirit shall give thee understanding to say, that say."" Then rising up he received a blessing from her, and he kissed the cross that was in her hand. And he stood up in his workshop wherein he was wont to fashion his vessels of clay, and he opened his mouth and said, ""Thou hast been called 'Love,' O most blessed of women, and thou art a second moon who art called the holy of holies, wherein are the Tables of the Covenant."" Then he sang three portions of her praises, and he went on singing until the morning. And when the morning had come she blessed him and said unto him, ""Joy be with thee, O my beloved one. As thou hast caused me to rejoice by singing praises unto me upon earth, even so will I make thee to rejoice in the kingdom of heaven. As thou hast commemorated me by singing my praise upon earth, even so will I give unto thee in the kingdom of heaven as the reward of thy labour the joy that never endeth."" And this she did, according as she had led him to hope. And now, O my beloved brethren, see how great is the love that God and our holy Lady have towards the sons of men for the sake of a little praise; and see, too, that in return for a few good works our Lady will come down from heaven to him that loveth her and celebrateth her memorial.</p>
<p>Praisings and glorifications are meet for thee In the mouths of angels and men who dwell everywhere, O Mary the Virgin, O Mary of the sweet-smelling mouth! Like the potter beloved by thee I offer unto thee salutation, And the commemoration of thy name which is more pleasant than spices and perfumes.</p>

15,"Amnut, the custodian of a church in Egypt, quarrels with his bishop.",Africa Egypt probably,"<p>A miracle of our Our Lady, Holy Virgin Mary, Mother of God, may her prayers and blessings be with her servant, Lebna Dengel, forever and ever amen.</p>
<p>There was a church built in the name of Our Lady, Holy Virgin Mary, in one of the cities of [the region of] Sayeed [in Upper Egypt? Do research], under the appointment of a [particular] bishop. In this church was a man [with the title of] amnut, that is, the custodian of the church. </p>
<p>And he was pledged from his youth to be a servant of the church all the days of his life, and to be pure and holy, without blemish, never knowing a woman.</p>
<p>Near and far, all the people of the region adored him because of his purity, holiness, and virginity, and also love for serving the church of Our Lady, the Virgin Mary, because he loved her with all his heart and would serve her with all his might.</p>
<p>When the bishop of that city passed away, the people grieved and the entirety of his flock mourned due to [the loss of] their shepherd and the guardian of their souls. And the people sent messengers to the patriarch in order to inform him about the passing of the bishop. And the patriarch sent a message to comfort them, in accordance with custom,  and so that they would gather in the fear of God to choose the most appropriate person for this office.</p>
<p>And so they gathered the priests, the deacons, the monks, and the faithful and they remained in the church for three days, supplicating God with fasting and prayer so that God would reveal to them the one who would be most suitable for this office. They were united by the counsel of the Holy Spirit to select the custodian of the Church of Our Lady, the Holy Virgin Mary, due to his goodness and righteousness. Having deliberated, they sent a message about his selection to the patriarch.</p>
<p>When he read the written letter, the patriarch rejoiced that God had prepared a shepherd to tend for them. After this, he sent the Book of the Sacraments  to the custodian, so that the custodian would [know that he should] come see the patriarch.</p>
<p>When the custodian came, the patriarch told him the reason why he had summoned him. When the custodian heard the reason, he mourned bitterly and wept, begging the patriarch to swear that he would not appoint him.</p>
<p>And the custodian said, “I am poor and lacking knowledge and sinful. I am not deserving of this noble office. Moreover, I was pledged from my youth to serve Our Lady, the Holy Virgin Mary, all the days of my life. So, father, release me [from this duty,] for the sake of the name of Our Lady, the Holy Virgin Mary.”</p>
<p>And when the patriarch saw his tears, he released him [from this duty]. </p>
<p>And then the patriarch sent word, informing the people of that region about the matter of the Custodian and how he refused the appointment of his bishopric over them. He said they should select another one most appropriate for this office. </p>
<p>When they heard this report, the people grieved but they couldn’t [bring themselves to] disobey the word of the patriarch.</p>
<p>They chose a certain priest from that church and sent him to the patriarch with his servant. </p>
<p>The patriarch appointed the priest as the bishop over them and handed back the custodian mentioned previously.</p>
<p>So the patriarch said to the [new] bishop, “Love the Custodian with all your heart and mind because he is a holy man who has conquered the glory of this fleeting world and does not desire appointment, obedience, or exultation. The Custodian fears the people’s sins, that God might hold him responsible for them [and their sins] as God demands of every shepherd for the sake of their flock.” </p>
<p>The bishop said: “Yes, father, I will do as you have ordered me.”</p>
<p>Having bid one another farewell, the bishop and his servant departed from him. When they arrived in their region, the people accepted them with great joy. They led them into the House of Our Lady Holy Virgin Mary and sat them upon the throne according to their custom. The bishop set up Amnut, whom we told you about previously, to be a servant of our church according to his [Amnut’s] custom [as he had been before].</p>
<p>The bishop remained completely in love with Amnut for three years and did not do anything to test him. </p>
<p>But when the wicked satan, enemy of good things, saw their love, he became jealous of them. He placed evil [thoughts] into the bishop’s heart to make him hate Amnut whenever evil people accused him. Satan taught the people to speak falsely to the bishop about Amnut claiming that he was not a believer, that he slandered the bishop and said many [evil] things against him; that he was always saying: “This bishop is not deserving of this office. Moreover, if I had been here [rather than with the patriarch when he was chosen] then I would not have agreed with the people choosing him. But when this priest came to the patriarch to save me from this office and from the sins of the people,  I kept silent about this misgiving.”</p>
<p>When the bishop heard this [false] account, he summoned Amnut and took all the possessions of the Church [from his care]. The bishop drove out Amnut from the Church even before he told him his sins. and before he joined him with the ones who accused him falsely.  </p>
<p>When Amnut was expelled from the Church he grieved bitterly on the account of his expulsion from it and on account of his service for Our Lady Holy Virgin Mary and on account of his consecration to her that he would serve all the days of his life. When the wicked satan learned of his despair, he brought against him a thought, which said: “Why did you decline the office [of bishopric]? If you were a bishop then all of the churches would be under your hand. So leave this one church and then this bishop might be under your rule, and therefore what he has done to you is to your benefit.” </p>
<p>When Satan made him think these things, Amnut grieved bitterly and was enraged. Then he remained, for an entire year, pleading for intercession from bishops near and far and from priests, monks, and the faithful believers, so that the bishop may teach him and make him understand his sins. But that bishop did not listen to him and refused to inform him, for Satan had hardened the heart of the bishop against Amnut.</p>
<p>However, when one of his friends saw the abundance of grief and weeping, he said to Amnut: “O my beloved brother, my grief is heavy for you because of what this bishop has done to you. But you deserved this and even more from him, for you have refused the office of the bishopric. So now, if you hear what I have to say and you obey, I could make this bishop return you to your previous office and he will love you exceedingly. But do not refuse what I tell you.”</p>
<p>[Amnut said:] “O my brother, God is my witness that my grief is not about the love of this office but about my service to the church of Our Lady Holy Virgin Mary because I have been consecrated to her so that I may serve her all my life.”</p>
<p>He said to Amnut: “I have a friend. Get up, let’s go to him and he will fulfill everything you want.” </p>
<p>And then he took him and guided him to a magician. He said to the magician: “This man is my friend. Look, the bishop has driven him out of his office. I want you to return him back to his office.”</p>
<p>The magician said: “If this man obeys my advice, then the bishop will return him to his office tomorrow. In the evening and in the daytime bring him to me and I will tell him everything that he needs to do.”</p>
<p>When it became evening, his friend took him and brought him to the magician. But Amnut did not know that that man was a magician.</p>
<p>Fol. 73v, col. 1, line 2</p>
<p>And after nightfall, the magician took them and lead Amnut and his friend to the graveyard of the transgressors [those not buried in a church graveyard]. Then, that magician began to speak with them, just as he was taught by Satan. </p>
<p>When the magician had finished this matter [of speaking with the dead], they heard a voice crying out in the midst of the graves, saying, “If that man would fulfill his desire [of getting his office back], he should write a letter with his [own] hand denying his Lord Christ and his Mother. And he should believe in Satan, Christ’s enemy and bring that letter here tomorrow evening. Then, we will fulfill what he desires and  make the bishop return him to his office the very moment that he denies [Christ and Mary].”</p>
<p>When Amnut heard this, he became heart sick and his soul longed to divorce his flesh. And he said, “It would be better for me to die than to do this thing!”</p>
<p>His friend shushed him, saying “Do this and afterward, you can repent. The mercy of God is great. And God will know that you have done this due to your love of service in the Church of Our Lady, the Holy Virgin Mary.”</p>
<p>His friend and the magician didn’t cease saying this until they convinced him. They got him to write his letter of denial and the next evening the three of them arrived at the previously mentioned graveyard. Amnut tied his letter of denial to the top of his staff  and, standing in the midst of the graves, he raised it up. One of the evil spirits took the letter from the top of his staff.</p>
<p>And they heard a voice saying to them, “This man should go swiftly to his house because the bishop has sent his helper at this very moment to ask him to reconcile with him and to return to his place [in the church].”</p>
<p>And when the three heard this message, they went at once to Amnut’s house. Amnut was now a believer in what Satan could do. </p>
<p>And they found the bishop’s helper at the house gate, searching for Amnut to go with him to the bishop. They set out together, but because the helper was delayed, the bishop had [already] left to go Amnut’s house and he found them on the way.</p>
<p>When the helper and Amnut saw the bishop, he bowed down to Amnut, “my dear brother and son, forgive me, for the sake of God and his mother, the Virgin. For I have wronged the pure Virgin and you as well!”</p>
<p>In turn, Amnut bowed down to the earth, weeping greatly, and they embraced one another. Amnut then journeyed with the bishop to the church, where the bishop gave him the keys to the church and all its possessions [, those he had taken before,] and returned Amnut to his previous office.</p>
<p>But, when Amnut saw that everything had happened, due to Satan’s command, he repented the things he had done. Then Satan placed despair in his heart regarding God’s mercy.</p>
<p>Immediately, a good thought came to him, to place his trust in God’s mercy and Our Lady, the Holy Virgin Mary’s mercy, who saves whomever asks her from every torment and sin. </p>
<p>There was an icon in the name of Our Lady, the Holy Virgin Mary, in that church. When the priest and people finished praying and had gone out, they closed the gates of the church [leaving him inside]. But he was still standing before her icon, weeping bitterly and prostrating and asking her to intercede on his behalf to her beloved son and to save him from his going astray, into which Satan the wicked had caused him to fall. </p>
<p>And he said, “My dear lady, I know that my sin is terrible, but you know that I [only] committed this sin on account of my love for the service of your church. I have sinned in not placing my confidence in you. Please, don’t dwell upon my sin. Rather, dwell upon the mercy of your beloved son, who, when Peter the apostle denied Christ but quickly repented, weeping bitterly for his sins, Christ forgave his sins. So, ask your son for forgiveness of my sins because I know that he will not deny your request.”</p>
<p>He acted like this the entire night, [prostrating, weeping, and praying]. </p>
<p>He fasted every third day, eating only dry bread and water. He remained like this for forty days, not joining the people in prayer. During the liturgy, he would not receive the Eucharist, nor touch the [Eucharistic] chalice with his hands nor serve. Instead of him, one of his family members raised the [Eucharistic] chalice.  </p>
<p>The Bishop was marveling at this [behavior]. The people didn’t know what was going on with Amnut. </p>
<p>He completed forty days and forty nights in great struggle, weeping bitterly in front of the icon of Our Lady, the Holy Virgin Mary. His mouth looked bloody from all his prostrating. </p>
<p>While he was doing all this, a voice from the icon said, “Rejoice, so-and-so, for my beloved son has accepted your request on your own behalf, and has shown mercy to you. So, in the morning, when the bishop and all the people come to the church, go to the Bishop, confess the sins you have done, and tell the bishop to gather all the people, the priests, and the monks. Have them stand before my icon and have them recite forty times the prayer my beloved son taught them, Kyrie Elison, which translates as, ‘O Lord have mercy on us; O Lord have mercy on us.’ After this, they will see my son and his wonders.”</p>
<p>When Amnut heard this voice from the holy altar, he rejoiced greatly and became like a lion, who waits to tear apart his enemy Satan, and became like a drunk person, due to his joy. And, when morning came, he went to the Bishop and told him everything that had happened. </p>
<p>The Bishop heard this and was amazed, and said to him, “Satan wanted to destroy the two of us together.” They went to the church and bowed in front of the icon, three hundred prostrations, because she had saved them from destruction. </p>
<p>The Bishop gathered the priests and all the people. He commanded Amnut to declare the sins he had committed [in front of everyone] and he told them everything that had happened to him.</p>
<p>And when the people heard this, they praised God. </p>
<p>The Bishop took his crown from his head, and all the priests prostrated themselves in front of the icon of Our Lady, the Holy Virgin Mary, saying, “Our Father Who Art in Heaven” twelve times and the “Kyrie Elison” forty-four times. </p>
<p>At that moment, Amnut’s letter of denial fell off the top of the icon onto the head of the bishop. And he lifted it and he read it. After this, he washed Amnut’s letter of denial in front of the icon.  </p>
<p>After the people had seen this, they rejoiced, worshiped God and praised the Virgin because she had saved the soul of their shepherd, the bishop and Amnut their friend.</p>
<p>After this, the Bishop prayed over the oil and he baptized Amnut and he performed the liturgy and appointed him as priest over the church. And he administered to him the Holy Eucharist. Then he prepared a marvelous banquet for the people, inviting the great and the small, the poor and needy to the remembrance of the Virgin in that church, each year during the observation of the feast of our Lady Holy Virgin Mary just as on that [first] day with great joy [that continues] until today. </p>
<p>And so now, dear beloved Christian children do not go to magicians nor to sorcerers or seers because all of these people will lead you to death and ruin and destruction in this world and also in the world to come. It will take you down into Sheol where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth. </p>
<p>May the intercession of that Virgin be with Her servant Ləbnä Dəngəl forever and ever, Amen.[Translation as of 05/21/22]</p>

In order to fulfil their desire they set out to sail there, but the waves were too strong for them, and they were unable to make headway against them, and the billows were about to swallow them up. </p>. <p>And the Arabs, in accordance with the custom of their fathers, prayed [for help] to their false Prophet, but they did not find deliverance. And when they had abandoned all hope of saving their lives, one of them who had visited the Monastery of Kalmon, and had seen the miracles that were wrought there, cried out, ""O Mary of the Monastery of Kalmon, who didst once make intercession for me, deliver thou me. If thou wilt deliver me from drowning in this sea, I will give to thy church a camel's load of dates for the food of the monks, and the camel also shall belong to the monastery, so that it may carry whatsoever the monks choose to lay upon it."" And his companion said, ""Yea, verily thou hast done well to mention this great name."" And when their companion heard this speech he laughed at them, and said, ""O dogs, why do ye forsake your faith and make entreaty for mercy to Mary?"" And at that very moment he was overwhelmed by the sea, and a crocodile swallowed him up, but in order that the man's companions might see him, and the miracle might be made manifest unto them, the creature brought him up again and held him in his mouth.</p> <p>Then the two Arabs made supplication unto our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, and they came to a mighty rock, and they climbed up on it and stood up on it in the midst of the raging waves. And a ship that was passing that way came to them, and they embarked therein, and came safely to the port to which it was sailing. Then straightway the Arab took a camel, which was the finest of his camels, and having laden it with dates he brought it to Solomon, the Abbot of the Monastery of Kalmon, and to all the monks, and he related unto them everything that had taken place.</p><p> Now the Arab's companion possessed many sheep, and he sheared their wool and brought it to the monks, and said, ""Take this wool and make of it clothing for yourselves, for the sake of our Lady Mary who delivered me from drowning.""

17,"Nəkʷal, the deacon from Margawkim in Egypt, who spent his Muslim master’s money on the poor.",Africa Egypt probably,"<p>There was a Christian deacon from the people of Marg and Kem  and his name was Nekwal.  He was a scribe for one of the chief army officers from the nobles of the Muslims. </p>
<p>Nekwal loved Our Lady, the Holy Virgin Mary, and he donated all that he had for the sake of her name. He observed her feast every month, on the 21st. </p>
<p>One year, during that time, a great famine arrived in the land of Egypt. And that deacon gave all that he possessed or had authority over for the sake of Our Lady, the Virgin Mary, up to and including all the food of his lord the prince [and officer] that he had in hand. </p>
<p>When the famine worsened in Egypt, his lord [the officer] sent word to Nekwal, saying, “Send food for my children and the people of my house.” </p>
<p>But, the messengers didn’t find Nekwal with any food at all. The city’s people told the messengers that Nekwal had dispersed the food to the poor and needy. </p>
<p>So, the people sent the messengers to relate this report to their lord [the officer]. That lord ordered them to imprison Nekwal and bring him to him. When Nekwal arrived in Egypt, they put him in prison until [such time as] he would bring all the food that he had squandered or renounced his faith and became a Muslim. If he refused, he would be beheaded. </p>
<p>When they put Nekwal inside the prison, he was heartsick and grieved bitterly. He said, “I am a weak, poor man, whose body is unable to withstand the pain of torture. Nonetheless, I will be steadfast and prepare for death, which is on account of my faith.”  </p>
<p>After this, he waited until the middle of the night and then he wrote on a page, “My dear Lady Virgin Mary, you know that I love you, that I have served you all the days of my life, and that I gave you all that I had for the sake of your name. Do not forsake me now, at this hour. [Let] your intercession [be] on my behalf this time, so that the Muslims may not mock the Christians and they may not say, ‘If this Christian gave alms for the sake of her name, why won’t she save him?’” </p>
<p>For he had been giving [food] to everyone, Christians and Muslims, and he [always] said, “Take this on account of the name of the Virgin Mary.” </p>
<p>Then, Nekwal took the page, attached it on [the top of] a tall staff, [held it up,] and began to recite the following Psalm until its end, “‘God shines for me and saves me—what should I fear? God is trustworthy regarding my life—what should terrify me?’” </p>
<p>Then Nekwal said the Kyrie Eleison forty-one times.  Upon completing that, he heard a voice from above the prison, saying, “Do not be afraid tomorrow. For you will see my beloved Son’s power to save you and, in the year  that he comes [the second time,] you will rejoice, be delighted, and inherit eternal life.”</p>
<p>When it became morning, the sultan summoned the officer who had imprisoned Nekwal the Christian. Then, the sultan commanded [his] men to drown the officer in the sea. After, he sent for Nekwal the Christian, untied him, and brought him out of the prison. </p>
<p>As for Nekwal, he went to the monastery of the blessed Saint Abuna Anthony and became a monk there, where he told them about the vision [of the Virgin Mary] that he had seen. </p>
<p>But the next year, he disputed with the Muslims about their faith, and they beheaded him. For the sake of the name of Christ, he became a martyr.</p>

18,The priest from Nārdin in Egypt who was accused because he kept a nun in his house,,"<p>A man in the town of Nardin was appointed as a priest in the Church of the Virgin for that town. He was young and handsome, pure and refined in body, and excellent in his work.</p>
<p>In that city was [also] a beautiful nun. She had expectations of this priest and she arranged for him to be her teacher. So, she went to him all the time for comfort and to tell him of all of the lusts/ desires of her thought because Satan was fighting with her constantly.</p>
<p>The priest was afraid for her because of this act [of fighting with Satan] and he commanded her to stay with him.</p>
<p>After this, they went to the church of Our Lady Mary, the Pure Virgin, and they stood in front of her icon and asked her to preserve them from the accursed hater [Satan’s] schemes. They made a pact to keep their souls and their flesh in righteousness and purity all the days of their lives. They put their trust in God and his mother, the Virgin Mary.</p>
<p>After this, they left the church, and the priest brought her back to his house.</p>
<p>When the nun stayed with him, the townspeople disparaged him saying, “How can this handsome priest stay with that beautiful young nun who has a pleasing appearance?”</p>
<p>When the townspeople had heard the report of their staying together, they were stirred up by this slander.</p>
<p>The priest was serving [in the church] all the time and administering the Eucharist.</p>
<p>[WLB: f. 73v, col. 2, 2 lines from bottom]</p>
<p>And those who slandered him did not receive it on the days that he was administering it. And his report reached the archbishop of Mardin, he was saddened because of this matter. After this he sent a priest, an elder monk, one of his disciples  whom he entrusted with his secrets. He ordered him to go to the church and be present during the time of the liturgy, and after the eucharist to go with the priest to his house so that he might observe the nun who was with the priest and to closely examine their actions and to return the report back to him because it is the custom of a priest to receive a visitor and take him to his house with him, and eat together with him at his table. </p>
<p>When the messenger of the archbishop arrived at the church and then he spent the night there and when the morning came the priest administered the liturgy of the eucharist according to his custom. During the liturgy that elder monk, the messenger of the archbishop, saw a pillar of light coming down from the top of the church upon the priest and the altar. As he made the sign of the cross over the bread and the cup, the light came down in the appearance of a hand and it was making the cross with him over the holy eucharist and the people. And he was astonished. When the liturgy was complete the elder monk partook in the holy eucharist. </p>
<p>After the people partook in it and the priest blessed them and removed the priestly garments and brought the elder into his house to host him. When he brought him in, he called the nun so that she might be blessed by the elder priest [the visitor]. When he [the visitor] saw her, he marveled at her youthful appearance. Her teacher commanded her to serve the meal. After she served the meal, he ordered her to sit and eat with them. The elder priest [visitor] said “Our father the bishop ordered me not to eat with women”, and he said to him “My dear father, you eat by yourself and after you have eaten, we will eat from the scraps of your blessing. As for me, I have been eating from the same plate as this sister for many days”. When the elder heard this from him, he was very troubled and bewildered by what he had seen in church in contrast with his eating with the woman.  After the elder finished eating, they took what was left over from him and they ate together while he observed them and their eyes were cast down onto the ground. </p>
<p>When they finished the meal, they remained there and they declared God’s praise to one another. After this, the elder delivered the archbishop’s message to the young priest and he said to him: “Tell me what [message] I should bring back to him”. And he [the young priest] replied: “Tomorrow I will tell you what to say”. The elder spent the night with him and when the dawn broke the young priest said to the elder, the messenger of the archbishop: “My dear father, I want you to take a few gifts from me and bring them to the archbishop. However, make an agreement with me in front of the icon of our Lady Mary that you will not look at the gift before you are in the presence of the archbishop.” And he [the elder monk] made an agreement with him about the matter.</p>
<p>After this he went inside his house and he took two wooden boxes, lined them with linen  and on the linen he placed red-hot fiery coals, and on the coals he again placed linen. He did likewise many times - linen and fire, until he filled the boxes, and closed them, and sent them to the archbishop with the elder messenger.</p>
<p>When the elder arrived to the archbishop he told him that the priest sent a gift to him. Having heard this, he [the archbishop] became furious with the elder. He said to the elder: “I sent you to investigate his action because of the accusations of the people who slander him. If this actually took place, I would cut him off from the priesthood. But you brought me a bribe from him. As God lives, I will not take anything from him”. After the disciple saw the wrath of the archbishop he told him everything that he had seen in the church during the liturgy of the eucharist and how a pillar of light descended upon him and hovered above the altar, and how the light, which was like a hand, blessed the bread and the cup with him, and how he had entered his house and he saw the nun with him, how he [the young priest] had eaten together with her, and how she was very beautiful and how he [the young priest] made him swear at that time and give him [the elder monk] the boxes that he [the elder monk] should not open and should not see what is inside them until he was in the presence of the archbishop. The messenger said to the archbishop: “I am asking you, my dear father, by the passion of our Lord Jesus Christ that you open the boxes and see what is inside them. After this let the will of the Lord be done.” </p>
<p>When the archbishop heard his disciple’s report, he was astonished. He accepted his petition, received the boxes from him and opened them with his own hands. When he saw the linen, it was not burnt and also the fire had not gone out. He knew that this was a divine mystery. He was astonished and he marveled and praised God who guards his servants who trust in Him.</p>
<p>At the time he got up and took his disciple with him and the boxes. When he arrived at the church in which was the young priest, he gathered the people of this city and their neighbors and he brought out the priest and the nun, then he brought out the boxes in front of all the people. He showed them the fiery coals on the linen, and the linen did not burn and the fiery coals did not extinguish. When they saw this, they marveled and praised God because of everything they had seen. Then the archbishop excommunicated that priest who had told the story that he [the young priest] was with a nun. The archbishop then told all the people thus, how the young priest and the nun made a vow before the icon of Our Lady the Virgin Mary and asked her to guard them and immediately all the people asked the archbishop to forgive them on account of their accusing the young priest. And they recognized that it was Our Lady the Virgin Mary who had performed this miracle and she had revealed her power with the linen and the fiery coals and she had delivered them from slander. That young monk and the nun remained serving the church of Our Lady Mary until the day they died. Three days before their death, Our Lady was revealed to them and she said to them: “Three days from now you will come to me”. When it was the third day, the priest died on the third hour and on the ninth hour of that same day the nun died. They prepared them for burial and the people prayed over them and they buried them in a single tomb within the church that they had served. </p>
<p>May the intercession of this pure virgin Mary be with him and may it save our king, Zar’a Ya’qob who is called Constantine, from the attacks of the enemy. Forever and ever. Amen.[Translation as of 05/21/22]</p>

19,"The monk, Yǝsḥaq, of Alexandria who prayed for seven years that Saint Mary would appear to him during the time of Patriarch Gabriel II of Alexandria (d. 1145)",Africa Egypt probably,"VI THE VIRGIN MARY AND ISAAC THE MONK [A. Fol. 13a, 1; B. Fol. 18a, 1.] NOW there was in this holy monastery, which was renowned in the days of the Abbuna Abba Gabriel, Archbishop of Alexandria, a certain holy monk who had lived there from his youth, and his name was Isaac, and he loved our Lady with all his might. And he prepared for himself certain work to do without any man knowing about it, and he was the guardian of the church, and the key thereof was in his hand. And after the prayer which was to be said before sleep was ended, and when the monks had gone into their cells to sleep, Isaac used to go to the church, and having opened the door he would go inside it, and stand up before the picture of our Lady, the holy Virgin Mary, which was on the western wall, the whole night long. And he would begin to say the prayer of the Gospel, and he would make three hundred prostrations before her, and say at each prostration, ""O my Lord Jesus Christ, make me to see Thy Mother""; and he continued to do this for seven years, and no man knew anything about these prostrations. And it came to pass, at the end of the seven years, on a certain night of the festival of our Lady the Virgin, that is to say, the twenty-first day of the month of Takhshash (December 17), when Isaac was prostrating himself before the picture (or, image) of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, that she came forth from her picture (or, image) and she shone with an exceedingly great splendour which was seven times brighter than lightning. And she said unto him, ""Why hast thou wearied thyself [in entreating] my beloved Son to show thee her who gave Him birth? Behold, I am the Mother of Life, the woman who gave birth to Jesus Christ; command me, and I will come to thee, and whatsoever thou desirest that will I do for thee."" And he said unto her, ""O my Lady, I beseech thee to make supplication on my behalf to thy beloved Son."" And she said unto him, ""Behold, God Almighty hath received thy petition, and He hath commanded me to come unto thee, and to fulfil thy desire; and three days hence thou shalt be where I am."" And it came to pass that, when he heard her words and saw her beauty and saw that she was crowned with light, he fell down upon the ground and became like unto a dead man. Then did she take hold of him with her hand and lift him up. And she disappeared from him into the picture that was before him. Then straightway Isaac went into his cell, and the sickness of fever fell upon him, and in the morning he called for the bishop of the city, whose name was Abraham, who chanced to be dwelling in the monastery that day, and when he came Isaac made known unto him all that he had seen. And Isaac said unto him, ""O my father, release me from all the bonds of [my] sin, for I dared to beseech God to show me her who gave Him birth, a thing for which I was unfit."" And he released him, and said unto him, ""O my son, if thou goest to God make thou mention of me, so that I may find mercy on the day of the Great Judgement."" And at the end of the third day Isaac died, and he inherited life everlasting, even as our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, had promised him. Isaac the monk, having wished and desired greatly, Saw thy beautiful face on a certain day. As thou didst speak unto him until he rejoiced exceedingly.

20,The Arab woman who suffered from an issue of blood for many years and is healed by Mary's icon,Africa Egypt probably,"<p>Miracle 30 of our Lady Holy Virgin Mary, may her prayers and her blessings be with our king Zara Yaeqob, amen.</p>
<p>And there was a woman from the Arab women and she had a flow of blood for many years and she gave all her possessions to doctors, but she did not receive healing. </p>
<p>And when she heard about the miracle that had been revealed by the icon of our Lady Virgin Mary which was in the monastery of Saint Abba Samuel of Qalamun and [also] the misfortune that befell that certain old man who ridiculed the icon and ridiculed Solomon the abbot , then she got up in great faith and she arrived at the monastery of Saint Abba Samuel.</p>
<p>And there was on the top of the citadel of the monastery a priest named Rəzqäla (ርዝቀላ), which means “God is gracious”. He was a brother of Solomon the abbot.</p>
<<p>Standing on the top of the citadel, he saw the dust-cloud of many people and their camels on the road. And he thought that monks had come to visit the monastery. But when they approached the monastery, that woman began to cry out and she said “I beg you to swear to me by God, dear monks, send Solomon to me so that I can tell him one matter concerning a sickness that I have. Thus I might find a cure and healing by his prayer.” </p>
<p>And the monk said to her “Dear woman, indeed, Solomon is just a poor man. Rather, power and healing belong to the Virgin Mary. As for Solomon, he has gone to the city of Rif to complete the materials needs of the monks.”</p>
<p>And at once the woman wept bitterly and she grieved because she had not found Solomon at the monastery. But when that priest saw her crying, he had compassion upon her because a woman could not enter according to the custom of the monastery.</p>
<p>And so that priest descended from the citadel and he took a small amount of vinegar and he went to the lantern that was lit in front of the icon of our Lady Holy Virgin Mary. And he took a small amount of oil  and he mixed it with apple [juice] , which was the vinegar. Then he said “My dear Lady, for the sake of the Passion of your beloved Son, do not put to shame the hope of that woman. And do not let her labor and her arrival at this monastery be in vain.”</p>
<p>And after this he went out to her and to those who were with her. He said to the woman “Do not cry, but set your confidence upon God and upon Mary his mother. And you will be healed from your sickness. But rather take this one piece of bread and break it into pieces into this oil which was lit in front of the icon of the Virgin Mary and into this vinegar which was mixed with it.”</p>
<p>And then he showed her a place to spend the night beside the monastery and they hosted the people who were with her according to the custom of visitors/pilgrims. And he fed food to their horses and the woman went to the place that he showed her and she spent the night there.</p>
<p>And in the morning she came to them rejoicing and she said that her flow of blood had dried up a little bit. And then she asked the priest and he did what he had done previously for three days.</p>
<p>And on the third day she was cured from her affliction.</p>
<p>And she gave to the monastery a kəlkalä , which are silver rings that were on her feet. And then she returned to her land.</p>
<p>And this miracle was heard among all the Arabs.  And all who had afflictions and sickness came to this monastery and they were anointed with the oil of the lantern that was lit in front of the icon of our Lady Mary the Virgin. And they were healed from all of their affiliations. And the miracle of that icon is revealed until today. May her intercession be with our king Zara Yaeqob forever and ever amen and amen.[Translation as of 05/21/22]</p>

22,The lamp before the icon of Saint Mary that the priest tipped over and yet remained suspended.,Europe probably,"<p>A miracle of our Our Lady, Holy Virgin Mary, may her prayers and blessings be with our king Zara Ya’eqob, amen. </p>
<p>There was a certain church in the name of our pure Lady Mary and in it an icon in her name on the right side of the wall. That icon was very big and was hung in between oil lamps  adorned in ivory and ebony whose workmanship was astonishing.</p>
<p>Everyone who saw that icon and the oil lamps would say “There is nothing like it.” </p><p>The icon was elevated above the ground about 10 cubits or more. </p>
<p>Day and night they lit a lamp with pure oil in front of the icon. Miracles and wonders were revealed from it.</p>
<p>Anyone who entered the church would stand in front of the icon and make a vow to it so that everything that he asked [of it] may be done for him.</p>
< p>One night, a priest entered the church to conduct the midnight prayer. After he opened the gate of the church, he went to the icon and prostrated before it; and he was blessed by it. After this, he stretched out his hand to the lamp that he had lit in front of the icon to bring it down from above so that he could be blessed by the oil that was in front of the icon. But when he pulled the rope upon which the lamp was hung, that lamp fell towards the ground.</p>
<p>Immediately, the priest said “O my dear Lady Virgin, help me!” The instant he finished saying this, he saw the lamp resting with its rope upon the ground. [He also saw that] the oil that was inside it along with the water did not spill from it nor did it drip a single drop. Moreover, the lamp was burning as it had been before.</p>
<p>He picked up the lamp from the ground and he brought the [links of the] chains [from the lamp] onto his ears and was blessed by the oil that was on them. Then he returned the [links of the] chains to their hook as it had been before because they  were restored by the burning of the fire’s light. So he hung it up and was blessed by the icon. Then he entered the church and finished the midnight prayer.</p>
<p>When morning came, he told the priests and the people of the miracles of Our Lady The Holy Virgin that he had seen. </p>
<p>The people rejoiced and increased the fame of the icon and its ministry. From that day forward, they hung many lamps in front of the icon and lit many lights and they read the miracles there on every feast day and Sabbath. And anyone who was sick or ill would come to this church. They would be anointed by the oil of the lamp that was lit in front of the icon, Our Lady, the Holy Virgin Mary. Then each one would be healed from their illness and were announcing her miracles.</p>

23,"The old man who steals from two monks, Sadaqā and ʾƎstifānos (or Peṭros) from the monastery of Saint Victor is punished",Africa Egypt probably,"<p>There were two brothers, who were blessed and good in all they did, at the monastery of the great martyr Saint [Mar] Victor within the fortress of Nârqon [there is a monastery dedicated to Victor in Egypt]. The name of the first one, the priest, was Sädäqa. The other one was a deacon by the name Peter [or Stephen in some mss]. They had departed [from the monastery] to settle an affair of the monastery. While they walked, night fell when they were near a town named Ǝlkusəs [Alqosh in Syriac speaking Iraq? Šädäləkäsus in Princeton mss?]. There, was a church that had been constructed in the name of Our Lady, the Holy Two-fold Virgin, Mary, Mother of God. They entered the aforesaid town and they went to the church to sleep there and to be blessed by it. Come the morning, they arose and went on their way. Having arrived at their destination, they found an old man in front of the gates of the monastery of the church[. He was] among the elders of the Muslims who liked robbery and plunder from the possessions of the church in that town.  When the old man saw the monks, he approached them and interacted with them. In their sacks [Arabic word كرز for saddle bag or travelling bag] were the clothes they were going to wear. He stretched his hands towards Priest Sädäqa’s sack. The old man wanted to take the sack from Sädäqa, who did not give it up. When Sädäqa refused to give it to him, the old man struck Sädäqa’s jaw and Sädäqa fell to the ground. [Then,] the old man took the sack and all that was inside of it. When the Priest [likely the deacon?] saw what had happened, he went into the church and stood before the icon of Our Lady, the Holy Two-fold Virgin, Mary, Mother of God, and bowed down before her. He said, “O Mother of God, you know that, if a pilgrim is in a church [lit., house], no one among the people is able to rob him, because he is in the custody of the church. Yet, [when] we came into your church to be blessed by your icon and to take refuge with you, why did all of this evil come upon us from this wicked man?” [Then,] the priest was blessed by Our Lady and he went out to see what had happened [in the meantime]. He found the old man, who had taken his sack, wanting to get away but when he reached the gates, his feet tripped on the threshold of the door. He fell down and his hands were broken and the bones of his arms protruded. As for the sack, it was flung on the ground. The priest took up his possessions in front of the people. He recounted to them what the wicked old man had done to him, that is, what the old man had done to the priest. The old man implored the priest to show mercy on him [even though] he had struck him in the face and took his bag. All the assembled people implored the priest to take pity on the wicked old man. When the wicked old man testified about his sins, the priest said to the people, “I approached the icon of Our Lady, the Holy Two-fold Virgin, Mary, Mother of God and I implored her to help me and I took refuge in her. [Let's see] if she wants to take pity on him or not.” When the people heard this report, they went [into the church] and implored Our Lady to heal the old man. After they had made numerous pleas, they heard a voice coming from the icon. It said, “This old man did violence to a priest who had come to the church in faith. So, there is no cure for him and he won’t become healthy. In three days, he will die and go to Sheol, where there is torment and eternal punishment, because he did something evil against a Christian.” The third day, the old man died a terrible death. When the believers saw what had happened, they joyfully rejoiced in how God had freed them from that old man and how they had found peace. For the old man had been coming throughout the whole year and doing evil things to them. As for the Virgin, she had tolerated him [to see] if he would turn away from his evil actions. But, once he had increased the number of evil things he did, she flung him away and broke him with a terrible death, a death of desolation, at the request of this priest.

24,Atrib miracle: The Christians at Atrib in Egypt who gathered for a feast of Saint Mary are saved from the Arabs.,Africa Egypt probably,"<p>One day among the days, while one was celebrating the festival of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary Mother of God, in the city [ville] of Athribis, the twenty-first of the month of sanê, came the consecration of the holy church in the city of Philippes. </p>
<p>The people of believers would gather during this festival in the church to which we just alluded, because this festival is large and famous.</p>
<p>People [on] would come from all provinces and cities [villes], because Our Lady Mary would appear there.</p>
<p>All the people would see her in the open [ouvertement], veiled with a light that shined brighter than the sun.</p>
<p>At the moment when the priest blessed the Eucharist, the Virgin blessed it as well with her hands.</p>
<p>Because of that, one would go there from all parts with women and children. One would wear beautiful clothing. One would wear all one’s finery in honor of the festival of the Virgin Mary Mother of God, and of the consecration of her church – and to contemplate that consecration [it; la]. </p>
<p>When all the believers arrived from all parts in a finery of silk, gold, and silver, they would see Our Lady. When the Arabs saw her, they went beside their master and told him what they had seen. When the master [he] heard that, he deliberated with them—all the Christians having assembled on the day of their festival, the twenty-first of the month of sanê— to go with them there and to kill them at the point of the sword; one would take all that they had.</p>
<p>When the day of the festival of Our Lady arrived, all assembled according to their custom.</p>
<p>They read the sermon of the year. Next, they began the book of miracles of Mary which had taken place in the days of Haroun-al-Rachid.</p>
<p>And so, the Arabs arrived and surrounded the monastery and church, in order to kill all the people who had assembled there, and to take all that they had.</p>
<p>When they dared to make this arrival [s’avisèrent de la venue], the Arabs brandished their bare swords in their hands, the people were very afraid.</p>
<p>They went in haste, with many tears, before the image of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary Mother of God, so that she would save them from the hand of the evil Arabs.</p>
<p>While they prayed to the Virgin, the Arabs entered the church.</p>
<p>Their leader looked towards the image of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary Mother of God, who was crowned with a great light.</p>
<p>Immediately, he fell to the ground on his face and prostrated himself before her. </p>
<p>He said, “Beautiful are you, of course, and honored by all! Sweet [suave] is your beauty, o queen!”</p>
<p>After that, he turned towards his companions and said to them, “For the love of this queen of the beautiful grace, no one will take action against this church. May no one lay his hands upon these people. He who transgresses my word, I will kill him with the sword.”</p>
<p>When his companions heard that, they turned away, sheathed their swords and went away. When the Christians saw that, they knew that it was Our Lady Mary who had saved them. </p>
<p>She spread her love upon them. They felt a great joy.</p>
<p>From that day, they celebrated the festival with renewed vigor [de plus belle] in honor, glory, and praise, with neither trembling nor fear. They gave back grace to God. They praised Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, who had given them this great grace.</p>
<p>Those who had seen this, brought it back to the country of Ethiopia and narrated it precisely.</p>

<p>One day among the days, there arrived at her house an Ethiopian priest  named Clément, upon whom dwelled [sur lequel demeurait] the grace of God. He entered the house of the woman, who saw the grace of God that was upon him and loved him greatly.</p>
<p>She asked him to stay with her until he should go to Jerusalem to the tomb of Jesus Christ, to Gethsemane to the tomb of His Mother the Virgin and near the holy monks. He told her yes.</p>
<p>She thought within her heart to do for him as the widow of Sarepta  who gave hospitality to the prophet Elijah, had him stay on the terrace of her house, and stayed to serve him with great zeal. </p>
<p>As for this priest named Clément, no man saw his uncovered face, for he covered his face in order to not see the sensory [sensibles] things of the world, according to the rule of monks, as said by the prophet: “Turn my eyes away from worthless things.” </p>
<p>But as soon as a man would arrive near him to be blessed, he [Clément] saw a little of his [a man’s] image. In fact, the people of Egypt who live in Cairo, who have a great faith, love greatly the people of Ethiopia who bear the fatigue of the road, the heat of the sun and the cold of the night, the hunger and thirst for the journey to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>When the priest stayed in the woman’s house, at no hour would he cease  his prayer, as was his custom. He would close the door to the terrace and keep vigil/stay awake [veillait, meaning both] for the whole night.</p>
<p>As for the woman, she would stay close by his dwelling to listen to his prayer.</p>
<p>After the end of the midnight prayer, he would read the book of the miracles of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, Mother of God.</p>
<p>As soon as he would begin to read the miracles of Mary, the woman, mistress of the house, would see [voyait, vision issue] a luminous woman, brighter than the sun, entering by the door of the house’s terrace, there were the monk  was.</p>
<p>When she would enter, the terrace would shine brightly from the intensity of the light that the mistress of the house saw, and it seemed to her that the terrace was burning.</p>
<p>When the woman would see this miracle, she rejoiced very much.</p>
<p>As soon as the monk would finish reading the miracles of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, Mother of the God, the light would disappear.</p>
<p>When the woman saw  this, she loved and served the priest even more, in humility.</p>
<p>But she did not tell this to anyone until the holy Lent [le saint Carême].</p>
<p>At the time of the journey to Jerusalem, when the priest wished to go, she said to him, “Take me with you.” And she prepared travel provisions and all that was necessary for the road so that she might go with him.</p>
<p>When the people of the town learned of this, they grieved because of their love for her and because of the good deeds that she did for each of them. They decided to not let her go and spoke to the head [chef] of the town.</p>
<p>Knowing this, the woman told the people of the town all that she had seen of the Ethiopian when he had read the miracles of Our Lady Mary, Mother of God. She said to them, “I made a promise to God and to His Mother the Virgin that I will not part with this priest until the day of my death. </p>
<p>“And if someone prevents me from going to Jerusalem, Our Lady will denounce him to her beloved Son on Judgement Day.”</p>
<p>When the people heard these words, they rejoiced for the woman and let her go. She journeyed with the monk and arrived at Jerusalem at the tomb of Our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>She received the blessing of Golgotha and of Calvary and also of Gethsemane, the tomb of the Virgin, and of all Holy Places.</p>
<p>She submerged herself in the water of the Jordan.</p>
<p>After this, she died one Sunday, the eighth day after the day of the Holy Resurrection of Our Savior Jesus Christ, and was buried near Mount Zion, the City of God.</p>
<p>Having completed his pilgrimage to Jerusalem, the monk went to the desert of Abbâ Macaire and stayed at the monastery of Elijah for many years.</p>
<p>During his second pilgrimage to Jerusalem, he died there and was buried near Mount Zion in the tomb of the elect woman [la femme élue].</p>
<p>My beloved brothers,  consider how good [belle] is the end of whoever loves charity and mercy, loves Our Lady Mary, Mother of God and reads her miracles, and how such a man is buried in a holy place.</p>
<p>Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, Mother of God, protects in this world those who believe in her and she intercedes for them in the world to come.</p>
<p>They will be with her, for Zion is the true city of the great King who loved it and who sojourned there to save His  creation.</p>
<p>May her intercession  be with us for ever and ever, amen. [Translation as of 05/21/22]</p>

26,The European who wanted to steal the bars of the door to the Manger at Bethlehem.,Levant probably (Any),"<p>A miracle of Our Lady, the Holy Virgin Mary, may her prayer and her blessing be with our king ZY, amen.</p>
<p>It was the feast of Our Lady, the Holy Virgin Mary, on the 16th of Nahasee, the Ascension of her holy body into the heavens. A great feast was being hosted for her at Bethlehem [in Israel,] which is the place where she gave birth to the Savior of the World. And a huge congregation from all the Christians, [those] from Egypt, Ethiopia, Syria, Armenia, Kʷərz, the Maronites, and the Europeans, would gather in that place[, Bethlehem]. </p>
<p>All of them would arrive together at Bethlehem, with their wives and children, where they would perform the Christian baptism for their children. </p>
<p>One of those years, they were hosting the feast we mentioned and being blessed by the holy place where the Virgin Mary knelt down to give birth to the Savior of the World and by the manger where [the baby] Jesus slept and the donkey and cow kept him warm. </p>
<p>The entryway [to the birthplace] was large and beautiful, with two [door] gates. The bars of its gates were nailed with [hinges of] red iron leaves that resembled pure gold. The craftsmanship of the leaves’ engraving was marvelous and interwoven; there was nothing else like it in the world. </p>
<p>While the people were being blessed, and seeing the splendor of the craftsmanship of the gates’ bars, a European man, looked at one of them and marveled at its craftsmanship and Satan placed a love of the bar in his heart and made him long to steal it. He thought to himself, “When all the people leave for home, I will get up at night and grab the bar. Then, I will take it to my country and give it as a gift to one of the kings of Europe and I will get great wealth [for it].” </p>
<p>After the feast was complete, all the people [who were pilgrims] returned to their regions and that European man entered at night while all the people [remaining] were sleeping. He grabbed the bar and placed it upon his head. At once, the bar broke and fell upon his neck, choking him. Due to the great pain he received from this, he cried out with a loud voice. 
When the European monks who were staying in Bethlehem heard that man’s crying out, they left [and came] quickly to learn what had happened. </p>
<p>And having arrived where he was, they saw him being choked by the bar and a lot of blood pouring out. The crushing bar was attempting to cut his neck [off]. So, they asked him what had happened to him. And he told them everything. He begged them, while weeping, to go down into the manager and ask Our Lady Mary to rescue him. </p>
<p>He spoke again to them, [declaring,] “I will become a monk just like you. I will give all my wealth to that church of Bethlehem and will serve that church until the day of my death.” </p>
<p>After the monks heard this account from him, they went down to the entrance into the manger, in which our Lord had slept. [There,] they beseeched Our Lady Mary, with much weeping and burning hearts, to rescue the European man. </p>
<p>When they raised their petition, they heard a voice that said to them, “This man will not be saved from the crushing bar until it is morning. And all Jerusalem’s people and all Bethlehem’s regions will come and see the miracle of my beloved son, that he did in this church, which is the place of his miraculous birth. And after this, that man will be saved.” </p>
<p>Having heard this, the monks sent messengers to the city of Jerusalem and all the regions, [to invite the people] so that they would come and see this miracle and astonishing thing. </p>
<p>When the people heard this, they immediately came from everywhere. They saw the European and the bar crushing his neck and all the blood pouring out of him. </p>
<p>They asked Our Lady in unison to save this man from this terrible pain. And when it became evening [the next day], the break in the bar widened until it fell off his neck. The [broken] bar became whole, just as it had been before, and the seam could not be seen. </p>
<p>The people who had seen this cried out, saying, “O Lord, have mercy on us!” They added, “The praise of your virginity is great, O mother of God. Blessed are we, the poor ones, that we deserve our savior being born in our city and that we have seen your miracle with our own eyes.” </p>
<p>And then they took that European man and brought him down into the manager while the blood was flowing from his neck. They took some of the oil from the lamp that was lit there, and some ground from the manager, and they mixed them together and anointed his neck [with it]. </p>
<p>At that very instant, he was healed from his injury. The blood that was flowing from his neck dried up and the scar of his wound could not be seen. </p>
<p>After they saw this, they marveled and rejoiced due to the man’s rescue and healing. </p>
<p>The next day, he became a monk, gave all his possessions to Bethlehem, remaining there while serving our Lady the Virgin mary and recounting her miracles until the day of his death. </p>
<p>Dear beloved brothers, have you seen the mercy of God, praise be to him? And the compassion of his mother, the Virgin Mary, for the man who stole her possession, the bar of her entryway? And how, after he repented for the thing he did and vowed to be a servant in the church, she quickly healed him from his injury? And how she erased his sins and made him inherit eternal life? May we be worthy of imitating her. </p>
<p>Let us learn, our dear brothers, how to treat well those who treat us evilly, for mercy covers many sins. Just as our Lord says in the holy Gospels, be merciful and they will show mercy to you. And all the more so for one who shows mercy on the day of her blessed feast! </p>
<p>For in the fearful Courtroom she asks her beloved son on that person’s behalf for mercy and salvation.</p>
<p>May her intercession be with our king Zer’a Ya’qob who is called Constantine; may it protect him from the schemes of the enemy; may it deliver him to the port of salvation and life forever and ever. Amen.</p>

Fol. 15a, 1; B. Fol. 19b, 1.] THERE was a certain God-fearing man who loved our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, and his country was Dafra. And he was married to a woman by whom he had three children, two boys and a girl. Now the girl was young and she was called ""Mary."" And the mother of the children died and they mourned for her. And it came to pass on a day, which was the festival of the glorious Nativity, that the two boys wished to go to the church, and they left the little girl [in the house], and they fastened the door upon her so that she might not go out, for it was night. But she wept and cried out, saying, ""Take me with you, and let me participate with you in the offering up of the Offering""; but they refused [to take] her, and they went on their way. Then the little girl went to the picture of our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, and she cried out with tears, saying, ""O my Lady, have compassion upon me and give me consolation."" And straightway our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, who maketh to rejoice and giveth consolation unto those who make supplication unto her, appeared unto the girl, and said unto her, ""What aileth thee, O my daughter?"" And our holy Lady Mary embraced the child, who said unto her,"" They would not let me go to the church to partake of the Offering on the day of the holy festival whereon our Redeemer was born."" And our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, said unto her, ""Be not sad, but come""; and she carried the child to the church, and she partook of the Offering with the folk who were enlightened. Then our Lady Mary said unto her, ""Three days hence I will take thee, and thou shalt be with me""; and three days later the child departed this life, and the Virgin Mary made her like unto herself. And a certain good, and righteous, and God-fearing man saw the child arrayed in purple and following our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, the Mother of Life, Who redeemed us, and he marvelled greatly, and he told the people concerning her.

<p>There was a Christian man living in one of the cities of the region of Giza/Gaza near Egypt. The city was called Mǝneta Diyāqonāt [the monastery of the deacons]. That man truly loved Our Lady Holy Virgin Mary and celebrated her feast every time he delighted the poor, needy and impoverished with food and drink fit for a feast. He brought together his family and neighbors. With abundant love he then prepared for them a great feast. There was a Muslim near him who served him for a wage to fulfil all his material needs. </p>
<p>On each feast of Our Lady Holy Virgin Mary on the third of the month of Tahesas, that is to say her entrance into the temple, the Christian man went inside the sanctuary of the church and having received holy communion, he returned to his house. He then celebrated the feast and gave food and drink without measure to the poor, needy and impoverished for the sake of the name of Our Lady Holy Virgin Mary. He celebrated the feast more grandly than he had celebrated before. </p>
<p>When the day became night, he gathered his relatives and neighbors as he had done before. He gave them a lot of wine to drink. It was very cold that night, and the wind was strong along with a lot of rain. There was a large lantern hanging in the middle of the house. In addition, he would also light in front of them white wax candles having topped them with silver-adorned red brass scissors. </p>
<p>As for the Muslim man whom we have mentioned before who served the Christian man for a wage he would stand before him as he was used to doing. </p>
<p>The assembled sat together with great joy and abundant love, while eating and drinking, praising Our Lady Holy Virgin Mary and recounting her miracle. While they were doing this, the wax burned from a great wind, and the wind melted the wax as it was blowing this way and that. </p>
<p>Someone among the assembled took the scissors to cut the wick to fix the candle. But at that moment the strong mighty wing extinguished the candle. So he got up from his place and brought down the lantern, lighting it so that it would shine. But wax fell from it and extinguished the candle. </p>
<p>After the master of the house saw this, he told the Muslim man who served him to go and light for him a candle. The Muslim man was sad [because of the great storm raging outside] but he could not transgress an order of his employer. </p>
<p>When he received that candle into his hand, he said: “Look now, you all see the strength of the wind and the abundance of the rain, and it is increasing {getting worse} in this night and at this very hour. If I go out and light a candle, the great strength of the wind and the abundance of the rain will extinguish it for me. Then you will be disappointed with me [afterwards]. But if this Virgin has power, the Virgin, whose feast you are celebrating, [for whom] you have gathered the people with worship and praise, so now may power and a miracle be revealed by her with the lighting of this candle that you have handed to me in order to light it.” </p>
<p>And while he was saying this in front of them, the candle that was in his hands, lit at once and also the lantern that was hanging in the house. </p>
<p>When the assembled saw this, they marveled and were amazed and cried out saying: “ Peace to you, o, Virgin Mary, o, Mother of Embodied Light. For you have illuminated the world by the birth of your beloved son and you have saved Adam and his seed from the hand of cursed Satan. You caused the light of your son, which does not go out, to shine over all of us, wicked ones.” </p>
<p>They rejoiced greatly.</p>
<p>That Muslim man told all of the Muslims the miracle of Our Lady Holy Virgin Mary, that is how she lit the candle that was in his hand and also the lantern. When the Muslims heard this from him, they marveled and praised God and his mother, the Virgin.</p>

<p>And this [miracle] also happened in this city which is called Meneta Diyaqon [the Monastery of the Deacon]. </p> 
<p>A Christian man whose name was Joseph had a very beautiful wife. She had many possessions, including ornamented linen clothing, gold, and much silver. She loved Our Lady, the Holy Virgin Mary, and celebrated her feast with joy and gladness, serving the people who came. </p>
<p>She had given birth to three daughters but not a son. Because of this she grieved. She went to the Church of Our Lady, the Holy Virgin Mary, and asked her to give her a son, who would make her heart glad and would perform her remembrance and would inherit her wealth. </p>
<p>Instantly, she conceived. [Later,] she gave birth to a son, who was astonishingly handsome. </p>
<p>She brought him to the Church of Our Lady, the Holy Virgin Mary so that the priests might give him a Christian baptism. </p>
<p> [Before she conceived,] she gave many alms to the poor and needy for the sake of the name of Our Lady, the Holy Virgin Mary, as she had vowed previously, until Our Lady Mary had granted her a handsome son. </p>
<p>Anyone who saw him was astonished by his handsomeness. In addition, his mother joyfully rejoiced in him. </p>
<p>After some time, a plague entered the land of Egypt and many people and children died, as well as male and female servants. At that time, the son was seven years old. </p>
<p>In that year, the three daughters of that woman died. But she did not grieve for them on account of [having] her son. </p><p>After this, the son became sick and drew near to death. On seeing her son [sick], his mother grieved. But, she held fast to her faith in Our Lady, the Holy Virgin Mary, and the spring that her beloved son brought forth in the famous place that is called Matarya. </p>
<p>Then, she came [to the Church of Our Lady Mary] saying, “My dear Virgin Lady, may God be a witness to my need/impoverishment. I have suffered a loss/I am a sinner/I am suffering a loss. If you ask your beloved son to heal my son from his illness, I will go to the spring of Matarya, that your son brought forth. I will take a measure of earth[?] and a measure of rosewater, musk, and sweet perfumes, and I will mix it all together and pour it into the spring that your son has brought forth. Also, I will prepare a great feast for the poor and the needy, for the sake of your holy name. I will give alms to them in accordance with my wealth on the days of your remembrance, the 21st of every month, until I pass away.” </p>
<p>When she had vowed this with firm faith and no doubt, and with belief in Our Lady, the Holy Virgin Mary, then Our Lady, the Holy Virgin Mary saw the strength of her faith and she asked her beloved son to heal that woman’s son from his illness. </p>
<p>After three days, he was healed and his mother joyfully rejoiced. </p>
<p>She described to her husband what she had vowed in her heart and he rejoiced. Then they called their loved ones and neighbors, and prepared with them everything that was needed for the feast, as she had vowed. </p>
<p>She brought a metalsmith and had him make a crown of pure gold for the son, who had been healed from his illness. </p>
<p>She went with her son and her husband Joseph to that spring that Our Lord Jesus Christ, praise be to him, brought forth as a memorial for his having come there with his Virgin Mother. </p>
<p>When they arrived at that place, the spring’s servants rejoiced. They came again to the holy place of Our Lord, and they gave them a place to sleep on the upper floor of the elevated house covering the spring. Then they celebrated a great feast for the poor. She gave many alms in the name of Our Lady, the Holy Virgin Mary. They fed the poor and the needy and destitute until they were full. </p>
<p>The family gathered together in one place, on the deck [of the upper floor of the elevated house covering the spring], and they spent the night in it. They began to eat, drink, be merry, and praise our Lady the Holy Virgin Mary, the one who gifted them with the healing of their son. </p>
<p>While they were drinking, the wife looked at that holy spring through the window. She signaled to a servant of the place to remove the [feasting] people so that she might fulfill her vow and baptize her son using the qäwadis, which is a pipe used to pour the drawn spring water into the reservoir, according to the custom of the Egyptians. </p>
<p>After the servant heard this from the woman, he agreed, joyfully rejoicing due to the great thing she had done for him. He fastened/pitched a curtain/veil/canopy on top of the spring for her. </p>
<p>Then she clasped her son to her bosom and put him into that [curtained] place. She took the saffron, rosewater, the fragrant oil, and the musk, and then mixed them together in the silver basin adorned with gold. She took off her son’s clothes and placed him into the circle, which is the reservoir under the pipe. </p>
<p>She took the silver basin to pour the oil into the holy spring. However, the basin slipped from her hand. Although she attempted to catch it, her hand caught against her son and he, following the basin, fell into the spring. </p>
<p>When she saw what had happened, she screamed out loudly, sobbing, saying, “My dear lady virgin, I have entrusted my son to you!” </p>
<p>When all the people heard the woman’s cry, they came to see what had happened. </p> 
<p>That woman told them everything: how the silver basin fell into the spring and how her son fell after it. </p>
<p>From among the number of people who came to see was a man named Rəzqəla, which means God Is Generous. He was behind it. </p>
<p>Having heard the report of the woman, he quickly climbed down a ṭums, which is a rope, to the spring. </p>
<p>And having gone down there, he found the child sitting upon the surface of the water and playing with the silver basin, which was in his hand. Also, the saffron, oil, musk, and rosewater remained in the basin and it did not mix with the [spring] water. </p>
<p>Ləzəqla called out loudly, “Peace to the Mother of Life who gave life to this child, before and now.” </p>
<p>Our Lady Mary revealed this miracle [she had performed]. </p>
<p>Then Rəzqəla said to the mother of the child, “Don’t weep, rejoice in God and in his mother the Virgin, because your son lives.” </p>
<p>When the gathered people heard this, they joyfully rejoiced, they called out saying, “O Lord, have mercy on us. Peace be to you, Mother of Mercy, who gives compassion and rescue.” </p>
<p>And then, Rəzqəla clasped the child and the basin to his chest, and climbed up out of the spring to the crowd by the rope. </p>
<p>And when all the people saw the child alive, and the basin in his hand, with the saffron, oil, and rosewater, had not spilled, they marveled and were amazed. </p>
<p>The child said to them, “When I fell into the spring, I saw beautiful woman who caught me and the basin in her hand and placed me on the surface of the water, until Räzqəla climbed down and brought me up to all of you.” </p>

30,The poor man from Aragon [Spain] who was buried alive in a gold mine.,Europe confirmed (Spain),"LXXVIII THE VIRGIN MARY AND THE MAN WHO WAS BURIED IN A MINE [Brit. Mus. MS. Orient. No. 652. Fol. 143b, No. 130.] NOW there is in the country of Afrurgi, in a certain district, a high mountain in the belly of which there is much gold, and the men of the district used to come and dig therein, and they obtained much gold. And there was in the city a certain poor man who possessed nothing, and he was in very sore need of the things of this world. Now, as I have already said, the men of the city used to come to that mountain and dig out gold, and when they had returned to their houses, that poor man used to go to the mountain, and enter the mine, and collect the fragments, and find a little gold, which he would take to his house and with which he would buy food and raiment for himself. He had no other money, and by these means he subsisted. And he loved our Lady Mary, and he frequented her church, and bowed before her picture, and gave gifts to her continually. And he gave gifts daily to the church, one loaf of bread, one vessel of wine, one wax candle, and two dirhams of incense; these things he gave because of his love for our Lady Mary, saying, ""I come to thy house, the place where I would come, and I give offerings according to my ability."" And this he continued to do many days. And his wife was a beautiful woman and a fearer of God, and like her husband she believed in our Lady Mary with all her heart, and they were united in love and faith. And one day he went out, according to his wont, to the mountain wherefrom they dug out gold, and after the men of the city had de parted, he went into the mine to look for gold. And as he was in the mine the gallery wherein all the men of the city dug collapsed over him, and the entrance to it was buried in earth and stones. But by the Will of God two slabs of stone came and stood up, one on his right hand and the other on his left, like two pillars, and they supported the roof above that man. And he was as it were in a tent, and he suffered no injury whatsoever from all the earth and stones, for our Lady Mary protected him, and no harm reached him. And the men of the city came out and arrived at the shaft wherein the man was to carry off gold, according to their wont, and they found the entrance to the gallery blocked up with earth and stones, and they knew at once that the man was buried inside. And they wept exceedingly, and there was great lamentation in that city, and they said, ""Behold, the poor man is dead and is buried in the gallery of the mine."" And when his wife knew this she cried out and moaned from the depths of her heart, saying, ""Behold, my lord is dead and is buried in the earth of the mountains. Woe is me! Woe is me! Who will give me my lord's body to bury like the bodies of all other men?"" And then she petitioned our Lady Mary, saying, ""O thou boast of all the world, Queen of women, Mother of the Redeemer, behold, my lord is buried deep in the mine, and I have not got his body to bury in thy church. But I trust in thy prayer to preserve him by thy intercession. And behold, I will continue to give to thy church the offering that my lord used to bring there daily."" And that day she brought one loaf, one vessel of wine, one wax candle, and two dirhams of incense, and she continued to do this for twelve days, saying, ""It shall be for a memorial of my lord, so that he may find rest and peace with the souls of all the saints."" And after twelve days the men of the city went and came to the mine, and they said, ""Come, let us dig out this earth until we come to the body of him that is dead."" And as they were digging they heard a sound as of a man talking to a friend, and they said among themselves, ""Satans dwell in a place where there is gold in order to guard it; now they are lovers of money."" And in digging they came to the middle of the gallery, where they found the poor man who was entombed therein. And they said unto him, ""Art thou alive? Art thou not dead [being buried] so long? How hast thou continued to exist in the belly of the earth all the past twelve days?"" And the man answered and said unto them, ""When this gallery fell in these two pillars came and stood upright on my right hand and on my left, and supported the [roof of] this gallery above me; but I know not whence they came and who brought them here. And I have remained here until this present in safety, and comfort, and rest, and no harm of any kind hath befallen me; on the contrary, I seem to have been in a beautiful house."" And the people asked him and said unto him, ""How didst thou live, and what didst thou eat during this period?"" And the man answered and said unto them, ""The offering that I used to bring to the church, that is to say, one loaf of bread, one vessel of wine, one wax candle, and two dirhams of in cense, all these things, I say, did our Lady Mary bring unto me. And she said unto me, This loaf of bread shall serve as thy food, and this vessel of wine shall be for the joy of thy heart, and this wax candle shall burn before thee by day and by night so that the darkness may not overwhelm thee, and this incense shall serve thee for sweet perfume."" And when the people heard these words they marvelled greatly at them. Now whilst the man was buried in the mine his wife brought those gifts to the church and set them down at the gates thereof, and the gatekeeper used to bring them in whilst the priests were watching him, and when they went out the gifts had disappeared and could not be found. And then they called the gatekeeper and said unto him, ""Where are the offerings which the wife of the dead man hath brought? Where hast thou put them?"" And the gatekeeper answered and said unto them, ""I saw the woman bring them here, and when I turned round I could not find them."" And then the priests rebuked the gatekeeper and said unto him, ""Didst thou not make them disappear and carry them to thy house?"" And they thrust him out and drove him from the church. And when the man who was in the mine told the people that it was our Lady Mary who had brought to him the offerings they marvelled, and they glorified God and praised our Lady Mary, the worker of wonders and miracles. And the man whom she had saved from death forsook this world, and became a monk, and his wife became a nun, and they both continued to serve and worship our Lady Mary with a pure heart and a good mind; and they celebrated her festivals until they died and departed from this world; and they inherited the kingdom of heaven through the prayer of our Lady Mary, who is full of compassion and mercy, and is the mother of gladness.

31,The cupbearer of the king of France.,Europe probably (France),"<p>This is said concerning two young people whom a king had distinguished to be guardians in the interior of the royal palace. The king had chosen them among many soldiers whom he brought and made return from a campaign against his enemies. The king loved them. He made one a guardian of the goods of his treasure, he made the other responsible for the service of his orders. When the king drank wine, the second presented the wine to him in a cup of pure gold, in which the king drank.</p>
<p>Although the two young people were in such a situation, the guardian of the king’s treasure felt a great jealousy towards his companion. He mulled over a grave scheme, pernicious to the point of (leading) to death. When he considered and saw the honors and graces which had been given to his companion by the king because he conferred the word of the king to the people, and returned also the word of the people to the king, and served wine to the king to drink, this guardian of the home of the king (thus) called upon his companion. </p>
<p>He said to him, “Come, so I can tell you what the king says about you, but you, do not tell anyone else. Indeed, I tell you that [voici que] we had both been made prisoners in the same town. Is not our sadness one, and one, too, our joy? [Notre tristesse à tous deux n’est-elle pas une, et une notre joie à tous deux ?] In truth I tell you, I heard the king say, ‘When he serves me drink and speaks to me, my intestines turn over and rise because of the putrid odors of his fetid mouth. For this reason, I want to kill him.’</p>
<p>“I heard him speak in this way (even though I was) in an alcove [recoin] (?). Perhaps, even though you serve him drink and talk to him – him also talking to you --, you should speak to him having hidden your mouth with your hand and standing farther away [t’étant éloigné].”</p>
<p>He said this deceptively because of his jealousy.</p>
<p>The other said to him in ignorance of his maliciousness, “My brother, you spoke truthfully, without lie. In going (near the king ?), I will stay firstly [resterai d’abord] to say these beautiful words: ‘perhaps I will know and learn.’”</p>
<p>While he was saying this, the king called him and gave him a message.</p>
<p>When the deceiver saw that the king had dismissed his companion, having given him a message, the deceiver returned to quickly slander his companion beside the king. </p>
<p>The deceiver said to the king: “Listen, my lord, this which was said of you by this companion of mine whom you love: ‘What to do about the stench of his mouth? At the moment when he gives me a message, at the moment when he speaks to me and also when I serve him drink, that is why my intestines roll over.’</p>
<p>“Here, so that you believe me, my lord : see him speak to you having placed his hand over his mouth ; may that be a sign for you.”</p>
<p>At the moment when he was leaving having said that, his companion the envoy entered. </p>
<p>The king said to him, “Have you returned?” </p>
<p>The envoy said, “Yes.”</p>
<p>The king said to him, “Come, I pray you, tell me.” </p>
<p>The envoy spoke to him from afar, having placed his hand over his mouth and turned his neck.</p>
<p>When the king saw him do this, he recalled the words of the slanderer and said, “Call to me the lighter of the furnace.”  </p>
<p>He was called. [On l’appela.]</p>
<p>When the king saw the lighter, the king said to him, Go quickly and swiftly light the furnace. He whom I will send you by (making him) say, ‘That which I told you to do, have you done it?’, having received him, throw him into the stomach of the furnace.”</p>
<p>Having heard, the lighter went away to execute the command of the king.</p>
<p>Having waited a little, the king sent the messenger by saying, “ Say to the lighter : “That which I told you to do, have you done it?’”</p>
<p>Having acquiesced, the envoy saw on his way [en allant] a church which had been constructed in the name of Our Lady Mary. He entered to greet Our Lady.</p>
<p>Next he saw an icon of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary Mother of God. He approached her, kissed her and said to her, “Greetings to you, O redeemer of all the universe.”</p>
<p>Having said this, because of the grandeur of his love for Our Lady, he fell asleep there. </p>
<p>After that, the king sent to the lighter of the furnace the slanderer by saying to this one here, “Say to him: ‘Have you done that which I told you to do?’”</p>
<p>This messenger, having left the palace of his lord, spoke to the lighter of the furnace and made him know all that the king had tasked him with.</p>
<p>Having heard, the lighter of the furnace threw him then into the center of the fire. As soon as the body of the slanderer burned, his bones as well; he became ash.</p>
<p>As for he who was asleep before the icon of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary Mother of God, he woke from his slumber.</p>
<p>When he thought of that which the king had commanded him to do, then he was frightened and agitated.</p>
<p>Then he ran, arrived, spoke to the lighter of the furnace and said to him : “Have you done that which the king told you to do?”</p>
<p>The man said, “Yes, I did it.”</p>
<p>Having heard this, the envoy brought him back to the king. </p>
<p>The king said to the envoy, “Who are you?”</p>
<p>The envoy said, “I am he who you sent.”</p>
<p>The king responded to him by saying, “Where were you staying until now?”</p>
<p>The envoy responded by saying, “As I was going there where you sent me, I saw a church and I wanted to enter there to greet Our Lady.When I had greeted Our Lady, I perceived [aperçus] an icon of Our Lady Mary and, because I saw her, I slept a little. Then, having woken, I was frightened and went beside the lighter of the furnace; having said to him that which you had asked me to, I came beside you.”</p>
<p>Having heard this, the king sent a herald in all the territories to assemble his soldiers, his officers, and his governors. </p>
<p>And so, all assembled. The king interrogated the envoy and said to him, “My friend and envoy, tell me, I pray you, that which your companion told you.” </p>
<p>The envoy said: “No.”</p>
<p>The king interrogated him a second and a third time.</p>
<p>After this, the envoy told him that which his companion had said to him, “I heard him say, ‘The king said of you ; His mouth gives me a putrid odor when he speaks with me and also at the moment when he serves me drink: my intestines turn over and I want to kill him.’ He only said this to me, nothing else.”</p>
<p>The king said before his soldiers: “All of you, listen to that which a guardian of my palace and my goods did against his own companion by the slander of saying, ‘The king said of you, ‘Your mouth gives me a putrid odor, speak to me from afar, having placed your hand over your mouth, so that I do not kill you.’’</p>
<p>“And to me he said, ‘O king, this companion of mine spoke of you and insulted you by saying, ‘He gives me a putrid odor like that of excrement.’’</p>
<p>“Having heard this, I command that someone bring to me the lighter of the furnace,” and he was brought. Next, having waited a little, I dispatched my envoy. While this one here was going, he saw a church and entered there. He perceived an icon of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary Mother of God, and the mercy of God and the good will of his mother the Virgin put him to sleep. Having waited patiently a little, I dispatched to the lighter of the furnace that slanderer, guardian of the goods of the palace, and he was thrown into the stomach of the furnace and, soon, at the same moment, he became ash. As the prophet said : His misdeed returns upon his head, his violence descends upon his skull. “ </p>
<p>Seeing thus that the word of the prophet had fulfilled itself upon that jealous slanderer, the priests, the managers of the church, the officers and the governors were delighted with their king.</p>
<p>The king, with his soldiers and his officers, threw a party in joy and a great jubilation.</p>
<p>He made written the miracle of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary Mother of God. [Translation as of 05/21/22]</p>

One man guarded the king’s treasures, and the other served as the king’s envoy. Although both men held important positions, the guardian grew jealous of the envoy. He told his companion to cover his mouth when speaking to the king, since the king found his breath revolting. Likewise, the guardian told the king that the envoy had complained that the king had bad breath. The next time the king spoke with the envoy he saw the man cover his mouth, and he grew furious. The king sent a servant to light the furnace, and told him to throw into the fire the first man who came and asked a specific question: “Have you done that which I told you to do?” The king then sent the envoy to ask the servant this question. On the way, the envoy stopped at a church to pray to an icon of the Virgin Mary, and there he fell asleep. Meanwhile, the king sent the guardian to ask the servant whether he had completed his task.

32,"A pious wife and a bankrupt husband who denied Christ when he became poor meet Satan, a black dog, who helps them find gold",Africa Egypt probably,"(summary by Dorothea Reule) (BOr (BL) 652, f. 120v) After a married couple, who used to keep the feasts of St Mary, become poor, the husband denies Christ and Mary and affirms Satan. Satan asks him to bring his wife, so that they will be given gold and silver. After the man states that his wife will not come without seeing gold first, Satan tells him that a black dog will lead him to the gold and silver. The man finds the gold and brings it to his wife, telling her that it was given to him by a friend. As she remains dubious about the gold's rightful origin, he promises to take her to his friend. On the way, the wife wants to stop at a church, which the husband refuses to enter. She enters alone and prays before the icon of St Mary, under which she falls asleep. St Mary then appears to the husband under the aspect of his wife. He brings her to Satan who recognizes her and flees. After she reprimands him, he reaffirms his belief in her and is sent back to fetch his wife from the church.

33,The French artist who fell from the scaffolding while painting frescoes.,Europe confirmed (France),"VIII THE VIRGIN MARY AND THE PAINTER WHOSE SCAFFOLD WAS OVERTHROWN BY THE DEVIL [A. Fol. 17a, 1 j B. Fol. 21a, 1.] NOW there was in days of old a certain man who was a painter, and there was no one who could be compared with him for skill in painting; and he loved our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, with his whole heart. And whensoever he painted a picture of her he did so with exceedingly great care, and he employed his greatest skill in the performance of the work. And it came to pass that he painted a likeness of our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary the God-bearer, on a stone wall in a certain church in the country of France; and the picture was a most wonderful and marvellous piece of work, and every one who saw it was astonished at the beauty of her form, and was led to believe that she was speaking unto him. And he painted by the side of the likeness of our holy Lady, the twofold Virgin, Mary, another picture in which he showed how [the blessed] dwelt in Paradise. And he painted yet another picture of hell representing the Devil who had been cast therein, and his wicked fiends. And Satan saw him, and was filled with rage against him, and he overturned and threw down the scaffolding on which the painter was working, and hurled both the painter and the scaf folding to the ground; now the French church was a very lofty one, and the painter cried out, ""O my Lady Mary, help me and save me from destruction."" And straightway a band of light came forth from the picture of the Virgin, and she stretched forth her arm and laid hold of the man, and he was caught in mid-air by her hand from out of the picture, and he remained sus pended at a height of ten cubits from the ground ; and he remained suspended by the hand out of the picture for the space of one hour, and he was uttering cries for help. And when the people heard his outcries they came to him and saw what a wonderful thing had been wrought by our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary: then, little by little, she let the painter come down, and she handed him over to the men that they might pass him down to the ground from one to the other. And the people who saw this wonderful thing gave glory unto God Almighty, and praised our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, the God-bearer, and they said, ""Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb""; and they celebrated a great festival for seven days. And they called that picture, ""The picture that delivered him and raised him up out of the dust""; and the hand of the Virgin hath remained stretched out from the picture, just as it was when it laid hold on the painter, even unto this day, so that it may be a memorial of the event unto him that shall come after. The painter and his wooden scaffolding were hurled to the ground: As thou didst help him of old and didst straightway deliver him When he made entreaty, and [didst give him] glad ness in the place of weeping, Deliver thou me, O my Lady, O thou who art ornamented with splendour, And let the Proud One (i.e. the Devil) yearn in vain for my destruction.

34,The devout Muslim who became a Christian when Saint Mary appeared to him.,Africa confirmed,"<p>A miracle of Our Lady Mary. May her prayer be with our king, Zar’a Ya’qob, for ever and ever, amen. </p>
<p>Christians lived in a certain region. In it, a church [built] in the name of Our Lady Mary was a one-hour journey away. Right next door to the Christians was a Muslim place of worship. In that mosque, a Muslim prayed the evening, morning, and midnight prayers. </p>
<p>Whenever he finished his prayers, he would [come out and] speak with the Christians. He would say to them, “Don't you know about Mary’s greatness? Because we know that she gave birth to the Word without the seed of man. Why aren’t you coming to the church when it is time to pray? What is this life of yours that you are saying ‘we are Christians’?” </p>
<p>During the time when the Muslim was saying these things to them, those Christians went to the ruler of the region [for a certain matter]. However, their judge became angry with them. </p>
<p>So, one of those Christians left and became a Muslim. After a long time, he returned to that region. </p>
<p>He happened upon that Muslim [who had rebuked them], who said to him, “Come, so that I may teach you fasting, prayer, and ritual cleansing.” </p>
<p>But when that Christian[, the convert,] entered the [Muslim] place of worship to devote himself to prayer, he began to weep and wail. He asked Our Lady Mary to have mercy upon him, to forgive his sin, and to save him from this ordeal [of having converted]. </p>
<p>So, our Compassionate Lady Mary showed mercy to the convert who had asked her. </p> 
<p>But, she revealed herself to that Muslim [who had rebuked them] that night. She said to him, “Why are you troubling the Christians? I am going to condemn and kill you with a terrible death.” </p>
<p>He was afraid and terrified, saying, “Who are you, my Lady?” </p>
<p>She replied, “I am Mary, the mother of the Word, who took on flesh from me.” She added, “You are faithful to me with your words, but your heart is distant from me.” </p>
<p>Having heard this, he was terrified. He leapt [out of bed] and prostrated himself to her, saying, “I believe in you, my dear Lady Mary, with all my heart and all my mind and that you are the mother of the Lord, the Living Word of the Father. As for me, from now on I will live as a Christian and die under the Christian law.” </p>
<p>So, she blessed him with her holy hand and made the sign of the cross of Christ over his face. </p>
<p>She then said to him, “After you get up in the morning, publicly proclaim the Christian law. And, if you die for the sake of Christ, you will be with me in the kingdom of heaven.” Then, she gave him peace and bid him farewell. </p>
<p>When he got up in the morning, he shouted out, saying, “I believe that My Lady Mary is the Mother of God and that Jesus Christ is the savior of the world.” </p>
<p>When his fellow Muslims heard this, they seized him, condemned him, and killed him. [Throughout,] he was shouting, saying, “I believe in My Lady Mary.” </p>
<p>Thus, he finished. </p>
<p>Our Lady Mary welcomed him into the kingdom of heaven. </p>
<p>May her prayers and blessings be upon our king Zar’a Ya’qob. Amen</p>

<p>Oh beloved brothers, incline your ears and prepare your minds so that we might tell you this marvelous account, which cannot enter the mind of the dead, nor that of the angels. </p>
<p>It is a [divine] knowledge that is different from intelligence and which the tongue cannot interpret. </p>
<p>It is the mystery of the incarnation of the Son of God, who came to be for the sake of saving Adam and his children. </p>
<p>The Holy Spirit conceived the hidden fire of divinity within the human flesh, which Christ took from Our Lady Mary, the Holy Pure Virgin, without the seed of man. </p>
<p>Just as the Angel Gabriel announced [to Mary], “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, the power of the almighty will cover you, and therefore the one who is born from you will be holy and called the Son of God.”</p>
<p>And then our Lord was born in Bethlehem, in the city of David, just as it says in the Gospel. [start at f. 124r, col. 2, 2 lines from bottom]</p>
<p>An angel appeared to Joseph in a dream and said to him: “Take the child and his mother and go to the land of Egypt, because wicked Herod wants to kill him.”</p>
<p>At once Joseph took the child and his mother, just as the angel had told him. When they arrived in the land of Egypt, they spent the night in an abandoned place. They remained there five days. </p>
<p>After this, Our Lord, praise be to Him, with His holy mouth said to His mother the Virgin Mary: “In this place a holy church in your name and in mine will be constructed, which will be a monastery. Miracles will be revealed in it, and great wonders will be made known to all peoples, each in their own language. All the believers will see them. Moreover, the Muslims will also remember my coming into the world and my incarnation from you for the salvation of Adam and his children.”</p>
<p>[He continued:] “From the 21st until the 25th of this month you will appear in this monastery which was built in your name in this place. I will command the pure archangels Michael and Gabriel to be on your right and left so as to praise my dwelling with you and to glorify my incarnation from you. I will make witnesses of all who testify my name, bear my Passion in their flesh and follow after my bonds, which I am willing to accept by my will from the wicked Jews for the sake of the salvation of humanity when the proper time has come.” </p>
<p>[He continued:] “They will come to this holy place and dwell with you, bowing down to your glory. All people will look at each other as a brother looks at his brother, a son looks at his son, a friend looks at his friend, a loved one looks at his loved one, so that all people understand that you are the most exalted among the heavenly beings. You will be honored more than the earthly beings. If someone faithfully asks you for one of the martyrs or the saints or other believers who have died in the orthodox faith the one who is asked for will come to you and the person who asks you will see him . He will rejoice in the appearance of the one he asked for and in the appearance of all whom he has seen. This miracle will be revealed until the end of the world.”</p>
<p>And then the holy church was built in the name of his mother, the Virgin, in this place that we mentioned previously, just as he promised her with his holy and righteous mouth which is without falsehood.</p>
<p>The monks gathered at the church and it became a great monastery. And it was called Dabra Metmaq and known by everyone and they came to it from all the cities and regions and those from the peoples of Egypt and Ethiopia and Syria and Armenia and Alexandria and Maron  and Qwars  and France  and Rome  and Nesatra  and Persia  and Greece and from east to west, would [come and] arrive on the eve of the feast when it was the 20th  of the month of Genbot until the 25th, each and every year. [WLB: annually] </p>
<p>All of them arrived at this monastery and they saw these signs and wonders that appeared in the dome of the vault of this church. And they would describe what they saw to their people [when they went home].</p>
<p>In the first year, upon the completion of the construction and sanctification in the name of Our Lady, Holy Virgin Mary, when it was the 21st of the month of Genbot, and those monks were returning after completing the morning prayer, they wanted to go administer the bread of the Eucharist, and a great and amazing light came upon them unexpectedly. They thought [WLB: feared, believed] that the monastery was burning due to the brightness of the light that had appeared. </p>
<p>After a little while, that light turned into the likeness of a small ark,  in the vault of the church, in the midst of its rays, and when they saw this, they were terrified and astonished while filled with admiration. </p>
<p>And, behold, they saw our lady, the pure and holy Virgin Mary, with Michael on her right and Gabriel on her left. And Michael and Gabriel placed her in that Ark of Light. And the monks were terrified and they didn’t recognize the pure Virgin or the angels who were with her.</p>
<p>Rather it seemed to them that they were phantasms [or specters]. And while they were marveling, a voice called out to them from the top of the ark, “Do not be afraid! I am Mary, the Mother of Jesus Christ,  and those who are at my right and left hand are Michael and Gabriel. I have come to this place by the command of my beloved Son so that I might complete what he promised me with his holy mouth. Behold, you will all see the marvel and you will rejoice without ceasing. Hurry now, and go to the cities that are close to you and tell them about what you have seen with your eyes and what you have heard with your ears. Call out to them, ‘Come and see the miracle of my beloved son, the one he has promised me, and that has taken place in this church. That way, my beloved son will be praised with his father and the holy spirit.”</p>
<p>When the monks heard this from Our Lady, the Holy Virgin Mary, they hurried to go to the cities that were close to them and those far away. They told the Christians. At once, the men, women and children went together and arrived at the holy monastery. When they entered the church, they saw Our Lady, the Virgin Mary, sitting upon the Ark of Light and also the angels were standing at her right and left. </p>
<p>And also the 24 Priests of Heaven came with their censers and the incense smoke, which had a pleasing aroma, came [WLB: floated] out from the incense and it appeared and filled that temple. And they gave her incense,  one by one, and they bowed their heads before her and she blessed them. </p>
<p>And they also saw, surrounding the Ark of Light, the children whom Herod killed playing in front of her, some riding upon the shoulders of others, and they were leaping and hugging each other. </p>
<p>Then the twelve apostles and the seventy-two disciples came and they bowed before her and blessed them.</p>
<p>When they saw this, from an abundance of joy, their souls desired to be separated from their flesh [and go to heaven].</p>
<p>At once they cried out together, saying, “Peace be to you, dear Virgin, full of grace, God is with you. Blessed are you and blessed is the fruit of your womb. We honor you, with Elizabeth, your family member. How are we deserving of this grace, that you come to us, the mother of our lord? For we are wicked and poor.” [WLB: why poor?]</p>
<p>The bishop, the possessor of the seat of that city,  arrived there, and he cried out with a loud voice, saying “Blessed are you, over me, my dear lady and the mother of my lord, Jesus Christ.” And he prostrated himself in front of her and he looked up at her. The bishop and all the people saw the Father standing at her right hand, while she blessed the bishop and the people three times with the sign of the cross. The bishop and all the people praised her, as they had been doing before.</p>
<p>And each one of them who had faith and love for the martyrs, the saints, and the holy ones, and each who had performed their remembrance would asked Our Lady, the Virgin, to reveal to them the one they had performed remembrance for. He would come to her at that time and prostrate before the Ark of Light, in which was the Holy Virgin. She would bless him and he would turn around and go, and whenever the arrival of another martyr surprised the one who was going, they would hug and embrace one another. Those who came first from among the martyrs were [the Saints] George, Theodore, Mercurius, and Claudius, and second came the other martyrs. </p>
<p>And any one of the people who said, “My Dear Lady Virgin, bring me so-and-so,” immediately, she would bring the one they asked for. Suppose that the asked for one was one of the martyrs. Then, George came first, riding on a white horse, and all the people would see him prostrating himself in front of her, having descended from his horse and she would bless him with her hands and having been blessed he would turn around and go a little ways [from her] and then he would mount his horse and he would leave. Everyone saw him. </p>
<p>And likewise all of the martyrs and saints whom one of the people wanted to see, he was brought, looking as he had during his life. </p>
><p>The horse which he was riding, if it was white or red or black, was in the appearance that it had before, for the appearance of both the martyrs and their horses is known. For example, the horse of Saint George in the icons is white, and that of Theodore is red, and that of Mercurius is black. In another example, the monks of Aba Anthony have a known appearance and clothing. The appearance of Aba Macarius, Aba Shenoute, and other saints all the way to the patriarchs Aba Abraham, Aba Mark, Aba Matthew, and those like them is also known.</p>
<p>If the people asked Our Lady, the Holy Virgin Mary, she would bring the one asked for and he would be blessed by her. All of the people will see him in the appearance by which they knew him. </p>
<p>When a bishop passed away, the people of his bishopric would arrive at this monastery and request Our Lady Mary that they might see him, and she would bring him to them. They would see him clearly while Mary was blessing him, and they would rejoice with him. </p>
<p>If some Christians died and [some] had been spared, then a brother would ask her to show him his brother who had died. Likewise a father would ask for his son or a daughter for her mother. At that moment Our Lady Mary would bring them into this archway of the vault, prostrating down to her, and she would bless them. </p>
<p>And after they saw them, the living would rejoice with their families. All of them would praise Our Lady the Virgin Mary. They would amplify her glory each with their own tongue that God had given them.</p>
<p>Because of the joy that came upon them at that hour when they saw the Mother of the Savior of the World and asked her for the forgiveness of their sins, they were as if in heaven.</p>
<p>From their abounding joy in the appearance of her face, each man, one by one, would ask her: “Appear to me, my dear Lady, in a garment that is different from the one which you are wearing now”.</p>
<p>Then she changed her garments and appeared to them. There were times when she appeared to them in clothes that were the color of fire. Other times she appeared to them in a green garment. Other times she appeared to them in a garment that was the color of the sky. She appeared to those who asked her in clothes of many different colors. She did not disregard their request.</p>
<p>Each time she changed her garments, a garment of light would stretch out in front of her and she would conceal herself from the people. After a little while that garment of light would be removed from in front of her. She would then reveal herself to the people in a color of garment that they had asked her for. They were delighted by this.</p>
<p>They were delighted when they saw with their own eyes each one of their relatives in the image and in the likeness  that they had during their life.</p>
<p>Foreigners, Muslims, and others also came. Every year they arrived at the holy monastery on the 20th of the month of Genbot, and they stayed there until the 25th of that month. [They came] because on these five days that we have mentioned previously the appearance of Our Lady Virgin Mary does not cease in this sanctuary. </p>
<p>On each one of these days they saw angels stretching out their wings over the sanctuary and over the gathered people. The number of people was increasing day by day until the five days were over. The monastery could not fit them all.</p>
<p>Instead, they pitched their tents next to the monastery. The area of their camp stretched until the monastery was hidden from the eyes of the multitudes who came there.</p>
<p>At that time Our Lady Mary would appear. Whenever the people saw her, they would lower their liturgical headgear, their monks’ caps, and their headscarves from the tops of their heads. They would throw them to Our Lady the Virgin Mary and she would catch with her hand whichever ones she wanted for about one hour or even longer, and then she would throw them back down.</p>
<p>How great was the rejoicing and gladness which came to pass in that hour when she would throw the headscarf, the liturgical headgear or the monks’ caps! </p>
<p>The people were pressed in close together and were trampling one another. Whoever overpowered the other ones would seize that blessed relic which she had grasped with her pure hand. </p><p>One year, during the feast a maidservant from the multitude who had gathered came. She threw her headscarf upwards and Our Lady the Virgin caught it in her hand. Having seen this, the crowd was amazed. </p>
<p>There was one among them who was skeptical. He said: “The headscarf was hung up and was caught on an iron nail which was in the vault of the church.”</p>
<p>The Lady Virgin Mary, knowing the doubts of their hearts, stretched out the headscarf with her hands and she waved it while the crowd saw this. Then she threw it back down. </p>
<p>As for that maidservant, as she was standing amidst them, she caught the headscarf and hid it in her clothes. She fell on the ground, crawling on her chest and her belly, wanting to get out from among them so that they would not take away the headscarf from her.</p>
<p>The crowd, looking on, grabbed her, choked her, stretched out her hands and beat her with an iron staff. They battered her head until blood flowed freely from her. All her flesh swelled up from the severe beating. But they were unable to take that headscarf from her.</p>
<p>When the bishop saw this, he was afraid that she might die from the beating. So he approached her and said: “My dear daughter, give me the headscarf”.</p>
<p>So she handed it to him. He tore it into two pieces. He gave half of it to her and the other half to the crowd. Then he reprimanded them so they would not approach her again.</p>
<p>But the people divided amongst themselves [the half of the headscarf] thread by thread so that each one of them could place a thread in his house and be blessed by it forever.</p>
<p>Their rejoicing and love for Our Lady Mary increased whenever they saw her, because seeing with the eye is greater than hearing with the ear. The word of the Gospel, which says “many prophets and kings desired to see what you have seen, but did not see it, and to hear what you have heard, but did not hear it”  was fulfilled with them. </p>
<p>This miracle happened every year.</p>
<p>When the people gathered at this monastery, the governor of Al-Maḥallah province – who was appointed by the sultan of Egypt to go every year to this holy monastery, in which Our Lady Holy Virgin Mary appears – approached them. He set up his tent there in order to guard the belongings of the people, their women and children, who had gathered for the feast.</p>
<p>The Muslims would give the officer bribes and ask him to bring them into the Christian church.</p>
p>When the Muslims saw Our Lady Mary they were amazed and astonished at her beautiful appearance and splendor. The Muslims did not want to leave. [They left] only due to the severe action of the administrator, who sent in troops to drive them out so that they would not become Christians when they saw this miracle. </p>
<p>On the end of the fifth day, all of those people returned to their places, [WLB: homes?] while recounting the praise of God and praising his mother, the Virgin Mary, whom they were fortunate to see. </p>
<p>Blessed are you, my dear children, who were fortunate to see the mother of God, the pure Mary, as well as the luminous angels, the crowned martyrs, the striving saints.  May God make us and you deserving to hear her miracles with a burning heart and a pure mind that does not speak idly about the grief of this world. And may God give salvation and peace of rejoicing and goodness to our king, Zara Yacob, who is called Constantine, and may he subdue his enemies and opponents[, putting them] under his feet. May he show us, united with him, the sanctuary of his mother, the Virgin. This piece[, the miracle story,] that we have now written is the report of your love[, my dear children].  May the blessings of her prayers be with our King Zara Yacob, forever and ever, amen. Translation as of 05/21/22]</p>

35-B,Däbrä Metmaq miracles: The annual apparition of Saint Mary at Däbrä Metmaq.,Africa Egypt confirmed (Dabra Mǝtmāq),"<p>As was once said by Our Lord, during the first year, at the end of the construction and of the consecration of Dabra Metmâq in the name of Our Lady Mary the Virgin, the twenty-first of genbot, the monks were assembled after morning prayer. When they wanted to go see to the bread of the Eucharist, there arrived suddenly for them a great light, truly marvelous.</p>
<p>They thought that the monastery had caught fire because of the force of the light that had come.</p>
<p>After a little moment, the light became a resemblance of a little boat in the middle cupola of the church, towards the east. When the monks saw that, they were amazed and stupefied.</p>
<p>While they were in stupefaction, behold that they caught sight of Our Lady Mary Mother of God, Michel to her right and Gabriel to her left. They embarked (?) in the boat of light.</p>
<p>The monks felt a great fear. They did not know that it was the pure Virgin.</p>
<p>They did not recognize the angels that were with her, either. It seemed to the monks [them] that they were ghosts.</p>
<p>While they were in stupefaction, a voice called to them, saying, “Do not be afraid, I am Mary, the Mother of God Jesus Christ. Those who are to my right and my left are Michel and Gabriel. I arrived in this place by the order of my beloved Son, to accomplish that which he promised me of his holy mouth. Behold, look at this, you all, and rejoice with a joy that does not perish. Hasten yourselves now and go to the cities which are close to your home, make them know of that which you have seen with your eyes and of that which you have heard with your ears.</p>
<p>“Call to them, so that they arrive and see the miracle of my beloved Son, which he promised me would take place in this church, so that my beloved Son will be glorified with his Father and the Holy Spirit.”</p>
<p>When the monks heard that from Our Lady, the holy Virgin Mary Mother of God, they hastened to go to the cities, near and far from them. They narrated this to the Christian people.</p>
<p>Immediately men, women, and children gathered. They arrived at the holy monastery. When they arrived in the church, they saw Our Lady Mary Mother of God sitting in the middle of the boat of light and the angels standing to her right and to her left.</p>
<p>The twenty-four priests of the sky came too, with their censers and the fume of sweet-smelling incense.</p>
<p>The fume came out of their burners, came into being and filled the sanctuary.</p>
<p>They gave to Our Lady the incense according to their number [selon leur nombre].</p>
<p>They inclined their heads before her and she blessed them.</p>
<p>They looked also at the surroundings of the boat of light, standing, the little children killed by Hérode, playing before her, one mounted on the shoulders of another, jumping and kissing each other.</p>
<p>Also [encore], came the twelve apostles.</p>
<p>The seventy-two disciples prostrated before her and she blessed them. </p>
<p>When the people had seen that, they rejoiced.</p>
<p>In the greatness of their joy, their soul wished to separate from their body.</p>
<p>And so, they cried out together, saying, “Greetings to you, Virgin full of grace, God is with you! Blessed are you among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb ! We proclaim you happy with Elisabeth your kin. How has this grace fallen to us: that you come beside us, Mother of God? Indeed, we are sinners and wretches.”</p>
<p>One bishop, the holder of the seat [le titulaire du siège] of the city, arrived there.</p>
<p>He cried out in a great voice, saying, “Bless me, o my Lady mother of the Lord Jesus Christ!”</p>
<p>And he prostrated himself before her.</p>
<p>He raised his eyes towards her. The bishop saw her.</p>
<p>All the people saw her right hand while she was blessing the bishop and the people three times with the sign of the cross.</p>
<p>The bishop praised her as before, together with all the people, everyone having faith, the love of martyrs, of the just and of the saints, and making their commemoration.</p>
<p>They would ask Our Lady Mary Mother of God to show them he who (they had asked for).</p>
<p>He would come beside her immediately. He would prostrate himself before the boat of light where the Holy Virgin was.</p>
<p>She would bless him, he would turn around and go away.</p>
<p>When another martyr was passing by him who was going away, they would kiss and mutually greet each other.</p>
<p>The one among the martyrs who came first was the lord Georges.</p>
<p>Next Theodore.</p>
<p>Next Mercure.</p>
<p>Next Claude.</p>
<p>Next others among the martyrs.</p>
<p>When anyone among the people would ask by saying, “O my Lady, Holy Twice-Virgin Mary Mother of God, make so-and-so come,” she would make him come immediately.</p>
<p>Yes, among the martyrs, it was Georges, he would arrive before the people mounted on a white horse.</p>
<p>All the people would see him prostrating himself before Our Lady, having descended from his horse. She would bless him with her hand.</p>
<p>Having been blessed, he would turn around and draw away a little. Next he would mount his horse and go away. All the people would see him.</p>
<p>In the same way, all the martyrs and saints would act.</p>
<p>Each one among the people would see he who they wanted.</p>
<p>He would arrive with the appearance that he had during his life and the horse that he mounted, with the appearance that it had in bygone days, whether it were white, chestnut, or black. Indeed, all the martyrs had a familiar appearance. Their horses as well.</p>
<p>As is painted on their icon, the horse of the lord Georges is white, the horse of Theodore is chestnut and the horse of Mercure is black.</p>
<p>The same for the monks.</p>
<p>Abbâ Antoin has a known look and his clothing as well.</p>
<p>In the same way abbâ Macaire, abbâ Chenouté and the others, through patriarchs abbâ Abraham, abbâ Marc, abbâ Matthieu and those who are like them.</p>
<p>If someone asked Our Lady Mary Mother of God fervently (for a holy character), she would make him come and he would be blessed by her.</p>
<p>All the people would look at him under the appearance by which they recognized him when he was alive. When the bishop was having a rest (?), the people of his diocese were arriving at this monastery.</p>
<p>They would make their request to Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary Mother of God.</p>
<p>So that they would see the character, she would make him come beside them. They would regard him attentively.</p>
<p>The character would rejoice as they were blessed by her.</p>
<p>Yes, among the Christians who had died and had been saved, a brother asked that Our Lady would make him see his brother who had died, a father his son who had died, a daughter her mother, immediately Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary Mother of God, would make them come to the interior of the cupola.</p>
<p>They would prostrate themselves before her and she would bless them.</p>
<p>Seeing them, the people would rejoice greatly with their kin.</p>
<p>They would praise Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary Mother of God.</p>
<p>They would redouble gestures [marques] of honor in her regard, each in the language which had been given to him by God.</p>
<p>It was for them as if they had been in heaven, for the fact [fait] of joy, that would touch them at that moment, of contemplating the mother of God.</p>
<p>The mother of the Savior of the world would intercede unabated [de plus belle] for the pardon of their sins.</p>
<p>In the greatness of the joy of seeing her face, each man among them would say to her, “Appear to me, o my Lady, Holy Twice-Virgin Mary mother of God, in another clothing, that is not on you right now.”</p>
<p>She would change her clothing and appear to them. </p>
<p>Sometimes she would appear to them in green clothing. </p>
<p>Sometimes she would appear to them in clothing of the color of fire.</p>
<p>Sometimes she would appear to them in clothing of the color of the sky.</p>
<p>In numerous different colors of clothing, she would appear to those who requested it of her. She would not neglect their request.</p>
<p>Each time that she changes her clothing, a clothing of light would unfold before her. She would be concealed from the people.</p>
<p>After having stayed for a little while, the clothing of light would be removed from before her.</p>
<p>She would appear before the people in the color of clothing that they had requested of her. They would rejoice greatly for this.</p>
<p>Above all, everyone would rejoice when they saw with their eyes their relative, under the appearance and aspect that he had in his lifetime.[Translation as of 05/21/22]</p>

36,Däbrä Metmaq miracles: Mary punishes the untrustworthy camel driver of Däbrä Metmaq who steals from it.,Africa Egypt confirmed (Dabra Mǝtmāq),"<p>There was in this Dabra Metmâq where Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, had made a miracle, a man, a poor Christian, a camel driver (employed) for the needs of the monastery and (transporting) all the foodstuffs [denrées] which had been assembled by the monk brothers. Some Christians sent these foodstuffs through the poor Christian’s [his] mediation [entremise].  He removed them and dispersed them on the road. He only made a little come [provenir] to the monks. At all times, he harbored prejudice against the monks, but they were patient towards him. </p>
<p>They said, “If we drive this poor Christian out of his employment as a camel driver, his children will die of hunger. God will hold us to account for them [leur sujet]. On the contrary, leave him be : maybe he will turn away from his erroneous way of acting.”</p>
<p>But each day the man redoubled the sin, misdeeds and fraud.</p>
<p>One year, when the festival of the monastery was close, the monks took him with them so that he would load up the camels. They went to the region of Cairo for that which they needed in order to celebrate the festival. Indeed, they received a certain contribution from the people of Cairo: each year, they gave presents to the monastery to the extent that they could.</p>
<p>When they had prepared the merchandise of the monastery – wax/polish [cire], oil, and food --, they loaded it onto the camels and sent them through the mediation of the poor Christian [the man]. When he returned the goods from Cairo, he arrived at home. His home was halfway between Cairo and the monastery.  When he entered, he took the larger part of the foodstuffs which had been sent through his mediation and gave it to his wife. He took the other part to the monks who were in the monastery. When they saw this part, they were very distressed.</p>
<p>They said, “What are these foodstuffs that are not sufficient for the festival!”</p>
<p>Then they entered into the church where Our Lady Mary had appeared and they bowed their faces to the ground [se prosternèrent sur leur face à terre].</p>
<p>They said, “ O Our Lady Mary Twice-Virgin, as true as Jesus Christ is living, if you do not make a miracle of this man who steals your property all the time, we will not serve your church and will not celebrate your festival ever again.”</p>
<p>Then they left the church, distressed and in tears.</p>
<p>There was a man amongst the Arabs, a stranger, holding himself before the medial door of the church. When the monks had taken from the Christian camel driver the foodstuffs which he had brought to them, that man there moved away from the medial door of the church.</p>
<p>He slept to rest a little from the fatigue of the road next to the Bedouin. That man there saw a brilliant woman who shined seven times brighter than the sun, exited through the door of the church and, with her, two radiant men, one to her right and the other to her left. Then she signaled to him who was to her right to give her the staff [baton] in the form of a cross which was in his hand. When he gave her the staff in the form of a cross, she took it and pierced the side of the camel driver.</p>
<p>After that, she entered into the church, holding the staff, with the radiant man through the door through which she had exited. When she disappeared from his sight, the Bedouin stood up quickly and went beside the camel driver. He found his pierced side, blood flowing out. He felt a great fear. He went beside the monks and told them all that he had seen. When these men went beside the camel driver, they saw the blood flowing from his side and that he was not moving. They found him dead.</p>
<p>And so, they took him and buried him in the monastery. </p>
<p>When the Bedouin – that which meant “country dweller” – saw all that had happened, he begged the monks to become the camel driver in the place of the man. The monks rejoiced of this and entrusted to him the camels of the monastery.</p>
<p>Then he asked the monks to make him Christian and to justify him [le justifier] completely in the eyes of the Muslims.</p>
<p>They went beside the patriarch abbâ Gabriel  and informed him of this. He ordered them to baptize the Bedouin in the name of the Holy Trinity.</p>
<p>He stayed to serve the monastery a great service [d’un beau service].</p>
<p>One day amongst the days, he went to the cultivated lands and, having attended to the needs of the monastery, returned to the monastery; he arrived by night. Having descended from his camels that which he had loaded, to the gate of the monastery, he wanted to awaken the monks. Behold that [voici que] he heard the sound of a beautiful voice.He saw a great light exiting from the cupola of the church. The light surrounded the building.</p>
<p>There, there were radiant men.</p>
<p>He released fumes of incense like that which no man in the world had ever smelled [senti]. The Bedouin was very delighted by what he had seen. After a long moment, he heard the bell of the monastery ring.</p>
<p>When the ringing of the bell stopped, he wanted to open the door of the church and say a prayer in the middle of the night. All that he had seen and heard disappeared from his sight [à sa vue].</p>
<p>Then, he descended in haste, knocked on the door of the monastery and called the monks. When they heard his voice, they recognized him and opened the door for him. He told them what he had seen and what he had heard. Having returned to the church, they opened the door to say a prayer in the middle of the night and smelled a smooth aroma which had no equal.</p>
<p>And so, they knew that that which the Bedouin had said was exact, without lie.</p>
<p>They were graced with [honorèrent de] Our Lady Mary the most beautiful and served as before the church and the monastery of the Muslim who had become Christian.</p>
<p>This man here has been at the monastery until now, and still is.  He descended into [dans] the country of Egypt to attend to the needs of the monks. No one recognized him, outside of those sole monks.</p>
<p>Contemplate, brothers, the mercy of the pure Virgin. When (?) she knew that the heart of this man would serve a great service, she revealed to him this miracle. She turned him, far from folly and perdition, towards faith in her well-loved Son. [Translation as of 05/21/22]</p>

She believed in God and loved Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary Mother of God, with all her heart and all her thoughts. She gave alms to the poor and to the destitute for the name of Our Lady Mary Mother of God, from the labor of her hands, in proportion to her strength.</p>
<p>On Sundays, the guardian servants of the church came beside her and made great miracles and wonders appear through her. </p>
<p>One of those who had come beside her said to her, “Our mother, blessed Old Woman, stand and let us go to the town’s believers and ask them for the needs of the church, a donation of wine, incense, lamp and oil.”</p>
<p>She said yes, stood and went with him to the town’s believes to make the request. There, someone made her a donation of wine, incense, wax and oil for the lamp of the church which burned before the icon of Our Lady Mary Mother of God, mother of mercy.</p>
<p>When she had finished asking, she gathered (all) and gave it to the servant, of her own labor.</p>
<p>The servant received it and blessed it by saying, “That God, Old Woman, may give you all beautiful things.”</p>
<p>Then, he went into the church and there made the service, as was his custom each Sunday. After the Eucharistic sacrifice was concluded, the believers went beside the woman named Old Woman with many presents.</p>
<p>They said to her, “Our mother, blessed Old Woman, take these presents and give them for us to the church.”</p>
<p>She said to them, “My children, may they stay here until the servant of the church comes.”</p>
<p>They said to her, “Yes, it is you who knows.”</p>
<p>Once they had left, the servant of the church of the holy seigneur George, the maker of miracles, the star of glory, came to her.</p>
<p>He said to her, “Old Woman, chosen woman, I ask you to aid me for the church of saint George, master of martyrs.</p>
<p>She said to him yes. She stood, went and took the presents that the believers had brought to her before for Our Lady Mary Mother of God. Having taken them, she gave them to the church of the holy seigneur George the great martyr.</p>
<p>In that night which was that of holy Sunday, Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary Mother of God, came and appeared to Old Woman, the good woman, irritated towards her.</p>
<p>Mary [she] said to her, “Why did you give my presents to another church? In truth I say this to you, if I did not love you and if I did not remember your great labors, I would make you perish. Now, having risen in the morning, go quickly and bring back my presents. If you do not bring back my presents, I will come beside you from here on the eighth day and I will take you beside me in an evil death.”</p>
<p>After that, Mary kissed her, gave her the salute [salut] and rose to the skies. </p>
<p>When the moment of morning was made, Old Woman rose crying and moaning; she said, “O my Lady Mary Mother of God, have pity for me, be merciful towards me and forgive me my sin.”</p>
<p>She took back the presents and gave some other sums of money to the church of Saint George. She gave these presents to the church of Our Lady Mary Mother of God.</p>
<p>She said, “I made an error, have pity for me and be merciful towards me. Here are the presents which I had given to the church of the holy seigneur George master of martyrs, your beloved. I brought them back to you.”</p>
<p>After that, she was ill for eight days and died on Sunday, as Our Lady Mary Mother of God had promised her, not in anger but in mercy. Soon Our Lady appeared to her and kissed her; she welcomed her soul, made her rise to the sky and conducted her before her beloved Son.</p>
<p>A bishop saw this vision in his sleep, the face of the woman shining more than the light of the sun. </p>
<p>Now see, my dear brothers, the love of Our Lady Mary Mother of God: She loves those who love her, she helps those who believe in her and she gives them a beautiful reward for the labor of their hands.</p>
<p>He who offers her presents, she follows him for all days of his life and makes him inherit the kingdom of the skies which neither grows old nor perishes, by the mercy of her beloved Son.</p>

43,"The story of the blind priest, Yohannes Bakansi; Mary heals his eyes with milk from her breasts.",,"Rowan Budge; XIV THE VIRGIN MARY AND THE EGYPTIAN PRIEST JOHN [A. Fol. 28a, 1; B. Fol. 55b, 1.] NOW there was a certain priest in the city of Cairo called John Bakansi, and he dwelt in a church that had been built in the name of the martyr Markoryos (Mercurius). And the days of this man were one hundred years, and both his eyes had become blind, and he remained the whole of the previous year seeing nothing at all. And when the light of his eyes failed he began to carry out what he had taken an oath to do. Now there was in that church a picture of our Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, which looked towards the East, and after the prayer which concluded the ser vice at midnight had been said, and the monks had de parted to their cells, that priest was wont to go to the picture and to prostrate himself before it several times ; and having saluted the Virgin Mary with the salutation of the angel [Gabriel] three hundred times, he would entreat her to restore to him the sight of his eyes. And he continued to act in this wise for a whole year. And it came to pass that, at the end of a complete year, on a certain night, as he was singing the salutation of the angel according to his wont, and was standing before the picture of our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, drowsiness overtook him and he fell straightway into a deep sleep. And he had a dream, and in it he saw a most beautiful woman come forth from the picture, and she shone with a light that was seven times brighter than that of the sun. And she drew nigh unto him and took out her breasts from inside her apparel, and she pressed milk out from them upon his eyes; and then she made the sign of the Cross over him with her holy hands and disappeared into the picture. And straightway his eyes were opened, and he saw the Eikon burning with fire, and he found in his eyes milk that gave forth sweet fragrance. And he cried out, saying, ""Hail to thee, O thou who art full of grace! God is with thee""; and when the monks heard his cry they came unto him quickly, so that they might know what had happened. And the priest told them everything that he had seen, and they looked at his eyes and saw traces of the milk in them, and they laid their hands upon his eyes and saluted him. Then they went to the picture of our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, and each one of them bowed down before her, and they prostrated themselves before her as long as they were able to do so. And John the priest performed the ser vice of the consecration of the Eucharist on that day, and he administered the Holy Mysteries unto the monks and the laity. And he lived twenty years after this, and he continued to minister in the church, and he died in peace. Thou didst accept his petition and didst give him of thy spiritual milk, Wherewith thou didst unseal the eyes of John the aged.

45,"Däbrä Sedeneya miracles: The story of the icon of Saint Mary of Däbrä Sedeneya, attributed to Cyril of Jerusalem.",,"<p>(p. 47) There was a lady, in the place of Sedenya, of the name Martha, very rich and good. And one day she thought that she consumed her riches in vain like all the world and said: “How will this be of use to my soul? Like it has been said in the Gospel: If he has gained the whole world and has lost his soul, what is good for the man?  If he does not pay the price of redemption for his soul.” And , having this in mind, she wanted to do good works with her assets and reflected in her heart the work which was the best.</p>
<p>(p. 48) And in that moment she remembered Abraham, the friend of the Lord, and just as he with hospitality for strangers made himself worthy to receive the Holy Trinity in his house.  And likewise  Lot, because for love of guests he had in his home dwelling two archangels.  And then the sister of Lazarus, Martha, loved very much to accommodate the poor; and this she made her work that her home was worthy to be a place of repose for our Lord, during his wandering, in the month of pardon and in the day of salvation,  like it was said: “The guest will be called the Son of God”. And, understanding in her heart that these three actions were the best among all, she built a vast lodging for pilgrims. And from that day, she began to keep the best table (for the pilgrims), like the King prepared a nuptial banquet for his son,  having the Heavenly bridegroom; and every day greatly increased the hospitality for the brothers. </p>
<p>And, after they had eaten and drunk, she spoke with them about spiritual things and asked them the stories of the ancient Fathers. (pg. 49) And one day the brothers came together, like the custom, to spend the night in her house.  And she, like every day, held profitable discourses with them. And then they recalled for her that there were in Jerusalem painters of an icon of Our Lady, the doubly-sainted Virgin Mary, Mother of God. And she begged them with tears, saying: ‘Is there someone among you who goes to Jerusalem? For I give him a great amount of gold to acquire for me from those painters an icon of Mary my Lady’. And, a monk having understood the loving discourse from that woman for the Virgin said: ‘I go and with my gold I will buy it and bring it to you (the icon). And, on my return to you, I will take the gold (from you) in the measure of what I will have spent. (p. 50) And then she kissed his feet and thanked him much. </p>
<p>He left in the morning (the monk), he went forth  and he arrived in Jerusalem. And, he achieved all his purposes there, he remembered that which the lady asked him to buy. Then, he bought an icon with a beautiful appearance. And he said that this icon should be painted by Luke the Evangelist. And that monk, taking her, placed her in his chest and went on his way towards Sedeneya. And, while he went along the road, a roaring lion moved to kill him. And he stood filled with awe  and he was frightened by the terror of the lion. And, while he was in fear, that icon cried out and spoke with a majesty seven times greater than the roar of the lion. Then  the lion fled immediately, terrified as if a horseman followed him and was going to kill him. And that monk continued (further), amazed to have heard the voice of the icon. </p>
<p>Then, when marauders attacked him, used to kill and to plunder (p. 51), as we said before, the icon cried out in a great voice like that of lightning.  And those bandits fled for great terror,  without understanding from where that cry came. And, when that monk listened and saw those amazing miracles, he thought in his heart and he said: “I will take (the icon) to my country, which is Ethiopia, because she is my Helper,  as I saw in the two miracles”. But he neglected that that icon had come by her own will to stay with the nun who loved her from the bottom of her heart [Ma egli' ignorava che quella icone era venuta per sua volonta per restare con la monaca che l'amava dal profondo del cuore.]. In fact, it seemed to him that he had bought it with his own money and carried her, outside of Her will, like every other object bought by pilgrims. Therefore, he said: “I will neither give her to that woman nor will I go on the road which leads to her house; instead I will go by the way of my country”. And, while he was thinking thus and he counseled himself in his heart, he reached the shore of the sea.</p>
<p>He found many ships and churches for the sailors (pg. 52): “In which place will you land on the shore?” One answered him: “To Sedenya”.  And he left that man and he did not go with him. Another said: “I go through another place towards the country of Ethiopia’. (The monk) boarded this ship. And, when they reached the middle of the sea, a stormy wind rose and carried him against his will across to the port of Sedenya.</p>
<p>So he set out on that road and he came to the house of Martha saying in his heart: “For where ever will she recognize that I am that one who she begged to buy her the icon?” And he went into her house and spent the night with the travelers. In the morning he wanted to depart outside with them to go on his way. He joined the travelers at the door of the cloister and those men went out. But that monk was not able to leave because the door closed before him by the miracle of Our Lady the doubly-sainted Virgin Mary, Mother of God. But the door of the cloister was not changed for the others before him, it remained open to those who entered and left.</p>
<p>(pg. 53) It was the custom for Martha to accompany the pilgrims until the door of the cloister to give, to those who did not have them, provisions for the needs of the trip. When she saw the monk who tried to leave and was not able, she said: “Father, here I see you like a sick man. Stay! You will go away tomorrow; because my house was built for the hospitality of guests”.  He consented. The next day, when he wanted to go out again, he was not able, like the day before. And that woman made him spend another night. And so he did not leave on the third day the habit to leave and not be able to do it. </p>
<p>When Martha saw that for three days he had not lay like a sick man nor gone like a healthy man, she said: “Speak, father, what is this thing that has befallen you?”. And that monk opened his mouth, ashamed, and said: “Do you not recognize me whom you begged, when I went to Jerusalem you asked me to bring an icon of our Lady the doubly-sainted Virgin Mary, Mother of God?”. (pg. 54) She replied: “And how would I recognize you when there are so many of those who enter and leave from my house?”. So, he told her about all the wonders which had happened and everything which had happened to him along the way from when he had bought the icon until that day. And, having spoken thus, he pulled that icon from his breast and gave her to Martha: “Look, the all extraordinary icon!” Martha, hearing that story, prostrated herself at his feet for her love for the Virgin. And, grasping that icon from his hands, she prostrated herself and rejoiced, like the empress Elena when she found the Cross of Our Lord, so greatly that they all came together, the near and the far, to hear her shout of joy.</p>
<p>And she built for the icon a beautiful church, like Solomon built the Temple for the throne of Zion. And she drained her rest honoring her as much as she was able. And below the icon there were lamps, to the right and to the left, both day and night. And she prostrated herself in front of her and she worshipped her. Nor did she leave to rest.</p>
<p>(pg. 55) And the greatest miracle of all the wonders of that icon was that she appeared clothed by a body of the flesh, as the Three Magi found her and saw her in the grotto with the Holy Child. And tears and sweat left the icon; and those who they anointed healed from distressing maladies. It was established in all the borders of the land that that icon of Our Lady the doubly-sainted Virgin Mary, Mother of God, had arrived from Jerusalem to the place of Sedenya the tenth day of the month of maskaram. And the Bishops established that that holiday should be celebrated under penalty of excommunication. The prayer and blessing of You and the mercy of Your beloved Son be with us forever and ever!  Amen. [Translation as of 05/21/22]</p>

46,The church of Saint Mary that moved by itself to the shore of the Mediterranean Sea.,Levant probably (Constantinople),"Rowan, BudgeXIII THE VIRGIN MARY AND THE MONASTERY OF 'AKONA [A. Fol. 26b, 1; B. Fol. 54a, 1.] NOW there was in the country of the Greeks a certain monastery situated at a distance of about half a stade from a stream, and here there was a church which had been built in the name of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary. And our holy Lady Mary was wont to hold converse with a certain priest in dreams, and she said unto him, ""Build me a church on the edge of the stream."" And she continued to speak unto him in this wise for many years, and although he spake unto the monks and unto all the people they would not do as he wished. And it came to pass that, when they refused to build a church to the Virgin in the place wherein she wished, the church of the monastery, and the wall there of, and the cells of the monks, split asunder. Then the whole building moved down to the edge of the stream, and by the might of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the inner part thereof was made strong, and the church and the walls, and the cells of the monks, became firm and stable, even as they were aforetime, and the fair appearance of the church, and of its wall, and of the cells of the monks was unchanged. Now the monks who dwelt in that monastery were exceedingly numerous, and they were fast asleep on the night in which the church moved out of its place, and they knew nothing whatsoever about it until the following morning, when they went out from their cells and saw the stream in their courtyard, and all the monks uttered loud outcries and were astonished with a mighty astonishment. And they sent to the great folk of the city, and they all came, both male and female, and they marvelled when they saw this miracle, the like of which hath never been done either before or since. And they made a great feast, and they offered offerings and gave alms and oblations each year on the thirteenth day of the month Nahasse. Now the name of the monastery was 'Akona.

47,The conversion of a Muslim merchant who had been imprisoned in Naples.,,"LXXVI THE VIRGIN MARY AND THE MUSLIM WHO BECAME A CHRISTIAN [Brit. Mus. MS. Orient. No. 652. Fol. 126a, No. 106.] THERE was a certain Muslim who set out for Greece on the sea of 'Iyariko in a ship, according to his custom, and he came forth from the sea into the city of Napiil (Naples?) where there were no Muslims but only Christians. And when the people saw him they seized him and questioned him, saying unto him, ""Whence comest thou?"" And he answered and said unto them, ""I am from the city of Muslims""; and they laid hold of him and took him to the king of Ketalan. And the king answered and said unto him, ""By whose authority hast thou come unto this city?"" And the man said, ""I have no authority whatsoever. I come only to buy and to sell."" And the king answered and said unto him, ""Dost thou imagine that thou canst plunder here?"" And the king said to his servants, ""Go ye, take him to the prison house, and bind him and put fetters on his hands and feet."" And he dwelt for a space of seven years in great tribulation and affliction; now there is no place of imprisonment in this world more cruel than the city of Greece (?), and the man continued to live in affliction, and he wept, and after seven years it was impossible for him to be helped. Now there was a church [there built] in the name of our Lady Mary, and he saw miracles worked there, and the people brought gifts into it. And on that day the Muslim vowed a vow to our Lady Mary, saying, ""If thou wilt deliver me from this tribulation I will become a Chris tian slave."" And she appeared unto him in a dream in the form of a majestic woman, and she said unto him, ""Cast away thy fetters, and go to thy country, and perform what thou hast vowed."" And the man did not know her, and she appeared three days. Then he rose up and did what she commanded him, and his iron fetters fell off from his hands and feet, and he departed. And he journeyed for two days carrying his fetters, and he came to 'Iyariko and found a ship ready to sail to the country of Jerusalem. And he said to the captain, ""Give me a passage in thy ship""; and the captain of the ship said unto him, ""Give me my passage money""; and the Muslim said, ""I have no passage money, but I will become one of thy sailors."" And the captain said, ""Embark""; and he embarked on the ship. And the crew thought that he was a poor man without any money, but he was rich and was an officer of the Sultan of Egypt. And they departed and came to Jerusalem, and he removed himself and went to Gethsemane, to the grave of our Lady Mary. And his kinsfolk said unto him, ""Why dost thou not go into thy house?"" And he said unto them, ""I cannot go into my house until I have performed what I have vowed."" And then he came and pitched his tent in the Field of Olives where they seized our Lord when they crucified Him. And he came to the tomb of our Lady Mary, and fell down upon his face on the ground, and he groaned and embraced her tomb, and he related to the people what had happened unto him. And the Muslims were wroth with him, and they said unto him, ""Why didst thou not tell us on our journey? And why speakest thou among the Christians?""

48,The rich man from Colosse who was shot in the eye with an arrow while fighting the Qwez.,,"XV THE VIRGIN MARY AND THE GREEK WHOSE EYE HAD BEEN PIERCED BY AN ARROW [A. Fol. 30a, 1; B. Fol. 57a, 1.] NOW there was a certain man on the Island of Kualasyas who was exceedingly rich, and he set out in a ship with certain Turks (?) to fight against pirates who attacked him on the sea-coast; and the crew of the pirate's ship shot eleven arrows at him, and one of these smote him in the eye, and he became grievously sick and was nigh unto death. Then he said unto his men, ""Take me to my house""; and they brought him to his house. Now the ten arrows that had entered his body came out, but the one that was in his eye would not come out, and when they pulled at it, it broke and left the iron [point] in his eye. And there was in this place a certain church which was built in the name of our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, and she used to work miracles and wonders therein and to heal those who were sick; and when those who were travelling by sea and by land made entreaty unto her she was wont to deliver them immediately. And the wounded man said, ""Carry me to the house of our Lady Mary, for there is no one that can cure me except her""; and they carried him thither straightway. And they made an image of wax—for thus is the custom of the Greeks— that resembled him in appearance, and they brought eleven arrows, and stuck them into it, ten in the members of the body, and one in the eye. Now when a man was wounded either by a spear or [by an arrow from] a bow, they used to bring the spear and make a wound in the wax figure, similar to that which had been made in the man; and then, when they had made vows to our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, she used to heal him. So they brought the rich man to the church of our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, and he made numerous gifts to the poor and needy, and he gave that which was meet for the church itself. And it came to pass that, when our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, saw that the confidence of his heart was in her, she plucked the arrow out of the eye of the waxen figure and out of the eye of the wounded man in the same night; and the eye of the wounded man became once more like its fellow. And when the people saw the eye of the man and that of the figure, they marvelled at the greatness of this miracle which our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, the God-bearer, had wrought, and they praised her exceedingly. O Mary, the life of those who are sick, who didst heal the wound of The rich Greek whose eye had been pierced by a dart, As I proclaim thy wondrous deed so that men may understand thy marvellous act, Make my heart to expand with joy, and let me have health, So that after everything hath come to an end I may hold converse [with thee].

We chose you and we come among you so that we might tarry and live with you.” The virgins spoke thusly to Mary, and they joined themselves to her and ministered to her day and night. Those women attended her, as it had been said to her [Mary], until our lord Jesus Christ, the son of the living Lord, would be born from her without intercourse of a man. And Mary, the mother of light, who from then on loved those virgins fiercely, told them everything that they wished to hear; they ministering, sought her and adored her; they washed her feet and perfumed her dresses, and they honored Mary because of the miracles which they saw and the prophetic signs which Mary made openly before them day and night. And this was the first miracle which the virgins saw; when Mary was present, the sweet odor of frankincense filled the house just like a wave on the ocean, and all those afflicted with illnesses and diseases came to her, and they would seek blessing from that woman, and they adored her and were healed of their diseases. And those virgins marveled when they saw the great glory that surrounded Mary.  </p>

52,Däbrä Mətmaq miracles: Bishop Michael sends Deacon John to help the monks of Däbrä Metmaq celebrate Passion Week.,Africa Egypt confirmed (Dabra Mǝtmāq),"<p>There was a man in the days of the episcopate of Abbâ Michael of the monastery of Metmâq.</p>
<p>Monks from the monastery came to the bishop when the feast of Easter approached. They told him to send them priests to aid them during the week of the Passion and of Easter.</p>
<p>Near the bishop was a deacon well-versed in the Scriptures, his name was John; he lived beside the house of the bishop.</p>
<p>The bishop commanded him to go with the monks and to celebrate with them the Passion and Easter.</p>
<p>When he heard these words, the deacon grieved strongly and, out of fear of the bishop, went with the monks against his will.</p>
<p>When he had arrived at the monastery, he celebrated with them the holy Palm Sunday.</p>
<p>Seeing that he was alone among the monks, the man thought within his heart and said, “If I were in my country, I would be reassured [réconforté] to sing before my parents, my acquaintances and my brother deacons.</p>
<p>“But tomorrow, if God approves and so wills it, I will return to Sandafâ.</p>
<p>“And may the bishop - of whom we formerly spoke - do with me as he will [me fasse ce qu’il veut].”</p>
<p>After this, he fell asleep that night.</p>
<p>So the monks woke for the prayer in the middle of the night, on Monday morning.</p>
<p>John the deacon entered the church to pray with them.</p>
<p>When morning came, he wanted to go, according to what he had thought, without the monks knowing.</p>
<p>Having entered the church, he saw a tall column of light in the middle of the church. Upon this was an icon of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, Mother of God.</p>
<p>Seeing this, he fell to the earth and prostrated himself before the icon.</p>
<p>He said, “If this column of light and this icon that I see stay in this church, I will not leave before the day of Easter.”</p>
<p>Then he cried out of a burning heart, saying, “I implore you, O my merciful and forgiving Lady, pardon me for what I thought within my heart!”</p>
<p>When the monks heard his cry, they questioned him.</p>
<p>He recounted to them how he had thought to act, how he had wanted to flee far from them, and how he had seen the column of light and the icon that was upon it.</p>
<p>God opened the eyes of the monks and they saw the column of light and the icon; they rejoiced strongly.</p>
<p>They said, “Let’s send messengers and inform the bishop and all the people of this affair.”</p>
<p>One of the monks said, “Let’s wait out the rest of the night and tomorrow, if the column of light that we see has not disappeared, we will take this back to the bishop and to the people.”</p>
<p>In the morning, the column of light had not changed. The monks hurried and informed the bishop.</p>
<p>Arriving beside them with priests, deacons, monks, and numerous people, the bishop saw the column of light and also the icon that was upon it.</p>
<p>They felt a great joy.</p>
<p>The light of the column was not changed and remained in the middle of the church.</p>
<p>The icon of Our Lady Mary (remained)  upon it until the day of the Holy Resurrection.</p>
<p>After the (eucharistic)  mystery had been completed, the column disappeared from the view of the people.</p>

<p>The custom of the monks, each year, before the coming of the festival of the monastery, was to hire [engager] people and give them camels: the monks [they] would bring them water and refill the cisterns. Indeed, the water was far from the monastery. There came one year, as the festival of the monastery approached, when the camels were late. The monks took fright and said, “If the people arrive here during the festival and do not find water, they will die of thirst.”</p>
<p>At the monastery there was a donkey. They gave the donkey to one of the monks so that he could drive it and load It up with water. When the monk left, he began to cry from a burning heart and said, “Of what use is this sole donkey? Even if there remained three months to load him with water, he would not refill the cistern!”</p>
<p>When he returned to the monastery, he told his monk brothers that which he had thought in his heart on the road.</p>
<p>They said to him, “What you said, our dear brother, and what will you do, as there are only three days before the coming of the festival?”</p>
<p>They decided together to enter into the church and to beg Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary Mother of God, so that she would make the camels of the monastery arrive quickly or, if not, that she would arrange for the monks according to that which was necessary.</p>
<p>Next, they entered into the church, asking for mercy, falling on their face and prostrating themselves on the ground, crying much, and begging intensely the mother of life, Our Lady, the pure and Twice-Virgin Mary, to arrange for them according to that which she would wish and choose.</p>
<p>They exited the church, hoping in God and in his mother, Our Lady Mary. They passed all the night in a great distress. </p>
<p>When it was the middle of the night, God stirred up a violent wind, so much so that the walls of the monastery were rattled by the force of the wind which had risen. The wind lifted also the water (from the river), so much so that it was made to come to the cistern.</p>
<p>The cistern was refilled. The monks did not know that, but they thought that it was only the sound of the wind.</p>
<p>In the morning, the monks exited and found the water entered into the cistern, having filled it up to the rim. The water remained (high) until the end of the festival. </p>
<p>All the people arrived according to their custom and saw the wonder which had been produced: the coming of the water to the monastery.

Fol. 22b, 1.] NOW there was a picture of our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, in the Monastery of the Nagadyan; and it was in the room wherein the sick lay, and it faced the East, and every morning those who were sick therein committed themselves to its protection and care. And it came to pass that there was in that room a certain man who had lain there sick for many days, and each day he used to speak unto our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, saying, ""O my Lady, thou wilt never be able to raise me up unless I can come to the city of Jerusalem and worship at the place where on the foot of our Lord stood."" And whilst he was making entreaty in this wise our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, appeared unto him by night, and said unto him, ""Be not sad, but come so that I may trans port thee to the place where thou hast longed and de sired to be."" And straightway she carried him to Jerusalem where our Lord was buried, and to Bethlehem where He was born, and to the Jordan wherein He was baptized; and straightway she dipped the sick man in the water, and she made him go to the Mount of Olives, and to Mount Zion where our Lord abode with His disciples. And she said unto him, ""Rejoice and be glad, for I have fulfilled for thee everything which thou hast asked of me, and after the Festival of the Nativity I will take thee unto myself."" And at that moment the sick man rejoiced greatly, and he died in peace, even as our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, promised him. May her prayer and her blessing, and the mercy of her beloved Son, be with our King David for ever and ever! Amen. A vine-cluster is Mary, the taste of the fruit of which is sweet, And tender is the beauty of her flower.

57,The widow who could not find husbands for her three daughters.,Africa Ethiopia probably,"XVII THE VIRGIN MARY AND THE THREE POOR SISTERS [A. Fol. 35a, 1; B. Fol. 35b, 1.] NOW there was a certain poor widow whose husband had died and had left three daughters: the name of the first was Mary, and that of the second Martha, and that of the third Yawahita. And their mother was exceedingly poor, and lacked even the daily bread unless the people gave it unto her; and it came to pass that, when her three daughters had grown up and were of the proper age to marry, no man of that city thought of marrying them because of their poverty. Now their mother was exceedingly grieved because of this thing, and she went into the church of our holy Lady, the twofold Virgin, Mary, which was in Sen'a, and is called Tayada, weeping bitterly. And she stood up before the picture of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, and said, ""O Lady, I have brought up these my daughters until this day, but behold, I now lack by reason of my poverty the means for giving them in marriage, and I have no power to do anything whatsoever. O thou mother of orphans, remove my sorrow."" And in that same night our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, appeared unto her, and said unto her, ""This night I will take thine eldest daughter unto myself so that she may be with me, for she is a pledge committed unto me. And as concerning thy two other daughters I will send them unto Tewog, the blacksmith of the town of Makmas, who shall receive them from thee and shall marry them to his sons."" And when the woman awoke from her sleep she believed the words of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary. And after three days, the eldest daughter, whose name was Mary, died. And when the neighbours heard that she was dead they came to make her ready for burial and to bury her, and they saw that her mother was rejoicing and was not weeping at all. Then one of those who had come to comfort her said unto her, ""Why dost thou harden thy heart, and why dost thou not weep for thy daughter?"" And she made known unto her what our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, had said unto her in the vision, and they ascribed praise unto the glorious and Most High God, and unto the Virgin who had given Him birth, the merciful intercessor for the sons of men. And they buried the maiden Mary with great honour. And after a few days Tewog, the blacksmith, came from the city of Mekmas, and took the two daughters and gave them in marriage unto his sons. And he himself undertook the provision of marriage portions for them, for the sake of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, and her Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, who were with Joseph and Salome when they went to the land of Egypt. Now the history of the blacksmith is written in the Homily on our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, which is read on the sixth day of the month Hadar, on the festival of Kuesquam. O Mary, thou Queen, with all thy children Who make their boast of thee, thou mother of Israel.

Fol. 32a, 1; B. Fol. 33b, 1.] NOW there was a certain man in the country of Upper Egypt, who was surnaraed ""Badraman,"" and whose name was ""Abraham,"" and the name of his wife was ""Gera Anest""; and they were exceedingly rich in possessions, and they were perfect in every good work. And they had a daughter whose name was ""Elisabeth,"" and besides her they had no other child; and this daughter fell ill of a most loathsome disease in her body, that is to say, small-pox, and both her eyes became blind. And when her father and her mother saw the blindness of their daughter's eyes they were bitterly grieved, and they took her round to all the physicians and to all those men who dealt in magic, but they were not able to cure her. And it came to pass that when the day of the festival of our holy Lady, the twofold Virgin, Mary, that is to say, the twenty-first day of the month Tekemt (October 18), had come, her father and mother took the girl, together with many gifts, and carried her to the church of our holy Lady, the twofold Virgin, Mary, which was in the country called Dalga. Now the people of that country were wont to celebrate on that day a great festival in honour of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary; therefore the mother took her there on the twentieth day of the month Tekemt. And they went into the church and shut the door upon herself, and she stood up before the picture of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, and she stretched out her hands in the fervour of her heart, and said with bitter tears, ""O my Lady, thou mother of mercy, thou gracious intercessor, I take refuge in thee, and I entreat thee to save my daughter and to open her eyes."" And it came to pass that after she had made an end of her prayer she and her daughter straightway fell asleep under the picture [of the Virgin]. And as the daughter was sleeping with her mother, our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, appeared unto the daughter and woke her up without her mother knowing about it. Then our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, who is full of mercy, said unto her, ""Open thine eyes."" And when the maiden had opened them, the Virgin blew into them a breath from her pure mouth, and sprinkled upon her from her breasts some drops of her milk of healing and mercy; and straightway the eyes of the maiden were opened. Now our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, appeared unto her apparelled in light that was brighter than that of the sun, and then she disappeared into the picture. Then the girl awoke her mother and told her everything that had happened, and how our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, had appeared unto her, and how she had opened her eyes and disappeared into the picture; and when her mother looked at her she rejoiced exceedingly, and she uttered cries of joy in a loud voice. And the over seer of the church heard her as he was taking the bread for the Offering, and he came out to see what had happened, and he found the maiden with her mother, and she was able to see. And straightway he marvelled and was astonished, and he gave thanks unto God Almighty and to the Virgin, the merciful intercessor, who gave Him birth. And it came to pass in the morning that all the people were gathered together in the church, and when they saw this miracle they gave praise unto the glorious and Most High God. And they gave praise unto our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-bearer, and they made a great feast and glorified her name exceedingly. For the daughter of the rich man who had become blind through small-pox, Thou didst make the eyes to have light when, having journeyed to thee, she made entreaty unto thee.

61,The two brothers who copied the Miracles of Mary and fell into the doing of a sin.,Africa Ethiopia probably,"Rowan, Budge XVIII THE VIRGIN MARY AND THE TWO SCRIBES WHO WERE BROTHERS [A. Fol. 37a, 1; B. Fol. 37a, 1.] NOW there were in a certain city two beloved brethren who loved each other dearly, and they were skilled in the art of writing. And a certain man came unto one of them and asked him to write for him a copy of the Book of the Miracles of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, and that brother said, ""I consent""; and he began to write. And whilst the brother was writing the Book one committed a sinful act, and the devils came and snatched up into the air him that was writing the Book of the Miracles of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary. Now those devils who had seized upon that brother did not know the brother [they were to seize], and one of them cried out and said, ""Throw this man into perdition."" And that brother was dismayed exceedingly and trembled, for he thought that he was going to be destroyed. And our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, came, arrayed in apparel that was like unto the colour of heaven, and she said unto the devils who were carrying that brother away, ""Why are ye carrying away this man to perdition, for he and his brother were to write the Book of my Miracles?"" And having said these words unto them, she delivered the man from their hands, and he came down little by little from the sky and returned unto the place where he was formerly. And when the man awoke from his sleep he marvelled at the vision which he had seen, and he told his companions everything that had happened unto him, and how the devils had come upon him, and how our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-bearer, had de livered him. Then the man repented with a great repentance and saved himself from perdition. Unto thee turned from the unseemly path of error The two brethren who were wont to write thy name. O Mary, thou doer of deeds of gracious kindness, thou bloom above every flower, Before thy beauty and thy lovely graciousness The rejected brother became acceptable, and that false man pleasing.

62,Ethiopian kings: The abbot who did not allow the Miracles of Mary to be read in his monastery.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed,"<p>It happened in one of the Christian countries. And it was a great country and its inhabitants, kings, bishops and the whole people, men and women, loved Our Lady the holy two-fold Virgin Mary, Mother of God, with all their strengths, with all their soul and with all their thoughts; and they relied day and night on her to protect them and they always had in their mouths the mention of His name. And out of love for the Virgin they united together Kings and Bishops and priests and deacons and monks; and they kept the good advice to have the Book of Miracles of Our Lady read in all their lands, in all her feasts, to rejoice in hearing her miracles and wonders, which she did by the might of His Only Begotten Jesus Christ. So the king sent the Book of Miracles of Our Lady to many churches to read them and rejoice.</p>
<p>But a monk, who was nebura ed, heard that the King had sent the Book of Miracles of Our Lady to the churches, and said, “I will not bring into my monastery, at all, the Book of Miracles of Our Lady the two-fold holy Virgin Mary, Mother of God, whatever they do to me.”</p>
<p>Someone who had heard him say this asked him: “And why on earth, Abba, will you not bring into your monastery the Book of Miracles of Our Lady, the saint two-fold Virgin Mary, Mother of God.”</p>
<p>He replied “I have taught my disciples a rigorous doctrine according to the (spiritual) struggle of the monks. Some of them live in solitude; some others in abstinence. When they hear the Book, and hear how it saved many sinners who had committed great sins, they will abandon their monasteries and their spiritual struggle and they will give themselves over to relaxation."" This speech by that monk was not pleasing to God or Our Lady the holy two-fold Virgin Mary, Mother of God.</p>
<p>And five months after he had given that speech, while he was on the way with many monks and resting from the fatigue of the journey while talking about their things, suddenly the call of death reached him and he died in the blink of an eye without even being able to finish the speech that he had in his mouth.</p>
<p>The monks were terrified and marveled, saying to each other: “What does this sudden death mean? So what is the end of man?' [So then is it the end of man?]</p>
<p>So it was the death of that monk who had said: “I will not bring into my monastery the Book of Miracles of Our Lady the two-fold holy Virgin Mary, Mother of God, so that my disciples do not learn relaxation and say: ‘We will be saved by her prayers as many sinners have been saved who asked you for protection!'. Just as he said, 'I will not introduce (the Book of) “Her Miracles,” just so he himself did not enter that monastery after saying that.</p>
<p>O dear brothers, I ask you: Explain to me: why do you say that Christians must not listen to the Book of Miracles of Our Lady (f. 50 v) the holy two-fold Virgin, Mary, the mother of God, in order not to commit sins? Have any of you found in the Book of Miracles of Our Lady, the holy two-fold Virgin, Mary, the mother of God, (one passage) that says: “Sin and you will not be punished?! If you heard that many sinners were saved whom Satan had misled, why on earth will you be distressed if they were saved by the prayers of Our Lady? It would instead be right for you rejoice in the salvation of sinners through the intercession of Our Lady the holy two-fold Virgin, Mary, the mother of God! It’s not just sinners, not even the righteous are saved by their own justice, but rather by the intercession of Her (Mary) and the mercy of Her Son. Thus no one is saved by his actions alone, if the mercy of the Lord is not upon him; nor is any sinner lost due to his sin, if the mercy of the Lord is upon him.</p>
<p>And you, my dear ones, honor the Miracles of Our Lady the holy two-fold Virgin Mary, Mother of God, like the Gospel of Her Son, and read her miracles in gladness so that you may enter for prayer into the banquet of her son with her.[Translation as of 05/21/22]</p>

And it came to pass that being in prison, having been condemned by the judges to suffer there for many days, one day he fell asleep suddenly. And on the twenty-fifth day of the month Genbot, at the eleventh hour of the night, our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, came into the prison-house in the form of a dove, and with her outspread wings covered over the place in his head where the wound was. And he woke up straightway, and raised up his hands in the air and took hold of her wings, and she flew out of the prison-house and de parted; now she was shining with splendour like the sun. And as soon as she had laid her hands upon his head George knew that he had been made whole, and a mighty strength came into his body; and he rejoiced greatly and was exceedingly glad, because she had graciously bestowed upon him health and healing. And he remained without eating and drinking for four days, because of the exceedingly great joy that filled his heart through the beauty and sweet odour of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-bearer.

69,"Romeya cycle: Mareqos, King of Romeya, abandons his throne secretly to become a monk.",,"<p>There was a virtuous king who believed in God, his name was Mark. He reigned for ten years in the city of Rome in virginity and purity, without stain or smear.</p>
<p>Virgin, he was not it only in the temple of his body – abstaining from approaching women --, but he was also a virgin free from [vierge de] dishonest words and pointless and harmful speech.</p>
<p>Although he was king, he was a virgin, in the plentitude of his spirit, from thoughts of vengeance, prosecution and envy. He was also a virgin free from irascible and bad-tempered speech; he was shielded by all the beautiful actions and by faith. During all the days of his reign, no man pronounced words of dispute or quarrel, nor seditious words. One did not hear words of war or murder. During all his days, there was neither thief nor dispossessor nor unjust man.</p>
<p>All his soldiers made works of peace and love, as the prophet said, With a just man you will be just, with a pure man you will be pure, with one of God’s elect [un homme élu] you will be elected .</p>
<p>It is also said of God’s chosen kings [rois élus] who are like him: As the king is, his ministers will be .</p>
<p>After, for ten years, he had accomplished in such a beautiful way of acting and with such faith, all the dignitaries of Rome assembled by the king. </p>
<p>They begged him together and said to him, “O our leader, we implore you, we your servants, to tell us yes and to not make us ashamed. We do not implore you for vain things and for a secular desire, but on the contrary for you to command that your kingdom be upright and beautiful, o leader.”</p>
<p>The king responded to his dignitaries and said to them, “Let me know, I pray you, that which you have said to yourselves.”</p>
<p>They said to him, “Behold our request, o king; listen, our seigneur. You are chosen, loved and recognized by God and man. Now, this is our request: God created (mankind) male and female. He blessed them and said to them, ‘Cross-breed and multiply, refill the Earth . All the commandment of God is legitimate and honest [régulier]. It is not sullied, but it is pure, holy and honored. Because of this word, we implore you to marry a woman according to the law of God, and thus your kingdom will be upright and firm.”</p>
<p>The king responded and said to them, “Behold that you have dwelled with me for ten years and never has such a declaration been made. Never such a remark of your part has been heard. (I do not know ?) who showed you this opinion and who has made you conceive of such a thought. But grant me a little time and give me a period of seven days, until I have spoken to Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary Mother of God. After that, I will give you a response for this which you have implored me.”</p>
<p>The dignitaries held silence until the term which had been fixed for them, according to what the king had said to them.</p>
<p>Next, the king rose from his throne as was his habit. He held himself before the icon of Our Lady Mary and implored her with a valiant heart and fervent thought, by saying, “O my Lady, you know well all the secrets of my thought and you plumb my heart and my kidneys. Behold that I invoke you from the bottom of my heart, o my Lady: Hear my words. May your ear lend attention to the words of my request. For the love of you and the love of your Son, I have dwelled for ten years in virginity on my royal throne. How will I compel the dignitaries of Rome who confront me about my marriage? Is it from you that their words and opinion come, or is it of their own will that they act, o my Lady?”</p>
<p>After he finished his prayer as he had been accustomed to do, and so shone and broke the glory from the face of the icon. The king was stupefied and stunned by the appearance of light from the face of the icon and prostrated himself to the ground, on his face.</p>
<p>Then Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, responded to him and said, “Listen, my friend, to this which I will say to you: I know well the secrets of your heart, how much you love me from the bottom of your heart in a purity without stain. As for that which your dignitaries said to you, these words do not come from me, but it is by the will of their heart and by the agreement of their thought that they spoke. But as for you, may the days of your life be in this way: in the unsullied purity, because I love your sanctity which has neither been desecrated nor dirtied by the mark of sin. Now, be firm and strong, leave this world and all your honors and be my Son, having tasked yourself with the yoke of his cross, because the earthly kingdom is transitory. But you, search for the kingdom of the skies.”</p>
<p>She ordered him also to reside in the desert in the space [l’écart] of men. </p>
<p>She showed him the place and said to him, Be there and reside in the monastery of Tormâq. There, arduous torments and great temptations will come to you: be strong and enduring for the kingdom of the skies.”</p>
<p>Having said that, Our Lady Mary blessed Mark the king, gave him peace and ascended to the skies.</p>
<p>The king prostrated himself before her icon and took leave from her. He wrote throughout how he rejected his royalty and his honors for the love of Our Lady Mary and departed from his royal palace, clothed in rags, without a soul seeing him (anymore) until he died and entered the kingdom of the skies.

<p>He saw three suns equal in size and in brilliance; only one light emanated from them: it is the union of the divinity.</p>
<p>The father Peter saw this mystery; he heard a loud voice, full of majesty, coming from the Father, as had heard Peter, leader of the apostles, and Zebedee’s son on Mount Tabor.</p>
<p>This took place on Sunday as communion ended.</p>
<p>At the end of the consecration, a cloud covered the altar and Peter saw in the paten a small child of beautiful appearance, on the altar, as the Father pointed at the small child, within the cloud, and said, “This is my Son, in whom I am well pleased.” </p>

79,"The wife of Mark, a priest from Mallawi in Egypt, is cured of her leprosy during the time of Patriarch Matthew",Africa Egypt probably,"<p>There was a man, (a priest), amongst the people of Mallawi who had a woman upon whom had come leprosy, in the groin, of the shape of a little loaf of bread. </p>
<p>The people of the town said to the priest, “Why do you sleep with your wife who has leprosy and return next to the eucharistic consecration? What will come of you: this is impure and forbidden by the canons?”</p>
<p>And so the priest stood and took his wife. They went beside abbâ Matthew the patriarch .</p>
<p>The priest said to this man here, “Leprosy came to the groin of this woman, your servant; since the moment I saw that, I have not approached her. Now I have brought her to you so that you may cure her with your holy prayer.”</p>
<p>Abbâ Matthew the patriarch said to him, “My son, have you a subject of hatred against your wife? It is because of that, that you are against her and you say, ‘Leprosy has come upon her.’”</p>
<p>The priest said, “I have no subject of hatred against her, on the contrary I love her as I love myself. Concerning the leprosy which is upon her, if you do not believe me, then look with your eyes at the place where she opens her clothing.”</p>
<p>The patriarch said to him, “Hold yourself, you and your wife, before the icon of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary Mother of God: she will reveal to me if leprosy is upon your wife. As for you, say, ‘Our Father who is in the skies…’.”</p>
<p>They did as he ordered them to do.</p>
<p>The patriarch [he] held himself together with them before the icon, he held his hands and begged Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary Mother of God, by saying, “O my Lady, mother of mercy, cure this woman.”</p>
<p>He plunged his fingers in the oil of the candelabrum which was just to the side of the icon. He placed some secretly from his hand into the clothing of the woman, by the sleeve of his tunic, and anointed the leprous place. </p>
<p>After that, he said to the woman, “uncover your stomach so that your husband may show us the place where you are leprous.”</p>
<p>Abbâ Matthew the patriarch said this, because he knew that she had been purified of her leprosy by the prayer of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary Mother of God. As for that which he had said to the priest – “you have lied concerning the leprosy of your wife” --, (it was sure that) he would not return from the subject of vainglory to this when he had healed her.</p>
<p>When her husband saw, he did not find upon her anything leprous. </p>
<p>He said to the patriarch, “My father, behold that, at the place on her body where leprosy had come, now there is no trace of a leprous place. If you do not believe me, ask her if leprosy has not dwelled upon her: she will not deny it to you.”</p>
<p>Abbâ Matthew the patriarch said to him, “You have lied concerning your wife when you took her in hatred.”</p>
<p>After that, the priest did not respond to him a single word. He took his wife and left there in wonder, praising God and making known the grand actions and wonders of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary Mother of God. He told all of the healing of the leprosy of his wife by the hand of abbâ Matthew the patriarch. [Translation as of 05/21/22]</p>

80,Däbrä Qʷəsqʷam miracles: The monks of Saint Anthony celebrate Holy Week at Däbrä Qʷəsqʷam.,Africa Egypt confirmed (Däbrä Qʷəsqʷam),"<p>In the year 1112 of the era of martyrs,  monks arrived at the monastery of our father Anthony to celebrate the week of the Passion in the monastery of Quesquâm.</p>
<p>There was a bishop by the name of Abbâ Gabriel whom Abbâ Matthew had appointed to Qousyâ; he was holy.</p>
<p>His coming from Cairo took place at that moment. The monks of the monastery of Quesquâm came beside him and said to him, “O our father, celebrate with us the Passion and comfort [réconforte] us so that the poor rejoice.”</p>
<p>He told them yes and went with them on Monday to the monastery of Quesquâm.</p>
<p>Having arrived at the monastery of Quesquâm, he climbed [monta] to the chapel in which had resided Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, with Our Lord Jesus Christ, Joseph the carpenter, and Salomé. He stayed there until Thursday with neither food nor drink.</p>
<p>The abbot of the monastery, by the name of Michael, climbed beside him and said to him, “O our father, descend, do as we have prayed you - which is the washing of feet - and delight the poor.”</p>
<p>The bishop said to him, “I will not descend and will not do anything.”</p>
<p>At this moment, Our Lady, the Holy Twice Virgin Mary the Pure, appeared to him [lui apparut] in the chapel and indicated to him with her hand to descend and to act according to the word of the monks.</p>
<p>So he stood, descended with them, and acted according to their word.</p>
<p>Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, appeared [se montra]  above the tabernacle of the altar and all the people saw her.</p>
<p>She remained visible until the washing of feet was completed. All those who entered to wash their feet prostrated themselves before her.</p>
<p>In effect, there were many people and the clamour of the people was great while they asked for mercy from the Virgin.</p>
<p>That year, all the bovines of the land of Egypt died; there remained only a few.</p>
<p>A Muslim entered the church, running. He stood before Our Lady the Holy Virgin and said, “Our Lady Mary, have pity for the poor, for so it is that their bovines have perished.”</p>
<p>Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, extended her pure hand and made the sign of the cross to the east, the west, the north and the south, all the people who were in the church saw it.</p>
<p>At that moment, the bovine plague ceased in the cultivated country.</p>
<p>Having completed the consecration of the Eucharist on Thursday evening, the bishop Abbâ Gabriel climbed to the chapel and there resided, as previously, until the day of Easter.</p>
<p>The monks went beside him and said to him, “Celebrate the Office for us today and comfort us.”</p>
<p>He said to them, “When the patriarch learns of this after, he will become bitter against me and will say to me, ‘Who permitted you to enter my monastery and to celebrate the Office of your own volition?’”</p>
<p>They said to him, “May all this fall upon us.” They made him descend from there and he celebrated the Office for them.</p>
<p>At the moment of the consecration, Our Lady Mary appeared to him and said to him, “Rejoice, your name was written in the heavens. </p>
<p>“I will take you beside me after the end of the sacrifice and you will inherit eternal life.”</p>
<p>When he had given communion to all the people with the holy mystery, he sent them back in peace and climbed to the place where he had previously been. They [on] brought him a bit of sugar and they gave him drink.</p>
<p>He said to his disciple, “Close the door of the chapel upon me so that I might rest for a little while.”</p>
<p>When the disciple had closed the door upon him and had waited a little while, the priest Michael came and said to him, “Open the door so that we might make our father descend and make him eat a little, for he fasted for a week.”</p>
<p>When the disciple opened the door, he found the bishop prostrated before the icon of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, Mother of God: he was dead in peace.</p>
<p>The abbot of the monastery sounded the bells and assembled the monks. They buried the father bishop and put him underground near the cross.</p>
<p>His tomb is famous and all the people are blessed by it [les gens en sont bénis].</p>
<p>This affair was known in all the regions of Egypt.</p>

<p>He arrived in the cultivated country to take the wheat which had been reserved for the monastery of abbâ Antoine by the sultan of Egypt, according to the custom of each year. He and some monks had arrived in Manfalout, they fell during the festival of our fathers the apostles on the fifth of hamlê. </p>
<p>Jean [he] said to the monks, “Come, let us go and celebrate the festival in the monastery of Quesquâm.”</p>
<p>They arrived there, in that place, three days before the festival.</p>
<p>The next day, an Arab, a mean man of the name of Katib, came and said to the abbot of the monastery Gabriel, “Give me fifty dinars, because a debt of the sultan  weighs on me.”</p>
<p>The abbot of the monastery said to him, “My seigneur, from where would we have gold – we are poor people?”</p>
<p>And so, the Arab stood, struck the abbot in the head with a stick and this man here fell to the ground.</p>
<p>Seeing that, the monks cried and let out cries; it seemed to them that he had immediately died.</p>
<p>And so, the hegumen Jean came out near them and said to the Arab, “Do you not believe in God and do you not have shame before mankind [les hommes], as you act in this way against these poor men?”</p>
<p>Having learned (of this affair?), Jean [he] released him.</p>
<p>The Arab quarreled with the monks and left the monastery in anger. He climbed onto his horse and went away.</p>
<p>While he was going, he met five camels loaded with wheat; he took the camels and also went to the place where the cows of the monastery were. He chose five amongst them who had milk and took them home.</p>
<p>After that, the abbot of the monastery abbâ Gabriel entered beside our father the hegumen and told him about all that the Arab had done.</p>
<p>The abbot [he] said to the hegumen [him], “If Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary Mother of God, is in her chapel, and if she does not make me see a miracle, then death would be better for me. But let us stay awake tonight and beg her to make us see a miracle upon this mean man with a hard heart and very little pity [à la pitié exigue].</p>
<p>All those who were in the monastery went to bed in torment, without dinner. They climbed onto the terrace in order to sleep because of their great anger. They caught sight of a burning fire in the house of the mean man; its [ses] flames did not cease until the morning.</p>
<p>In the morning, one of those who had seen came to the monastery pushing the camels and cows which the mean man had taken. He called the abbot of the monastery Gabriel and greeted him. </p>
<p>The man [he] said to the abbot [him], “Take your camels and your cows, because behold that God killed the mean man by your prayer.”</p>
<p>The abbot said to him, “ What happened?”</p>
<p>The man responded and said to him, “There came a Bedouin while we were sleeping in our homes. There came to us a thought which said, ‘Go and kill your enemy Katib.’ We rose and arrived at the vineyard of that man there. As we did not find him, we seized his servants and said to them, ‘Where is Katib?’ They said to us, ‘He is in his home.’ We lit a fire on the door of his home and the fire burned it, him, his children and his wife. Their number was ten souls. We killed through his relatives eighteen men and pillaged all that there was. The women said to us, ‘These camels and cows are those of the monastery of Quesquâm, he took them and brought them.’ Soon we knew that it was Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, who had incited our hearts to kill him. Here are your cows and your camels. The man himself burned by fire in his home.”</p>
<p>When the monks heard that, they felt a great joy. They praised God and lauded Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary Mother of God. They celebrated a grand festival. </p>

82,Mary restores the strength of an aged priest from Käṭir/Qäṭir from Ǝlkəsus after he was mistreated by a church custodian,Africa Egypt probably,"XX THE VIRGIN MARY AND THE OLD MAN KATIR [A. Fol. 40a, 1; B. Fol. 39b, 1.] NOW there was in a certain city called Elksus a priest who was an old man, and his name was Katir; and he lived in the church of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-bearer. And the verger of the church was an evil-disposed, ill-natured man who said unto Katir in the church, ""Thou dwellest here and dost make offerings for the Eucharist, and thou dost consume whatever offerings are made to the church; get thee gone and remove thyself from the church."" And the priest said unto him, ""O my brother, I am a poor old man, canst thou not see my infirmity? Behold, I have ministered in the church for forty years, and now my strength hath failed me. O my lord, suffer me to abide [here] because of my infirmity."" And the verger of the church was exceedingly angry with him. Then the priest answered and said unto him, ""Have patience with me for three days. The monks of the Monastery of Victor, the son of Hermanos, are coming, and I will ask them to take me away with them."" Now these monks were in the habit of coming to Elksus on the eve of the first day of the week with incense and lights. And when the priest had said these words he wept exceedingly, and said, ""O my holy Lady, thou Virgin Mary, it is now a period of forty years that I have ministered in thy church, and wilt thou forsake me this day?"" And by reason of his abundant weeping he fell asleep. And at midnight our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, appeared unto the verger of the church, and, according to the words of the man himself, there were with her two men who shone with light. And she said unto the verger, ""Hast thou no mercy? What hath this poor priest done unto thee that thou shouldst wish to drive him out of the church, and to send him away?"" Then straightway she commanded one of [the two men] who stood before her to beat the feet of the verger (i.e. to bastinado him), and he did so, and our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, said unto the verger, ""Henceforth thou shalt be a paralytic, and the priest shall be healed."" And it came to pass that when the morning had come the verger of the church was unable [to move], and he could not stand up on his feet; but the aged priest had renewed his strength and had become strong. Now this thing that had come to pass through our Lady Mary was not known until the verger himself declared the matter with his own words. And all the people who saw it marvelled exceedingly, and they ascribed blessings unto our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the Godbearer. So the priest continued to minister in the sanctuary, and the guardian continued to be a paralytic until he died.

At midnight Mary appeared to the verger alongside two radiant men. She commanded one of the men to beat the verger’s feet and paralyze him. In the morning the verger could not stand, but Qätir awoke with renewed strength and vigor. The people marveled at Mary’s miracle.",Nati Arbelaez Solano,,TGS (EOTC) 2014,653,239
83,The story of the two brothers from Dalga in Egypt who were dyers.,Africa Egypt probably,"XXI THE VIRGIN MARY AND TAG AND NAZIB, THE TWO BRETHREN OF DALGA [A. Fol. 42a, 1; B. Fol. 41a, 1.] NOW there were two brethren in a certain city which was called Dalga; one of them was a priest, and his name was Tag, and the other was a deacon, and his name was Nazib. And their handicraft was to dye apparel with indigo colour, and they were good men and kept mercy [in their hearts]. They were wont to bring everyone who came [to visit] the church of Our Holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the Mother of God, which was in that city, to pass the night with them in their house, and they provided him with the evening meal. And it came to pass that one day a certain evil-natured man, a Muhammadan whose name was Akyatar, came to them, and said, “Dye for me these garments and I will give you payment for the same”; and Nazib took the garments from the Muhammadan, and dyed them for him, but he took no payment from him. Then the Muhammadan said to him, “Ye are good Christian men; alas, that ye will not hearken to our Prophet!” And Nazib answered and said to him, “Your Prophet did not come to us that we should listen to him, but our Prophet [Jesus] did come to the Arabs.” Then straightaway the Muhammadan rose up and kissed the head of Nazib, and said to him, “Your testimony is true; our Prophet came only to the Arabs.” And the Muhammadan departed and made an accusation against Nazib to the Kadi, and said to him, “The Christian hath borne testimony that our Prophet came [only] to the Arabs.” Now this he said that Nazib might [be forced] to become a Muhammadan. And straightway the Kadi sent messengers and they brought Nazib to him, and he beat him with many stripes and shut him up in prison. Than Nazib’s brother Tag the priest went into the church and stood up before the picture [or, image] of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, and wept before her, and said, “Behold, O my Lady, I have served thee for a very long time, and if thou wilt not deliver up my brother then take away my life in death, so that I may not be a laughing-stock unto men.” And he slept that night beneath the image of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-bearer, and our holy Lady appeared unto him, and said unto him, “Fear not, neither be thou distressed, for to-morrow morning thy brother shall come unto thee being still a Christian; and I have delivered him over into the care of Mâr George [footnote: Saint George of Cappadocia] of Lydda.” [footnote: A city in Palestine, near Ramleh, also known as Diospolis. This town is famous as the burial-place of the head of Saint George, and traces of the cathedral which the Crusaders built over it in his honour are still to be seen there. The modern name of the city is “Ludd.”] And in that same night Mâr George appeared unto the Kadi with a sharp sword in his hand, and he said unto him, “If thou dost not send back the Christian unto his brother I will cut off thy head.” Then straightway the Kadi awoke from sleep in fear and terror, and he made Nazib to come forth from the prison-house quickly by night, and he said unto him, “Get thee gone to thy brother for the sake of this horseman who appeared unto me holding a sword wherewith to slay me.” And Nazib said unto him, “O my lord, since thou wilt send me away, give me a paper of release written with thine own hand, so that the Muhammadans may not fight against me, and it shall be unto me a witness to them”; and the Kadi gave him a paper of release even as he had said. Now when the morning had come Nazib arrived at the church of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, of which we have already spoken, with the paper of release, and he read it to those who were there. And they ascribed praise unto the glorious and Most High God, and they gave thanks unto our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-bearer, because she had delivered Nazib from the Muhammadans. And his brother Tag celebrated a great festival that day in the name of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the Godbearer. Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933.

d)        <p>Three varied stories on the persecution of the Muslims against Scete (G 59, 104; CR 52, n. 6). </p>
<p>Of the stories on the foundation of Scete I will give below the text of the first concerning  the emperor (of the East) Zeno and the consecration of the church of the Virgin at Scete on the part of the patriarch of Alexandria, Benjamin. </p>
<p>70.</p>
<p>Zeno, Roman Emperor, founded the churches of Scete:</p>
<p>Italian Translation. </p>
<p>        (f. 71 r) When the Lord made the emperor Zeno reign over his countries of Rome and Constantinople and the borders of Egypt, he [Zeno] thought in his heart: “Therefore Constantine, who reigned before me, (built)  Jerusalem, the Sepulcher of Our Lord, and Gethsemane, tomb of Our Lady the doubly-holy Virgin Mary, Mother of God, and Bethlehem and all the Holy places. And he had such beautiful fame forever”.</p>
<p>        Then he heard (Zeno) that in the desert of Scete lived saints, perfect in agony (spiritual) and distinguished for virtue; and which they did not; however, have churches in which to approach the eucharistic sacrifice, which is the flesh and blood of Our Lord. So the Holy Spirit, for the prayers of Our Lady, the doubly-holy Virgin Mary, Mother of God, on the orders of the beloved Son of Her, stimulated the mind of Zeno. And he (Zeno) ordered that they construct  there (in Scete) some churches in the name of Our Lady the doubly-holy Virgin Mary, Mother of God. And he ordered the people of Egypt that they and to their great ones, those who were under his  jurisdiction, that they construct four churches: on in the convent of Saint Macarius; one in that of John the Small; one in the convent  of Bešoy, where that man washed the feet of the Lord; and one in the convent of Moses the Ethiopian, over the cave of Maximus and Domitius. And the Lord revealed innumerable miracles. </p>
<p>        First among all I will tell you, o my brothers, that (which happened) when the church was completed (in the convent) of Saint Macarius in the name of Our Lady the doubly holy Virgin Mary, Mother of God. They had built it very large because it was two hundred cubits high and a hundred cubits broad or more; and they had adorned it with every beautiful ornament which pleases the eyes and gladdens hearts. And painted on the walls the figures of the angels, of the prophets and of the holy apostles and of the martyrs, especially the effigies of Our Lady the doubly-holy Virgin Mary, Mother of God, (effigies) which they adorned with every beautiful ornament. Therefore they called Father  Benjamin, the patriarch of Alexandria, to consecrate it.</p>
<p>When (Benjamin) knew, he rejoiced greatly and he went with the monks until he reached the convent of Saint Macarius. And, when he saw the church, he marveled at the greatness of the Lord and he exalted Him; and he lauded Our Lady the doubly-holy Virgin Mary, Mother of God. They received (in the convent) the monks, four thousand in number. Father Benjamin rejoiced and he blessed them with a great blessing and they celebrated the feast. He (Benjamin) consecrated the church the 8th day of the month of terr, on Sunday. And while he consecrated and marked with a cross****  with the sacred crism which is the seal of Christianity, he saw Our Lord Jesus Christ who marked contemporaneously to him with his holy hand at the same time with His holy angels and his mother, Our Lady the doubly-holy Virgin Mary. And, having seen this, he was amazed (Benjamin) and he was taken by fear and terror and he said: “In truth this is the house of God and the door of heaven!”. Then he heard a voice which said: “Do not be afraid, oh Benjamin! Like you said, this is the house of God and the door of heaven! And write of your hand a writing so that they may not enter into this house neither the vain or the proud nor those who are ordained for simony, but only those who are ordained rightly among the priests and deacons!”. And, while Father Benjamin was around the church, he saw in spirit Our Father Father Macarius with all the saints and he said in his heart: “In truth that man was frightened of God; and if God is willing, he will name him a bishop!” And a cherub replied to him that he was with him: “This man is father Macarius, father of the patriarchs and of the bishops and of the monks!”. [And when] Father Benjamin [understood] these words, he prostrated himself before the saints and had their blessing and he exalted Our Lady the doubly-holy Virgin Mary, Mother of God. </p>

<p>The Other Stories On the Foundation of Scete and Emperor Zeno.</p>
<p>Saint Macarius the Great.</p>
<p>        G 87 continues the narrative of G 86.  One day one  of the priests made the solemn journey of the church incensing (in the  convent of  Saint Macarius).He came before the effigy of the Virgin, he stopped to venerate her. The icon spoke saying “Do not hurry!” The priest places   his hand on a column and a trace of the hand remains there, always visible.</p>
<p>        The patriarch Benjamin performs the rites, he celebrates in Scetis the feast of the Epiphany bathing in the stream which was prodigiously found and which had the name of Jordan.  Then he returns to Alexandria where he writes to the Emperor Zeno telling him [about] the wonders of Scetis. The daughter of Zeno, Ilaria, therefore leaves the court and comes to Scetis to live in a monastery. Zeno then provides that annuities are granted to the convents and to the churches of Scetis for their maintenance and for the sustenance of the monks.</p>
<p>        G 88 Tells how the Virgin, during the flight to Egypt, stopped in Metmāq. She blessed that place and the prodigious spring gushed there. From Metmāq the Holy Family went to the great town of Egypt which is called Cairo . On the road the Virgin turns to the east, she sees the desert of Scetis and she blesses it. The Child agrees and announces that there will go blessed men similar to the angels and that “this desert will be your share, o My Mother!” , because those who will live here will be particularly devoted to the Virgin.</p>
<p>        A bit later, after the apostles had announced the Gospel, the Lord appeared to  an Egyptian of the name Abraham, who lived near Scetis, and he said to him: “I chose you, like the first Abraham, to sow the seed  of  generations and generations of my people.” The wife of Abraham was with child and gave birth to a son who was given the name Macarius. Macarius then became a deacon; the parents gave him a wife, but he keeps himself pure in his virginity. So he goes with permission of his father to buy salt with camels in the desert of Scetis. While he sleeps in the desert an angel appears to him, who he carries on one shoulder and shows him the extent of Scetis, foretelling the glorious future of that desert. The parents and wife of Macarius died. He remains alone and his villagers bring it to the bishop, that he consecrate the priest. At the Elevation, during the mass, he was snatched by an angel who took him back to Scetis, where the other worshippers reached him.</p>
<p>        So Macarius goes to Saint Antonio, who blesses him and gives him a monk’s habit. During the sight/vision, Saint Antonio dies prophesying to Macarius the shining future of Scetis. Macarius returned to Scetis; the monks increased to five thousand. At one hundred and ten years Macarius, after he had seen his greatest disciples John Colobos, Bešoy, Moses the Ethiopian, Maximus and Domitius, he dies in peace.[Translation as of 05/21/22]</p>

After Zeno became emperor of Rome, Constantinople, and the borders of Egypt, he contemplated the many famous structures Constantine had built in Jerusalem. Zeno then learned that many distinguished saints lived in the desert of Scete, but that no churches existed there. Spurred by the Holy Spirit, Zeno ordered that four churches be built in the name of the Virgin Mary. One of the churches was constructed in the convent of Saint Macarius |sp|. This large church was adorned with beautiful ornaments, had an icon of the Virgin Mary, and featured elaborately painted walls. Abbâ Benjamin, the patriarch of Alexandria, was called to consecrate the church, which he did on the eighth day of Ṭərr |sp|, a Sunday. As he made the sign of the Cross with the chrism, Abbâ Benjamin saw a vision of Jesus Christ, the Virgin Mary, and the angels, all making the sign of the Cross as well. The vision startled Abbâ Benjamin, but a voice told him not to fear. Abbâ Benjamin then a vision of a holy man in the church, and an angel identified the man as Saint Macarius. Abbâ Benjamin prostrated before the saint and exalted the Virgin Mary. II. One day a priest traveled to the church built in the convent of Saint Macarius. The priest went before the icon of the Virgin Mary, and the icon spoke to him, saying: “Do not hurry!” The priest placed his hand on a column, and an outline of his handprint remained visible there ever after. Abbâ Benjamin performed rites for the feast of the Epiphany. Then he returned to Alexandria and wrote to Emperor Zeno, telling him of the wonders he had seen in Scete.

She blessed this land as well, and her Son said that those who lived in the desert would be particularly devoted to her. Later, Jesus appeared before Abraham, who lived near Scete, and informed him that he had been chosen to sow the seed of generations. Abraham’s wife became pregnant and gave birth to a son named Macarius. Macarius became a deacon, and though his parents gave him a wife, he chose to remain a virgin. One day he went into the desert of Scete to buy salt, and while he slept there an angel visited him and told him of the desert’s great future. Later, while Macarius was giving mass, an angel came and carried him away to Scete. After that, Macarius went to Saint Anthony, who blessed him and told him a prophecy about Scete’s future. Macarius then returned to Scete and remained there. By the time he died, at one hundred ten years old, five thousand monks lived in the desert.

After Zeno became emperor of Rome, Constantinople, and the borders of Egypt, he contemplated the many famous structures Constantine had built in Jerusalem. Zeno then learned that many distinguished saints lived in the desert of Scete, but that no churches existed there. Spurred by the Holy Spirit, Zeno ordered that four churches be built in the name of the Virgin Mary. One of the churches was constructed in the convent of Saint Macarius |sp|. This large church was adorned with beautiful ornaments, had an icon of the Virgin Mary, and featured elaborately painted walls. Abbâ Benjamin, the patriarch of Alexandria, was called to consecrate the church, which he did on the eighth day of Ṭərr |sp|, a Sunday. As he made the sign of the Cross with the chrism, Abbâ Benjamin saw a vision of Jesus Christ, the Virgin Mary, and the angels, all making the sign of the Cross as well. The vision startled Abbâ Benjamin, but a voice told him not to fear. Abbâ Benjamin then a vision of a holy man in the church, and an angel identified the man as Saint Macarius. Abbâ Benjamin prostrated before the saint and exalted the Virgin Mary.

One day a priest traveled to the church built in the convent of Saint Macarius. The priest went before the icon of the Virgin Mary, and the icon spoke to him, saying: “Do not hurry!” The priest placed his hand on a column, and an outline of his handprint remained visible there ever after. Abbâ Benjamin performed rites for the feast of the Epiphany. Then he returned to Alexandria and wrote to Emperor Zeno, telling him of the wonders he had seen in Scete. Upon hearing Abbâ Benjamin’s news, Zeno’s daughter, Ilaria, left court and went to live in a monastery in the desert. From then on, Zeno granted annuities to maintain the monasteries and churches of Scete, and to provide sustenance for the monks who lived there.

<p>There was a monk named Absadi among Shenute’s followers who tended the plants of the vegetable garden  of the brothers. And he charitably gave the produce  of the vegetable garden to any of the brothers who came to him.  </p>
<p>But [the other] brothers reported him to the elder [Shenute], saying that, “As for Absadi, he never leaves any produce in the vegetable garden because he gives [all of it] to the brothers who come to him.”  </p>
<p>And Abba Shenute replied to them, “It is not a sin for Absadi to give charity.  In fact, God’s blessing is with him.”  </p>
<p>And on that night, the elder [Shenute] slept for a little while and saw a very beautiful woman whose entire body shone with the light of the Lord. Behold, she held the hand of [a man whom the elder did not recognize but who was] Absadi. </p>
<p>She said to Absadi, “Don’t be afraid and don’t cease giving charity from the produce of the vegetable garden because it doesn’t belong to you. Rather, it belongs to God. The heart of my son and lord is delighted with you due to your giving charity from the fresh plants of the vegetable garden to the brothers and to all who need it.”  </p>
<p>And as for Saint Abba Shenute, when he heard what the woman said to [the man, who was] Absadi, he realized that she was our lady, the Pure Virgin, the Mother of Our Lord, the Mother of the Mighty First [or, Preexisting] Word, he about whom it is said has no beginning, creator of all creation with his mighty ability. </p>
<p>And she returned to the holy elder again [in another dream] and said to him, “Dear Shenute, beloved of my son, that was Absadi, the one whom the brothers reported to you. I will bring him to the church and you will find him there.” </p>
<p>And when they sounded the call to prayer of the church, Abba Shenute entered before everyone else, and he saw [a man, whom he didn’t know was] Absadi standing alone while praying. And his ten fingers were like ten burning candles. </p>
<p>Abba Shenute said, “Who are you, [looking] like this?” </p>
<p>And he replied, “My dear father, I am Absadi, your son.” </p>
<p>And the elder said, “Who brought you here, my dear son?” </p>
<p>And Absadi replied, “The one who came to you inside your house [during your dream], the one who spoke to you before the sounding of the call of prayer--it is that one who brought me here.”  </p>
<p>And the elder said, “Behold, I know that God is with you, in all that you do, and I will come to you today in the vegetable garden so that I may visit you. Yet, my dear son, don’t cease doing your charity, according to your habit, in the name of Mary.” </p>
<p>And the elder went to him at the third hour of the day [that is, 9:00 am] and he saw Absadi working in the vegetable garden of the brothers.  </p>
<p>And again he saw the Holy Virgin, Mary, the pure mother of the savior of the entire world. And she lifted Absadi’s hands, placed them in the water [trough] of the vegetable garden, and [using his hands] she sprinkled [the water] over all the plants.  </p>
<p>And she said, “Sprout, become big, and tower upwards. Don’t be late!” Then, she bid Absadi farewell and left him in great splendor.  </p>
<p>May her prayer and petition be with our king Zara Yacob forever and ever, amen! </p>

97,The wrath of Saint Mary against the prefect of a church who tried to stop the priests from making a procession while singing hymns to her.,,"<p>There were two close friends. One of them presided over a church. When he who presided over the church saw the priest wanted to taking a turn [faire le tour] around the church while chanting the praises of Our Lady at the top of their voices [à pleine voix], on the day of her festival, he wanted to prevent them from taking a turn around the church; he thought and said, “Because of the overabundance of  hymns, the moment of the Eucharist will be passed [sera passé].”</p>
<p>At that moment came into his heart, with fear and trembling, a thought that said, “Do not prevent them from taking a turn around the church while chanting the praises of Our Lady Mary, out of fear that your Lady, mother of your Lord, may be irritated with you.”</p>
<p>He said also to his friend who was with him, “Would my Lady Mary be irritated with me because of this affair? Indeed, many times I prevented the priests from taking a turn around the church while chanting the praises of Our Lady: I was wary of that which (the moment of) the Eucharist would not pass.</p>
<p>His friend said to him, “Me too, I will speak with you with indubitable words of the praises of Our Lady Mary and of her glorious chant.</p>
<p>“This was while I was in a monastery where I had not made myself a monk. The priests began to burst into the praises of Our Lady Mary at the top of their voices </p>
<p>“When the abbot heard the din of the voices of the priests, he raised his baton and made them cease the chant of Our Lady Mary.</p>
<p>“A solitary one of the name Étienne said to him, ‘You, Our Lady Mary made you drop from your seat and removed you from your duty, because you made her chant cease.’</p>
<p>“The superior abandoned his duty while no one forced him nor deprived him of his power. When he had abandoned his duty, the priests and the monks began to beg him, saying, ‘Why do you abandon your duty while no one forces you, and why do you reject us while we have not acted unjustly towards you?’</p>
<p>“They stayed to beg him for three days to not abandon his duty, but they could not make him agree to it. At the end of three days, all the monks and the priests of the monastery assembled in the church. He himself entered with them. </p>
<p>“When the deacon brought the Eucharistic bread to the altar, the monks said to the superior, “We leave it to the body and blood of Christ so that you do not reject us, and do not abandon your duty.</p>
<p> “He said to them, ‘Even if you (threatened to) cut my neck with the sword, I would (not) return to this duty.’</p>
<p>“When he refused them, they nominated another in his place and (thus) was accomplished that which had been said to him by Étienne the solitary one: ‘Our Lady Mary made you drop from your duty because you made her chant cease.’” [Translation as of 05/21/22]</p>

98,Saint Basil and the Icon cycle: The proud men who wanted to have a splendid icon of Saint Mary made.,,"LXX THE VIRGIN MARY AND HER PORTRAIT ON A SAPPHIRE TABLET [Brit. Mus. MS. Orient. No. 652. Fol. 105a, No. 83.] THERE were certain men of arrogant minds who wanted to have sculptured a figure of our Lady Mary, the enemy of the arrogant, and they gave a fine stone to the stonecutter, and they prepared for it gold wherein to set the stone, and they commanded him to engrave for them a picture of our Lady Mary upon a tablet of sapphire plated (or, framed) with gold. Now they wished the work to be of the finest—though their heart was not good—but not because it was what our Lady expected, for they only worked for their own glorification. And our Lady Mary, the enemy of the arrogant, who loveth those who love her in righteous ness, appeared unto the cutter of the picture whilst he was asleep by night, and she said unto him, ""Take good heed to thyself that thou prayest not for these erring folk, for they wish to have a picture of me cut for ostentation, and not for reverent dedication. Their offering is not pleasing unto me, even as David my father saith, Let not the oil of the sinful anoint my head.""1 And she also appeared unto Abba Basil, and she said unto him, ""Come, and I will show thee my picture which hath been painted by the hand of the angels. It is in a holy and secret place, and it is a healing for those who recite salutations to it, and it straighteneth the feet of the lame, and it bestoweth light upon the blind, and it maketh whole those who suffer from leprosy and wounds."" And the Archbishop Basil awoke from his sleep and was perturbed because of the vision that he had seen of our Lady Mary appearing to him. And in the morning he set out with bishops, and priests, and deacons carrying censers and the cross, singing praises to God and His virgin mother, and when they had arrived at the place which our Lady Mary had told him about, they found the marks. And the Archbishop commanded the people to dig, and the bishops went round censing the place, and the deacons sang psalms and hymns. And whilst they were praying and digging, they came across a red tablet that resembled coal and on it was painted a picture of our Lady Mary with her Son, and olive oil dripped from that picture. And when those who were present saw this they rejoiced exceedingly, and the Archbishop placed the tablet in the church by the seat of the people, so that all those who believed in her prayer might salute her, and they decorated her with her tiara and her draperies. And all those who were sick and who saluted her were healed of their sickness, of whatsoever kind it was, and the lepers were cleansed as soon as they were anointed with the oil that flowed from the tablet, and great miracles took place. And there was a certain woman who had killed her sister by giving her a draught of deadly poison, because she was jealous of her for having slept with her husband. And one day this murderess came with the other people to salute the Virgin and to be anointed with the olive oil that came from her, and straightway leprosy seized her, and her flesh became white like marble, and all those who saw her marvelled and were astonished. And they asked her, saying, ""O woman, what hast thou done that maketh this kind of thing to appear on thee?"" And there was great awe that day because of that miracle and wonder at what our Lady Mary had done, and no man made an offering to that picture. Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933.

The next morning the archbishop and his followers went to the location Mary had described. There they found a red tablet that was dripping with olive oil, and which bore Mary’s image. The archbishop rejoiced and had the tablet installed in his church. The oil healed the maladies of anyone anointed with it. One day a woman who had killed her sister for being unfaithful with her husband came to the church. When she was anointed with the oil, her skin immediately turned white with leprosy. People marveled at the incident and never again made offerings to the painting.",Nati Arbelaez Solano,,#N/A,#N/A,91
99,"The stone-footed man (i. e., a man with gout) from France.",Europe confirmed (France),"XXII THE VIRGIN MARY AND THE LAME MAN [A. Fol. 44b, 1; B. Fol. 43a, 1.] NOW there was a man in a certain city of the Franks (i.e. in Europe) who had a lame foot, and he used to cover up his foot with cloth so that people might not know [that he was lame]; and he continued to weep and lament day and night without ceasing. And he loved to betake himself early in the morning to the church of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-bearer, which was in that city and which was decorated with gold and silver, and precious stones, and hyacinthine stone. And it came to pass one day that a great multitude of people were gathered together in that church, and the man who had a lame foot came also with them. And as they were going out, the Arch bishop came and found him near the entrance (?) of the church, and he was angry and said, ""Who hath been into this church?"" And he said unto the people, ""Come back, all of you, and do not depart""; and they all returned. Then again the Archbishop said unto them, ""Get ye out, one at a time""; and the people did as he had commanded them. And it came to pass that when the people had gone out one by one, the man with the lame foot was the only person left there. And he prostrated himself before the picture (or, image) of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, and tears flowed from his eyes, and he wept with a bitter weeping; and straightway his lame foot was loosed, and he became whole like the [other] men. Now when the people saw him they were amazed and held their peace. And the Archbishop beckoned to the man [to come to him], and said unto him, ""How long hadst thou been in that state?"" And the man replied, ""From the time that I came forth from my mother's womb my foot was in that state, and I used to wrap it up in linen that the people might not know [that I was lame]; and I used to weep by day and by night, and I made supplication unto our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, unceasingly. When I came into the church this day thou wast angry with all [the people] because of my sin, and thou didst say unto them, 'Go forth one by one,' and they came back; and the lot went forth for me and I alone was left [there]. Then straightway I bowed down before the picture of our Lady, and I wept much, and forth with my foot was loosed."" Now when the Archbishop heard him he found the matter hard to understand. And he and all the people went and prostrated themselves before the picture of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-bearer, and he ascribed praise unto God, the Glorious and Most High God, and rendered thanksgiving unto our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-bearer, who hath the power to do all things, to whom nothing is impossible, and who worketh wonders and miracles. When the man of the Franks committed himself to thy protection, Thou didst make whole his foot which was lame. O Mary, when I offer up unto thee the Offering, In my joy mingle thou not sorrow therewith, As men mingle water with the wine. Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933.

Mus. MS. Orient. No. 652. Fol. 110a, No. 87.] AND it came to pass that, after our Lady Mary had brought forth her beloved Son Jesus Christ, and whilst they were living in Bethlehem, Herod the king commanded [his men] to slay all the male children. And when His mother heard this she fled with the Child to the land of Egypt. And as she was journeying along thither the tribulations of the way came upon her, the heat of the sun, the cold of night, and hunger and thirst. And thirst which it is hard to describe seized her, and she asked Him, saying, ""O Lord of all creation, Thou fruit of my womb, I am exceedingly thirsty, give me water to drink just as Thou didst give Thy people water to drink by making it to flow from the rocks. If Thou wert not the King then the Wise Men would not have brought gold to present unto Thee, and the men of Persia would not have brought incense, and they would never have come to worship Thee if the star had not guided them."" And thus saying, she lifted Him up on her shoulders, and by His Godhead He brought forth water of the Garden (i.e. Paradise) which was as white as milk, and it flowed up about her feet and lapped them ; and when she saw this she gave thanks to the Holy Trinity. And after this our Lady Mary drank, and Joseph and Salome drank. And the Child said, ""This water is established until I come in My glory""; but only His mother heard these words. And after they had drunk they rested a little. And the daughter of a thief, who was blind and leprous, came along the road, and mercy drew her, and she put her foot in the water, and she speedily saw the light and was cleansed of her leprosy, and she saw our Lady Mary with the Child and with Joseph and Salome. And she said unto them, ""Who are you?"" And Mary said unto her, ""I am Mary, and [this is] my Son Jesus Christ."" And the daughter of the thief said unto her, ""I believe in thy Son Jesus Christ, and in thy prayer""; and thus saying she worshipped her, and then she returned to her house. And when the men of the city saw her they were astonished, and they said unto her, ""Who healed thee?"" And her brother Yoset also asked her, and she told him, and he said, ""Yesterday I met them on the road, and I took away the Child from His mother, and the odour of His apparel scented me like the odour of sovereignty, and it was diffused in my garments, and to-day the sweet odour of His perfume is fixed therein."" It was this thief who devoured eight and seventy souls, and he, Yoset, was the thief on the right hand. They had the same father and the same mother, and Mary, of the sweet unguent, was their father's sister. And it came to pass after the death of our Lady Mary that the second thief, after slaying and shedding blood, came to that water that sprang up under the feet of our Lady Mary. And he washed away the sweat [caused by] the sun, and he drank, and the water washed over the stone under his head and his sword and his spear, and he fell asleep. And the other thief came to wash there, and when he saw his companion asleep, he took up his sword and cut off his head and he died straight way. And the angels of darkness came and carried him away, shaking his soul as they went. And our Lady Mary came and said, ""This soul belongeth to me""; and the angels of darkness said unto her, ""He neither spared the righteous nor the rich."" And our Lady Mary went and bowed down before our Lord and said unto Him, ""Have mercy upon me, my Son, have mercy upon me."" And our Lord said unto her, ""Mercy is not fitting for him that is drenched in the blood of men."" And our Lady Mary said, ""He who hath washed in the water of the Garden which Thou didst make to spring up hath come to Thee."" And the Lord said unto her, ""For him who hath washed in the water of the Garden which I made to spring up under thy feet the punishment of death is not seemly. Let them wash him again in the water of life and bring him into the Garden (i.e. Paradise)."" And the hosts of angels prostrated themselves, saying, ""Glory be to God Who hath pleasure in man."" And it came to pass that after our Lord Jesus Christ had ascended into heaven, the thief who had killed his companion came and fell asleep in that water of the Garden, and his wish was to be washed therein. And another thief came and saw the chief of the thieves washing, and he said in his heart, ""I will kill my companion on the road, and will cut off his shoulder whilst he is washing."" And as he meditated thus, the thief turned his face and looked at him, and saw him with his head cloth stripped off him. And he ran like a stag, and seized him, and killed him, and returned to the water, and washed again and drank. And he said in his heart, ""This is the water which healed my mother long ago, and cleansed her leprosy, and removed the darkness of her eyes. And now I myself will believe in the prayer of Mary."" And having said this, he set himself by the side of the water, and he placed his spear and his sword under his head and fell asleep. And the daughter of the thieves came to that water that had sprung up under the feet of our Lady Mary—now she was ugly of face, and the form of her body was emaciated, and she was weak and infirm—and she looked at the chief of the thieves lying asleep, and she drew out his sword from his belt and cut off his head. And the hand of God was upon her supporting her, and she remembered what Isaiah, the beloved prophet, had said, ""Blood shall not be cleansed except by blood."" And the other thief came and saw that murderess; and standing afar off he transfixed her with his spear, and she died, and she was made innocent at the water by which she had slain the chief of the thieves, who had never shown mercy on anyone. And quickly came the frightful and terrifying angels of darkness, and they carried away his soul and shook it in a way that ten men could not describe, and they brought it into the third heaven. And our Lady Mary came and said, ""This soul belongeth to me""; and those angels of darkness said unto her, ""There is no man under heaven who hath committed sin as this man hath done."" And our Lady Mary went to our Lord Jesus Christ, and bowed low before Him, saying, ""Have mercy upon me, O fruit of my womb""; and our Lord answered His mother never a word because of the great sin of that man. And again she bowed low before Him, saying, ""Have mercy upon me, O my Son, Whose word can never be made a lie""; and the Lord spake not to her. And she bowed low the third time, saying, ""O Thou Whose word cannot be made a lie, have mercy upon me. He said, I believe in the prayer of Mary, and fell asleep."" And our Lord Jesus Christ said unto her, ""Him who hath remembered thee and invoked thy name, whether he be a righteous man or whether he be a sinner, I will have mercy on him."" And thus saying He had mercy upon him and said, ""Wash him in the water of life, and bring him into the Garden."" O our Lady Mary, may thy prayer and thy petition be with us for ever. Budge, E. A.

Fol. 44b, 1.] NOW there was a certain bishop whose name was Mercurius, and his whole body was covered with leprosy. And one day he went unto the Archbishop Zacharias, and when the Archbishop saw him, he touched him and said unto him gently and graciously, ""O my brother, it is not seemly for thee to minister as a priest with this disease upon thee, unless our Lord Jesus Christ remove it from thee—for the Book calleth a man with leprosy unclean"" (Leviticus xiii. 44, 45). And when Bishop Mercurius heard him he wept much, and said unto him, ""O my father, help me with thy prayers."" Then he departed from him, and went and entered into the church unto which he had been ap pointed, and he stood up before the picture of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-bearer, and he wept, and made supplication unto her that she would cleanse him of his leprosy. And this he continued to do from the morning of the second day of the week until the ninth hour of the fourth day of the week, and he prayed many prayers unceasingly. Now at the time of the ninth hour of the fourth day of the week he became wearied, and he placed his head in a position of rest, and as he was resting he straightway fell asleep. And he saw in a dream that the hand of the picture (or, image) of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, reached out and rubbed his flesh. And he awoke immediately, and found that his body had been cleansed from his leprosy, and he rejoiced with great joy, and praised God, the Glorious and Most High God, and made thanksgiving unto our Lady, the twofold Virgin, Mary, the Godbearer, because she had graciously vouchsafed unto him mercy. Thou didst cleanse Mercurius from his leprosy, And didst heal him completely of the disease that consumed him. O Mary, fill thou my feeble mind with thyself, That I may not forget the admonitions of thy Son, the Teacher of the Law, Even as one who looketh at himself in a mirror. Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933.

106,The rich man who threw dry bread to a beggar in the name of Saint Mary.,Africa probably,"LXXXVI THE VIRGIN MARY AND THE RICH MAN WHO CAST A LOAF TO A BEGGAR [Brit. Mus. MS. Orient. No. 652. Fol. 4b.] THERE was a man in a certain city who was very rich, and he celebrated the commemoration of our Lady, the Virgin Mary, and he used to attend the Eucharist on her days [of festival]. He did nothing else which was good, for he neither gave alms nor had com passion on the poor, and he was ill-tempered towards his slaves. And one day, that is to say, the 21st day of Ter, he went to attend the Eucharist, and when he was going out he said unto his servants, ""Make ready for me the upper storey, lay down carpets, and decorate it with linen draperies""; and they did so. And when he went up to the upper floor they brought to him meats and drinks of every kind, and he ate. And before he had satisfied his hunger and filled his belly, a poor man, a hungry beggar, cried out under the window, saying, ""Have pity upon me, master, for I am very hungry."" And the rich man took up a dry loaf of bread and in a rage threw it to him, saying, ""Take this, then, for the sake of Mary's name."" And the loaf split the beggar's head open, and the blood ran down over his face, but the beggar did not feel the blood because of the keen ness of his hunger, and he departed thanking the rich man, and he hurried off to a place which otherwise he could not have reached. Hearken now, O my brethren. Before this rich man had finished his meal he died suddenly, and his wife and children wept for him. And the angels came and took him before God, and our Lady the Virgin Mary came straightway that she might hear the judgement. And God said, ""Take this soul into Sheol."" And our Lady the Virgin Mary said, ""This soul is mine""; and God said, ""What hath it done for thee?"" And she said, ""This day he satisfied a beggar with food for my name's sake."" And God said unto her, ""What did he give him? Was it not blood?"" And our Lady said, ""Command them to bring this beggar here."" And straightway they brought him there, and when the beggar saw the rich man, he said, ""O thou who didst fill me with food for Mary's name's sake, have they brought thee hither?"" And God said unto the beggar, ""What did he give thee? Was it not blood?"" And the beggar said, ""I did not feel the blood."" And God said, ""Let the soul return to its body""; and straightway our Lady Queen Mary and the angels bowed down and wor shipped.

107,"The story of the penitent harlot, Mary of Egypt (d. 421)",Africa Egypt confirmed,"LXXV THE VIRGIN MARY, AND MARY THE EGYPTIAN HARLOT [Brit. Mus. MS. Orient. No. 652. Fol. 119a, No. 100.] NOW there was a certain Egyptian woman whose name was Mary, and this holy woman was a native of Egypt and came from Alexandria, and her parents were Christians. And when she was twelve years old, the Enemy of the human race led her astray, and seduced her, and made her his net wherein he snared an innumerable number of souls. And she gave her body to harlotry without payment, because of her love of this destroying sin. And she lived this life of defilement for sixteen years. And God, the lover of the race of men, caused her to see certain men who wished to travel to the city of Jerusalem in order to be blessed there at the tomb of our Lord Jesus Christ, and she was moved in her mind to go with them. And she embarked in a ship together with many people, and the sailors said unto her, ""Pay us the hire of the ship."" Now she had no money to give them, so she gave herself over to them that they might commit fornication with her, in lieu of the hire of the ship. And when she came to the city of Jerusalem she did the same thing, and she committed fornication continually. And whensoever she wished to enter the door of the tomb of our Lord Jesus Christ, the power of the Divinity prevented her from going in; and although she tried to enter several times she was unable to do so, and she concluded that it was her filthy sin that prevented her entrance. And being sad and sorrowful she lifted up her eyes to heaven, and she saw a picture of our Lady Mary, and she wept before it, and made supplication, saying, ""O Intercessor for all Christian people, O Mother of God, take me into thy keeping. Since I came [here] I have wished to celebrate thy festival like all other people: I will do what thou commandest me."" And when she had said these words, weeping as she said them, she passed in quickly into the church of the tomb of our Lord Jesus Christ. And when she had celebrated the festival, she went back to the picture of our Lady Mary, and she prayed a long prayer 'before it, and she shed bitter tears, and she entreated her to send her to any place she wished so that she might save her soul. And a voice came forth from the picture, which said, ""If thou wilt go into the desert of Jordan thou shalt find rest and salvation."" And she accepted that advice, and prayed at the picture of our Lady Mary, and departed. And as she was going out she met a certain man who gave her one hundred pieces of small brass money, and with them she bought bread. And she crossed the river Jordan and dwelt there for seven and thirty years, fighting a great spiritual fight, and Satan waged war against her by means of the filthy lust which she had in the days gone by when he toiled therein. And she used to fast every ten days and every ten nights, and she pleased our Lady Mary, and she died in peace. And after she died Zosimus the priest found a written roll placed under her head, saying, ""Bury poor Mary in the dust from which she was taken."" And he saw at her feet a lion guarding her. And he wondered, saying, ""With what shall I dig her grave?"" And the lion came and dug the grave, and Zosimus buried her.

108-A,"Patriarch Abraham of Alexandria (d. 978), King al-Muizz, and the parable of the mustard seed (whole or opening)",Africa Egypt confirmed,"<p>[In History of the Patriarchs of Alexandria by Severus, according to Wikipedia]</p>
<p>This happened just [encore] in the days of the illustrious father, the Patriarch Abraham of Alexandria [TGS says Abba Ephrem, due to the Syrian, but not correct].</p>
<p>There was a king who reigned in Egypt who called himself Mouizz [Abu Tamim Ma'ad al-Muizz li-Din Allah]. He had a general who was Jewish, this one here entered in the law of the Muslims and became like them.</p>
<p>This general had a Jewish friend. This one here would enter with him, at all moments, beside the king, and would talk with the king.</p>
<p>This Jew, when he had found the favor beside the king thanks to his friend the general, expressed a wish beside the king and said to him, “I pray you, o king, to make come the patriarch so that I may compete [dispute] with him before you.”</p>
<p>The king sent a messenger and made come this father; with him was abbâ Sévère Ibn-el-Moqaffa, bishop of the city of Echmouneïn.</p>
<p>They competed [disputèrent] with the Jew, defeated him and thwarted [confondirent] him.</p>
<p>When the king saw that, he rejoiced and gave great honors to the patriarch and those who were with him.</p>
<p>They returned to their homes in peace.</p>
<p>The general was discomfited.</p>
<p>The Jew would seek each day the downfall of the patriarch and all the people of the Christians.</p>
<p>One day, the general entered beside the king and said to him, “These Christians do not have faith. Indeed, it is said in their Gospel: If you have faith like a grain of mustard, you will say to this mountain: Pass and fall into the ocean, that will happen for you .”</p>
<p>When the king heard these words, he sent messengers and made come the patriarch abbâ Ephrem; the king said to him, “What say you concerning these words and concerning your Gospel which says, If you have faith like a grain of mustard, you will say to this mountain: Pass and it  will pass?”</p>
<p>The patriarch said, “Yes, in truth, so says the Holy Gospel.”</p>
<p>The king said, “Behold that you are myriads and myriads of myriads who have faith. I want you to bring me one among you so that he may demonstrate this miracle by his hands. </p>
<p>When the patriarch heard that, he trembled and was very afraid.</p>
<p>He said to the king, “Wait three days for my consideration.”</p>
<p>The king said to him, “May it be as you have said.”</p>
<p>The patriarch left from before the king. He gathered the bishops and monks who were close to him. They stayed in the church of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, Moallaqâ of Cairo, for three days and three nights, standing, praying and begging God.</p>
<p>When it was the third day, in the morning, Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary Mother of God, came and appeared to them with a serene and joyous face. </p>
<p>She said to the bishop, “What has happened to you?”</p>
<p>He responded and said to her, “You know well, o my Lady, what has happened to me.”</p>
<p>She said to him, “Do not be afraid, because behold that I have accepted your request and the tears that you have shed in my church. Now, stand and go to the place of the door of iron that leads to the market; you will find a man who carries a pitcher of water on his shoulders, he has a sole eye: he will demonstrate for you this miracle. The name of this man is ‘Simon he who sews the sandals.’ Indeed, he removed his eye by the order of my beloved Son .”</p>
<p>Now listen, my brothers, of “the order of my Son” of which Our Lady Mary spoke concerning this man: I will narrate to you that which I have heard.</p>
<p>In those days, there was a prostitute who was a daughter of Satan. She would take in her snare numerous men by the desire corrupted by lust.</p>
<p>One day, the enemy of good compelled her and she arrived beside this holy Simon (who later became) a monk. She found him sitting, sewing sandals according to his custom; she stood before him and said to him, “Make me sandals in the size of my foot.”</p>
<p>And she opened her clothes to show him her sandals.</p>
<p>She lifted again her clothes up to her knees to show her the snugness of her flesh and to make him fall in the desire of lust, as the devil had taught her.</p>
<p>When the happy Simon the monk recalled that which Our Lord said in the Gospel, “If your right eye seduces you, tear it out, remove it,and throw it on the ground”, etc., he punctured (?)his eye with an awl. Under the violence of pain, he fell to the ground. </p>
<p>Because of that, Our Lady Mary said to the patriarch, “He is a man who removed his eye because of the command of my beloved Son.”</p>
<p>After that, the patriarch stood, went quickly and found the man. He said to him, “Have pity for the people of the Christians.”</p>
<p>The patriarch told him how Our Lady had appeared to him, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary Mother of God, and how she had spoken about him.</p>
<p>The man prostrated himself while saying, “Pardon me, o my father, because I am a sinner and guilty and I am not capable of that which you have said to me. But may the will of God come, and may the prayer of Our Lady Mary the Twice-Virgin be fulfilled, and may your prayer aid the people of the Christians. I only ask you, o my father, to not reveal my action to anyone, because I do not have the capacity of carrying the glory of this world. Do what I will tell you. Depart to the mountain which I will tell you, with the king, with the priests and also your people, and the Gospels, the crosses, the censers and the candles. May the king, his troops and all his people hold themselves on the same side. I, you, and your people, on the same side. Me, I will hold myself behind you, among your people, and no one will recognize me. Beg God, cry out and say “Kyrie eleison”forty-one times. After that, command the people to be quiet and prostrate themselves with you. Act again in this way three times while making the sign of the life-giving Cross, in the face of the mountain.”</p>
<p>When the patriarch heard this, he took the bishops, the priests, the monks, the people and the believes and arrived beside the king. </p>
<p>The king went out, with him were his troops and all the people of Cairo; they went near the mountain.</p>
<p>The patriarch abbâ Ephrem and the believers held themselves on one side.</p>
<p>The king, his troops and all the people of his house held themselves on the other side.</p>
<p>Next, the patriarch and the believers prayed, and also Simon the monk with them; they prayed, saying, “Lord, have pity for us” for a long moment.</p>
<p>Next, they prostrated themselves three times. Each time they prostrated themselves, the father patriarch would raise his eyes toward the sky and make the sign of the cross on the mountain.</p>
<p>The mountain moved and rose in the air before the people.</p>
<p>When the patriarch and the believers prostrated themselves, the mountain would descend again to its place; (thus it was) three times.</p>
<p>When the king and all the Muslims saw this miracle and wonder, they were strongly amazed and cried out greatly. They felt a great fear.</p>
<p>O Our Lady Mary, friend of humankind, to the pitiful heart towards the sinners, to the pitiful heart towards the oppressed, you who do not abandon the Christians!</p>
<p>This is not in three nights and in three days, in three months and in three years that the doors of the kings of this world and their dignitaries are opened.</p>
<p>Happy is the man who loves you and whom you love!</p>
<p>Happy is the man who is attached [s’attache] to your aid!</p>
<p>Happy is the man who pursues your power, because he is elevated from the earth to the height of the skies!</p>
<p>Glory to God who has given you to us, to the rich and poor, and to me, too, your servant, for centuries upon centuries, amen ![Translation as of 05/21/22]</p>

108-B,"Patriarch Abraham of Alexandria (d. 978), King al-Muizz, and the parable of the mustard seed (continuation)",Africa Egypt confirmed,"<p>[In History of the Patriarchs of Alexandria by Severus, according to Wikipedia]</p>
<p>This happened just [encore] in the days of the illustrious father, the Patriarch Abraham of Alexandria [TGS says Abba Ephrem, due to the Syrian, but not correct].</p>
<p>There was a king who reigned in Egypt who called himself Mouizz [Abu Tamim Ma'ad al-Muizz li-Din Allah]. He had a general who was Jewish, this one here entered in the law of the Muslims and became like them.</p>
<p>This general had a Jewish friend. This one here would enter with him, at all moments, beside the king, and would talk with the king.</p>
<p>This Jew, when he had found the favor beside the king thanks to his friend the general, expressed a wish beside the king and said to him, “I pray you, o king, to make come the patriarch so that I may compete [dispute] with him before you.”</p>
<p>The king sent a messenger and made come this father; with him was abbâ Sévère Ibn-el-Moqaffa, bishop of the city of Echmouneïn.</p>
<p>They competed [disputèrent] with the Jew, defeated him and thwarted [confondirent] him.</p>
<p>When the king saw that, he rejoiced and gave great honors to the patriarch and those who were with him.</p>
<p>They returned to their homes in peace.</p>
<p>The general was discomfited.</p>
<p>The Jew would seek each day the downfall of the patriarch and all the people of the Christians.</p>
<p>One day, the general entered beside the king and said to him, “These Christians do not have faith. Indeed, it is said in their Gospel: If you have faith like a grain of mustard, you will say to this mountain: Pass and fall into the ocean, that will happen for you .”</p>
<p>When the king heard these words, he sent messengers and made come the patriarch abbâ Ephrem; the king said to him, “What say you concerning these words and concerning your Gospel which says, If you have faith like a grain of mustard, you will say to this mountain: Pass and it  will pass?”</p>
<p>The patriarch said, “Yes, in truth, so says the Holy Gospel.”</p>
<p>The king said, “Behold that you are myriads and myriads of myriads who have faith. I want you to bring me one among you so that he may demonstrate this miracle by his hands. </p>
<p>When the patriarch heard that, he trembled and was very afraid.</p>
<p>He said to the king, “Wait three days for my consideration.”</p>
<p>The king said to him, “May it be as you have said.”</p>
<p>The patriarch left from before the king. He gathered the bishops and monks who were close to him. They stayed in the church of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, Moallaqâ of Cairo, for three days and three nights, standing, praying and begging God.</p>
<p>When it was the third day, in the morning, Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary Mother of God, came and appeared to them with a serene and joyous face. </p>
<p>She said to the bishop, “What has happened to you?”</p>
<p>He responded and said to her, “You know well, o my Lady, what has happened to me.”</p>
<p>She said to him, “Do not be afraid, because behold that I have accepted your request and the tears that you have shed in my church. Now, stand and go to the place of the door of iron that leads to the market; you will find a man who carries a pitcher of water on his shoulders, he has a sole eye: he will demonstrate for you this miracle. The name of this man is ‘Simon he who sews the sandals.’ Indeed, he removed his eye by the order of my beloved Son .”</p>
<p>Now listen, my brothers, of “the order of my Son” of which Our Lady Mary spoke concerning this man: I will narrate to you that which I have heard.</p>
<p>In those days, there was a prostitute who was a daughter of Satan. She would take in her snare numerous men by the desire corrupted by lust.</p>
<p>One day, the enemy of good compelled her and she arrived beside this holy Simon (who later became) a monk. She found him sitting, sewing sandals according to his custom; she stood before him and said to him, “Make me sandals in the size of my foot.”</p>
<p>And she opened her clothes to show him her sandals.</p>
<p>She lifted again her clothes up to her knees to show her the snugness of her flesh and to make him fall in the desire of lust, as the devil had taught her.</p>
<p>When the happy Simon the monk recalled that which Our Lord said in the Gospel, “If your right eye seduces you, tear it out, remove it,and throw it on the ground”, etc., he punctured (?)his eye with an awl. Under the violence of pain, he fell to the ground. </p>
<p>Because of that, Our Lady Mary said to the patriarch, “He is a man who removed his eye because of the command of my beloved Son.”</p>
<p>After that, the patriarch stood, went quickly and found the man. He said to him, “Have pity for the people of the Christians.”</p>
<p>The patriarch told him how Our Lady had appeared to him, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary Mother of God, and how she had spoken about him.</p>
<p>The man prostrated himself while saying, “Pardon me, o my father, because I am a sinner and guilty and I am not capable of that which you have said to me. But may the will of God come, and may the prayer of Our Lady Mary the Twice-Virgin be fulfilled, and may your prayer aid the people of the Christians. I only ask you, o my father, to not reveal my action to anyone, because I do not have the capacity of carrying the glory of this world. Do what I will tell you. Depart to the mountain which I will tell you, with the king, with the priests and also your people, and the Gospels, the crosses, the censers and the candles. May the king, his troops and all his people hold themselves on the same side. I, you, and your people, on the same side. Me, I will hold myself behind you, among your people, and no one will recognize me. Beg God, cry out and say “Kyrie eleison”forty-one times. After that, command the people to be quiet and prostrate themselves with you. Act again in this way three times while making the sign of the life-giving Cross, in the face of the mountain.”</p>
<p>When the patriarch heard this, he took the bishops, the priests, the monks, the people and the believes and arrived beside the king. </p>
<p>The king went out, with him were his troops and all the people of Cairo; they went near the mountain.</p>
<p>The patriarch abbâ Ephrem and the believers held themselves on one side.</p>
<p>The king, his troops and all the people of his house held themselves on the other side.</p>
<p>Next, the patriarch and the believers prayed, and also Simon the monk with them; they prayed, saying, “Lord, have pity for us” for a long moment.</p>
<p>Next, they prostrated themselves three times. Each time they prostrated themselves, the father patriarch would raise his eyes toward the sky and make the sign of the cross on the mountain.</p>
<p>The mountain moved and rose in the air before the people.</p>
<p>When the patriarch and the believers prostrated themselves, the mountain would descend again to its place; (thus it was) three times.</p>
<p>When the king and all the Muslims saw this miracle and wonder, they were strongly amazed and cried out greatly. They felt a great fear.</p>
<p>O Our Lady Mary, friend of humankind, to the pitiful heart towards the sinners, to the pitiful heart towards the oppressed, you who do not abandon the Christians!</p>
<p>This is not in three nights and in three days, in three months and in three years that the doors of the kings of this world and their dignitaries are opened.</p>
<p>Happy is the man who loves you and whom you love!</p>
<p>Happy is the man who is attached [s’attache] to your aid!</p>
<p>Happy is the man who pursues your power, because he is elevated from the earth to the height of the skies!</p>
<p>Glory to God who has given you to us, to the rich and poor, and to me, too, your servant, for centuries upon centuries, amen ![Translation as of 05/21/22]</p>

And there was among the inhabitants of the city a certain poor woman who had broken her foot, and she had nothing whatsoever of this world's goods to give to a physician to heal her. Then her kinsfolk lifted her up and brought her to that church, and they laid her down before the picture of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-bearer, and they left her there by herself and departed; and the verger of the church locked the doors upon her and she was left inside. Now our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, used to come constantly to that church, and to wander up and down therein, and to walk about in it the whole night long, and when the vergers of the church opened the doors [for service] about the hour of midnight they would find her there in visible form. And it came to pass that, on the night whereon they had left the woman with the broken foot in the church, our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, came there according to her wont, and she found her lying before her picture; and she made a sign over her with her foot and said unto her, ""Rise up."" Then straight way the woman rose up and stood upon her feet, and she was sound and whole. And at the season of mid night the verger of the church opened the doors and went in, and he found the woman standing up and he said unto her, ""What hath happened unto thee? And who hath made thee whole?"" Then the woman said unto him, ""Our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, came with her face shining with a light which was brighter than that of the sun, and her garments were perfumed with the odours of sweet incense, and she made a sign over me with her foot, and said unto me, 'Rise up'; and straightway I rose up and stood upon my feet.""

And when her mother heard this she wept and said unto her, ""O my daughter, why hast thou disgraced thyself and destroyed both worlds? Did I not deliver thy soul to the care of the heavenly bridegroom? Why hast thou separated thyself from thy companions? Why hast thou darkened thy light, O my daughter? Who hath clipped thy wings?"" And as she said these words tears poured from her eyes, and she said, ""O my daughter, didst thou not commit thyself to Mary, our Lady, that thou mightest celebrate her commemoration?"" And the daughter would not hearken to her voice, or receive her words, for Satan possessed her, and she dwelt in sin. And then one day when she was in her mother's house, the angel of death came, and she fell down, and as she lay she wept and said, ""Woe is me! I must now go to the Awful King. Woe is me! Woe is me! When the Wise One cometh He will be clothed in light, and I shall be clothed in darkness. Woe is me! Woe is me! When the Wise One cometh with joy and gladness I shall be sorrowful and in shame. Woe is me! Woe is me! What shall I answer? What shall I say? Behold, the angels of darkness will come and meet me with ugly faces; who will receive me kindly? ""And then the virgins her companions came to visit her, and she said unto them, ""O my sisters and friends, formerly I separated myself from you through my sins, and now I do so by my death. O my sisters, remember the love wherewith we loved each other in the days gone by when we walked together in the church at the season of prayer and of the Offering. Woe is me! Woe is me! Behold, O my sisters, I am going to everlasting weeping. Unto whom shall I cry and whom shall I invoke? Woe is me! Woe is me! O my sisters, come ye and weep for me, and reject me not because of my sin."" And as she said these words her tears flowed, and they watered her apparel and even the ground. And when she had said these words she spake unto them, saying, ""Ye shall not make ready my body for burial, neither shall ye lay it in the earth, but cast it forth so that the dogs and the wolves may devour me because of my sin."" And then her mother came and embraced her and said unto her, ""Woe is me! Woe is me! I rejoiced in thy childhood when I saw thee with the virgins thy companions, but now thou hast grown up thou hast made me sorrowful. Woe is me, O my daughter! Woe be to my belly which carried thee for nine months! Woe is me, the sorrowful one! Behold, my heart burneth like fire. Woe is me, O my daughter! Behold, thou art going to the king who is arrayed in fire."" And as she said these words her tears ran down upon the face of her daughter. And then she said, ""O my Lady Mary, I gave [her] to thee to be thy hand maiden and to celebrate thy commemoration; and now thou thyself knowest [what hath happened]."" And then her daughter said unto her, ""O my mother, behold, the whole world is too strait for me. Behold, the angels of darkness who will snatch me away have come. O my mother, hide me in thy bosom so that I may rest a little."" And great outcries arose in the habitation of the widows. And the virgins brought incense, and they took it in their hands, and they shed tears upon it until it was wetted with their tears, and they gave it to Theodore the Bishop so that he might burn it on behalf of this sinful girl their sister; and he prayed to our Lady Mary and offered up the incense. And when it was night our Lady Mary appeared unto a certain virgin and said, ""Bring me all the tears of this wretched girl, and the dust which she hath watered with her tears, and place them in one of the pans of a pair of scales, and bring thou also all her sins and put them into the other pan""; and she did so, and immediately the tears outweighed the sins. And then our Lady Mary said unto Michael, ""Take this girl away and dip her in the water of life three times, and place her among the virgins who are with me."" And when the girl awoke, she told the other virgins and the mother of the girl, and when they heard this they rejoiced and gave thanks unto God and to His mother the Holy Virgin. Budge, E. A.

114,Holy Family cycle: Spring cycle: The thieves who killed each other at the miraculous spring.,Africa Ethiopia probably,"Related to Qemer story [IDs 100, 101, and 114 are translated together (consecutively)] LXXIII THE VIRGIN MARY AND THE SOULS OF THE THIEVES [Brit. Mus. MS. Orient. No. 652. Fol. 110a, No. 87.] AND it came to pass that, after our Lady Mary had brought forth her beloved Son Jesus Christ, and whilst they were living in Bethlehem, Herod the king commanded [his men] to slay all the male children. And when His mother heard this she fled with the Child to the land of Egypt. And as she was journeying along thither the tribulations of the way came upon her, the heat of the sun, the cold of night, and hunger and thirst. And thirst which it is hard to describe seized her, and she asked Him, saying, ""O Lord of all creation, Thou fruit of my womb, I am exceedingly thirsty, give me water to drink just as Thou didst give Thy people water to drink by making it to flow from the rocks. If Thou wert not the King then the Wise Men would not have brought gold to present unto Thee, and the men of Persia would not have brought incense, and they would never have come to worship Thee if the star had not guided them."" And thus saying, she lifted Him up on her shoulders, and by His Godhead He brought forth water of the Garden (i.e. Paradise) which was as white as milk, and it flowed up about her feet and lapped them ; and when she saw this she gave thanks to the Holy Trinity. And after this our Lady Mary drank, and Joseph and Salome drank. And the Child said, ""This water is established until I come in My glory""; but only His mother heard these words. And after they had drunk they rested a little. And the daughter of a thief, who was blind and leprous, came along the road, and mercy drew her, and she put her foot in the water, and she speedily saw the light and was cleansed of her leprosy, and she saw our Lady Mary with the Child and with Joseph and Salome. And she said unto them, ""Who are you?"" And Mary said unto her, ""I am Mary, and [this is] my Son Jesus Christ."" And the daughter of the thief said unto her, ""I believe in thy Son Jesus Christ, and in thy prayer""; and thus saying she worshipped her, and then she returned to her house. And when the men of the city saw her they were astonished, and they said unto her, ""Who healed thee?"" And her brother Yoset also asked her, and she told him, and he said, ""Yesterday I met them on the road, and I took away the Child from His mother, and the odour of His apparel scented me like the odour of sovereignty, and it was diffused in my garments, and to-day the sweet odour of His perfume is fixed therein."" It was this thief who devoured eight and seventy souls, and he, Yoset, was the thief on the right hand. They had the same father and the same mother, and Mary, of the sweet unguent, was their father's sister. And it came to pass after the death of our Lady Mary that the second thief, after slaying and shedding blood, came to that water that sprang up under the feet of our Lady Mary. And he washed away the sweat [caused by] the sun, and he drank, and the water washed over the stone under his head and his sword and his spear, and he fell asleep. And the other thief came to wash there, and when he saw his companion asleep, he took up his sword and cut off his head and he died straight way. And the angels of darkness came and carried him away, shaking his soul as they went. And our Lady Mary came and said, ""This soul belongeth to me""; and the angels of darkness said unto her, ""He neither spared the righteous nor the rich."" And our Lady Mary went and bowed down before our Lord and said unto Him, ""Have mercy upon me, my Son, have mercy upon me."" And our Lord said unto her, ""Mercy is not fitting for him that is drenched in the blood of men."" And our Lady Mary said, ""He who hath washed in the water of the Garden which Thou didst make to spring up hath come to Thee."" And the Lord said unto her, ""For him who hath washed in the water of the Garden which I made to spring up under thy feet the punishment of death is not seemly. Let them wash him again in the water of life and bring him into the Garden (i.e. Paradise)."" And the hosts of angels prostrated themselves, saying, ""Glory be to God Who hath pleasure in man."" And it came to pass that after our Lord Jesus Christ had ascended into heaven, the thief who had killed his companion came and fell asleep in that water of the Garden, and his wish was to be washed therein. And another thief came and saw the chief of the thieves washing, and he said in his heart, ""I will kill my companion on the road, and will cut off his shoulder whilst he is washing."" And as he meditated thus, the thief turned his face and looked at him, and saw him with his head cloth stripped off him. And he ran like a stag, and seized him, and killed him, and returned to the water, and washed again and drank. And he said in his heart, ""This is the water which healed my mother long ago, and cleansed her leprosy, and removed the darkness of her eyes. And now I myself will believe in the prayer of Mary."" And having said this, he set himself by the side of the water, and he placed his spear and his sword under his head and fell asleep. And the daughter of the thieves came to that water that had sprung up under the feet of our Lady Mary—now she was ugly of face, and the form of her body was emaciated, and she was weak and infirm—and she looked at the chief of the thieves lying asleep, and she drew out his sword from his belt and cut off his head. And the hand of God was upon her supporting her, and she remembered what Isaiah, the beloved prophet, had said, ""Blood shall not be cleansed except by blood."" And the other thief came and saw that murderess; and standing afar off he transfixed her with his spear, and she died, and she was made innocent at the water by which she had slain the chief of the thieves, who had never shown mercy on anyone. And quickly came the frightful and terrifying angels of darkness, and they carried away his soul and shook it in a way that ten men could not describe, and they brought it into the third heaven. And our Lady Mary came and said, ""This soul belongeth to me""; and those angels of darkness said unto her, ""There is no man under heaven who hath committed sin as this man hath done."" And our Lady Mary went to our Lord Jesus Christ, and bowed low before Him, saying, ""Have mercy upon me, O fruit of my womb""; and our Lord answered His mother never a word because of the great sin of that man. And again she bowed low before Him, saying, ""Have mercy upon me, O my Son, Whose word can never be made a lie""; and the Lord spake not to her. And she bowed low the third time, saying, ""O Thou Whose word cannot be made a lie, have mercy upon me. He said, I believe in the prayer of Mary, and fell asleep."" And our Lord Jesus Christ said unto her, ""Him who hath remembered thee and invoked thy name, whether he be a righteous man or whether he be a sinner, I will have mercy on him."" And thus saying He had mercy upon him and said, ""Wash him in the water of life, and bring him into the Garden."" O our Lady Mary, may thy prayer and thy petition be with us for ever. Budge, E. A.

And then came two women whose hands were bedevilled, and they cried out to her, saying, ""Have mercy upon us, O Holy Mary, and heal us of our sickness."" And our Lady Mary prayed over them and blessed them, and straight way they were healed. And again an Egyptian woman came in a high fever, and she bowed low before our Lady Mary, and straightway she was healed of her fever. And again another woman, whose right eye had been blinded by a devil, came to our Lady Mary, and entreated her, saying, ""Have mercy upon me, O Lady Mary."" And she laid her hand upon her, and her eye was healed straightway from that very hour. And another woman came whom the devils tortured, and she cried out to our Lady Mary and said, ""Heal me, O my Lady Mary."" And our Lady stretched out her hand, and prayed, and said, ""I adjure you in the Name of Jesus Christ to go forth from this soul, and not to trouble her again."" And the devils went forth from her at that moment, and they cried out, saying, ""What have we to do with thee, Mary, Mother of God? Behold, we are scattered about in all lands through the greatness of the dominion of thy Son. We cannot stand before Him, and He hath brought us down into the depth of the earth. And thou, like Him, hast driven away from us this soul by thy prayer."" And at that moment our Lady Mary drowned them in the abyss of the sea. And then a multitude of sick folk came and gathered together in the house of God, and they asked, saying, ""Where is the blessed Mary?"" And they said unto them, ""She is not here; she liveth in Bethlehem."" And behold, many sick folk came and fell down on their faces at the door of the house of our Lady Mary, and they cried out with a loud voice, saying, ""O holy Mary, Mother of God, have mercy upon us, and heal us, and treat us not with contempt."" And when Mary heard their voice she prayed over them and said, ""O my Lord Jesus Christ, in Thy great majesty receive my prayer, and heal the souls of these people who have come to Thee.""

123,"The chastisement of the heretic, Nestorius.",Africa Egypt probably,"<p>The Story of the death of Nestorius</p>
<p>[Cerulli’s Note:] From another source, which is not still possible to clarify, but which I think is certainly Arab-Christian, it is from the story of the end of Nestorius which is entered in varied Ethiopian stories of the Miracles of Mary. I give here below the text according to the ms. Vat. Et. 43 (with some good variant of the code of Abbadie 165 and 222 of the National Library of Paris):</p>
<p>*Ge’ez text follows*</p>
<p>“Of how She (Mary) punished Nestorius the simulator who had insulted her. The prayer and blessing of Her remain with us in the ages of the ages! Amen. She waited for Nestorius to repudiate the error in which he had fallen. Nor did she leave him preferring his error and, for the grace of God, he died like the death of Herod. This was a manifest thing that the Most Holy Father cursed him saying: “As your tongue has insulted Our Lady the Virgin, your tongue will not be buried in the ground with you. Nor shall your jaws which have served you in life enter.” Then the mouth was beaten from him (Nestorius) and the tongue went out and it fell on the chest of his mouth [“uscì la lingua e gli scese sul petto della bocca”], becoming like the breast of a woman from which milk and corruption do not come.  In such a way he putrefied and died.</p>
<p>Admirable was your patience and your silence, when the son of perdition insulted you! Just as the skies did not collapse to break upon him and the sea did not rise to drown him and because she held the land silent from swallowing him up and the lightning from destroying him? The prayer and the blessing of Our Lady the doubly-holy Virgin Mary, Mother of God, remain with her servant Abrokoros in the ages of the ages! Amen”. </p>

<p>The Rapport Between Nestorians and Monofisiti and the Sources of the Story about Nestorius [Cerulli’s note]</p>
<p>I have already mentioned elsewhere the influence, which the contacts between the various Christian communities in Levante were able to have, favoring otherwise impossible influence. I would like to cite here another typical example, about the Nestorian Church. The Ethiopian Synaxarion, on the date of 12 maskaram, at the end of the passage on the condemnation of Nestorius in the Council of Ephesus, adds: (I take the text from  the Code of Abbadie 66 of the Bibliothèque Nationale of Paris (f. 11r): </p>
<p>*Ge’ez text follows*</p>
<p>“And, if it is said that the Nestorians still do not believe more in the worst belief of Nestorius, we will say rather that because of their contacts with the Jacobites of Syria in the places of Levante, some of these (Nestorians) were converted from their worst doctrine.”</p>
<p>The d’Abbadie 66 is of the 15th century; thus the curious notice of the Nestorians strays from Nestorius belonging already to the first relation of the Ethiopian Synaxarion. It results from that Coptic-arabic. But it is worth remembering that also Giacomo from Verona, in his itinerary of the Holy Land (of 1335) says of the Nestorian community of Jerusalem.  “Some are called Nestorian who had a foundation from Jewish Nestorius and however do not follow him in many ways but more in the way of the Greeks and seem devoted men.” It is still interesting to recall that the attention of the scholars on this news of good rapport between the Jacobites and the Nestorians arrived also in Ethiopia in the curious form of a forfeit by part of the Nestorian Church of the “wicked doctrine” of Nestorius. </p>
<p>About the legend of Nestorius it is to be noted that already in the eulogy (Coptic) of Macarius of Tkoou, attributed (falsely) to Dioscorus of Alexandria thus he told the prodigy: he saw Macarius of Tkoou in a dream in the company of Shenute.  Nestorious comes offering them many riches. “Yes, but first confess your error and recognize for the Virgin the quality of the Mother of God [Θεοτόκος]!”  Nestorius refuses. Shenute therefore pronounces the anathema and makes a sign with his hand to an angel who strikes Nestorius a great wound and places him in great torment. For three hours his tongue comes out of his mouth and worms and rot come out. So the heretic dies of a terrible death.  A narrative very similar to this evidently inspired the Ethiopic text of the Miracles of May, as evidenced by the reference that he  “waited for Nestorius to repudiate his error” and the vague allusion to the wound of Angelo “and his mouth was beaten”.

125,The story of the cannibal from Qemer.,Africa probably,"Rowan; XXIX THE VIRGIN MARY AND THE CANNIBAL OF THE CITY OF KEMER [A. Fol. 63b, 1; B. Fol. 30a, 1.] NOW there was a certain man in the city of Kemer, and he was of noble race and was, in name, a Christian, but his sin was very great, and indeed it exceeded that of all other men, for he did not eat [ordinary] food and the flesh of oxen, but he lived upon human flesh. Now when the cannibal had devoured eight and seventy people among his friends, and his acquaintances, and his kinsfolk, and the men who were in his service, [victims] began to come to an end, for the men who remained had fled from him so that he might not be able to devour them; and he was left alone with his wife and his two children, and them also he ate. And it came to pass that, one day when he was walking on the road, he met a certain husbandman, and he lay in wait for him, and then followed him; and when he knew that the man would be too strong for him he left him and departed. And as he was turning away he said unto the husbandman, ""Sell me an ox, and behold I will give thee my bow which is plated with gold; take it."" And the husbandman said unto him, ""I refuse it wholly, for money and food are more useful to me; I will not give thee the ox."" Then the cannibal spake unto him a second time and said, ""I will also give thee arrows with the bow""; but the husbandman refused [to take them]. And the cannibal again spake to him, saying, ""Show me, I pray, the cave where thou dwellest""; and the husbandman said unto him, ""Behold [it] close by thee. Dost thou not dwell among the habitations of men?"" And he refused to shew him the cave, and as he was turning away he said unto the cannibal, ""Thou art of noble family, but thy heart is depraved and full of guile, and thou appearest to be like unto a rich man who hath his abode in the city of Kemer."" And the cannibal said unto him, ""Why dost thou compare me with such an one, O my brother?"" Then the cannibal took some water away in a drinking vessel, and as he was going along the road he met a certain poor beggar-man whose whole body was covered with the sores and scabs of leprosy; and he wanted to eat the poor man, but he did not like him because of his sores which were putrefying and which stank exceedingly. Now the beggar was thirsty and he begged for some water from the cannibal, and said unto him, ""Give me some water to drink, for God's sake""; but the cannibal became greatly enraged, and heaped abuse upon him. Then the beggar begged again for water for the sake of heaven and earth, and for the sake of the martyrs and the righteous men; but the cannibal re fused [to give him any]. And the beggar begged from him a third time, and said unto him, ""In the name of Mary, give me water to drink before my soul shall de part."" Then the cannibal said unto him, ""Verily, from my youth up, I have heard that she saveth by her prayers, therefore I myself will take refuge in her."" And he said unto the beggar, ""Take, and drink, for Mary's sake""; but when only a very little of the water had gone down his throat, that is to say, about a handful, the cannibal seized him, and before he was able to satisfy his thirst stopped him from drinking. Then the cannibal died, and the angels of darkness took his soul and cast it into Sheol. And our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-bearer, came unto the Son of God and said unto Him, ""Have compassion upon me, O my Son."" And He said unto her, ""What good thing hath he done for thee?"" And she said unto Him, ""He gave a thirsty man water to drinkin my name."" Then the Lord said, ""Bring forth the scales and weigh the souls that he hath devoured against the water that he gave the thirsty man to drink""; and they (i.e. the angels) weighed them, and the little drop of water outweighed the eight and seventy souls. And the angels of light who were looking on marvelled, and they gave shouts of joy because the cannibal was saved and was made to live through the entreaty of our holy Lady, Mary the twofold Virgin, the God-bearer, through whom all things come to pass. Thy love did save the evil-doing cannibal, Because the handful of water [given to] the beggar stood on his side.

<p>After he left the home of his father and mother, having scorned the royalty and abandoned his spouse, to travel far away by a year-long journey, he arrived in a country of the name of Armenia.</p>
<p>There was, in that country, a church that had been constructed in the name of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary mother of God. The church had a rule that all the poor, destitute, and helpless asking for alms would stay in the vestibule (/entrance hall).</p>
<p>The happy Christodule made his abode with the poor and destitute in the vestibule of the church, fasting day and night and not eating, except on Sundays.</p>
<p>He would stay awake throughout the night, praying in his abode, without stopping, standing until the dawn. When the morning came and one rang the bell for the morning service, he would enter with the people in the church and do the service. When he left the church and returned to his abode, he would spend the daytime praying and reading the texts without cease, for the hours of the day and of the night.</p>
<p>He stayed in this manner for fifteen years, without the people knowing of his vigil and his work for God.</p>
<p>After fifteen years, Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary Mother of God, appeared to a virtuous priest, guardian of the door of the church, and said to him, “Tomorrow at the moment of morning, go to the vestibule of the church and to the dwelling of the poor, and enter beside a man whose abode is isolated.”</p>
<p>She gave him all the directions [indications] related to that man there, and the directions related to his dwelling. </p>
<p>She said to him, “Take with you the man of God, bring him here and make him enter the church. Next, may his abode be here in the interior, do not leave him to dwell again with the poor, and call him by the name of ’man of God.’”</p>
<p>When the morning came, the priest went with the directions related to the dwelling of the man, as had been ordered of him by Our Lady; he entered beside him and found him standing, in the middle of prayer.</p>
<p>The priest said to him, “O man of God, behold that Our Lady Mary called you to her home and said to me, ‘Take him, make him enter the church and establish there his abode.’”</p>
<p>Next, the priest addressed himself (again) to the man of God and said to him, “I implore you by Mary mother of God, the pure mother of light praised by the mouth of men and angels. I implore you also by the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit to tell me who you are, what is your country, what is the name of your father, why you have come here and what you are doing.”</p>
<p>Having heard that, the man of God cried and said to the priest, “What do you have, my father? Why do you fret and why do you do ill upon yourself, as you lower yourself before me, the sinner, and implore me with this great and heavy undertaking that is stupefying to hear? I, too, implore you by this undertaking to tell me who informed you for you to recognize me.”</p>
<p>The priest responded and said to the man of God, “Me, I do not recognize you, but on the other hand, Mary my Lady appeared to me in the night and commanded me to bring you here. </p>
<p>“She said to me, ‘Remove the man of God from his abode, make him enter the church and may his abode be in the interior.’</p>
<p>“Because of those words, me, I have come beside you, I have made you enter here and have made you know this.”</p>
<p>The man of God told him all that had happened since his childhood until that day, because he feared the undertaking that the priest had offered. </p>
<p>Having heard the words of the man of God, the priest wept very much, rolled about on the ground, prostrated himself before him and received blessing from him.</p>
<p>Next, the man of God stayed for several days in this church in the country of Armenia. When he knew that the people of the country had learned of his story, the man of God reflected upon it, saying, “If I stay in this country, one will give me grandeur and honor, or otherwise the story will reach as far as my father and he will come and take me.”</p>
<p>He rose and prayed until the middle of the night; he took his leave from the icon of Our Lady Mary and said to her, “O my Lady Mary, seeing as you have revealed my secret to the people of this country, you know, you, that which I fear. Now, it is better for me to go to the land of people who do not recognize me. You, guide me to the place where it may be good for me to go.”</p>
<p>Having said that, he left in the night and went away. No one saw him, nor recognized him among the people of the country. </p>
<p>With the approval of God, he stayed in the vestibule (of the palace) of his father for fifteen years, enduring numerous injuries and mockeries from the part of the servants of his father, for the love of God.</p>
<p>One among them would strike him in the face, another would bash him in the head, another among them would pull on his hair and pull out his beard.</p>
<p>Certain ones would climb above his abode and spread upon him their urine; one doing away with a dish and pouring (dirty water) upon him; another among them would spit upon him his saliva. Another among them would take the bones and remains of meat from the table of the emperor and throw them upon him so that the dogs would tear each other apart upon his limbs.</p>
<p>Enduring all these trials and tribulations, the man of God stayed (still) for fifteen years in the vestibule (of the palace) of his father.</p>
<p>When thirty years had passed for him since he had been abused and tested in the vestibule (of the palace) of his father, Our Lord Jesus Christ descended for him with his mother Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary.</p>
<p>With him were the prophets, the apostles and the martyrs, the entire assembly of virgin nuns and monks, the entire assembly of vigilant angels and the entire assembly of angels and archangels.</p>
<p>He made the soul of Christodule ascend to the kingdom of the skies in great honor and glory. </p>
<p>All this took place by the intercession of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary Mother of God. </p>
<p>Chapter Two</p>
<p>In those days, when the happy and holy Christodule the man of God had finished his spiritual combat and his martyrdom in the country of Armenia and in the vestibule of the palace of his father Theodosius, the king of Constantinople, for thirty years – we have said before in another chapter that Our Lady Mary thus had appeared to a virtuous priest, guardian of the door of his church which was in the country of Armenia, concerning Christodule the man of God -- , likewise Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary Mother of God, appeared, the fourteenth of the month of teqemt, to Theophile the bishop of the city of Constantinople.</p>
<p>She thus spoke to him: “Theophile the patriarch, hear that I order you: go to the home of the king Theodosius and make come the body of the man of God, may your prayer ascend [que ta prière monte].”</p>
<p>Indeed, at that moment, the patriarch was about to say a prayer [était à dire une prière].</p>
<p>When Theophile heard those words, fear and trembling seized him and he fell on his face. Those who found him there were frightened with him, by his fall.</p>
<p>After a long moment, the patriarch abbâ Theophile regathered his strength and rose. He hurried to the king Theodosius, saying, “Is there in your vestibule a dignified man of the kingdom of the skies who died today? Indeed, I heard a voice from the sky: Our Lady was speaking about him. She ordered me to make his body come.”</p>
<p>Theodosius the king said to his servants, “Do you know of a dignified man of the kingdom of the skies who died today in my vestibule?”</p>
<p>His servants said to him, “We do not know of him, our master.”</p>
<p>The king said to them, “Go, then, investigate, search and inquire.”</p>
<p>Next the servants came, they held themselves before the king and said to him, “Our master, there is beside us a poor man whom you appointed to our guard. We are witnesses concerning him, that he is dignified of the kingdom of the skies, because he takes food that you send to him in the evening and morning, as if he was eating it, and he gives it to the poor in hiding. As for him, he fasts day and night. Furthermore, he patiently bears all of your servants who, of a mean manner, insult him, strike him, torment him and mistreat him. Now, o king, let us go and see him.”</p>
<p>The king said to them, “Go then, and hasten yourselves to see him.”</p>
<p>Having gone, the servants found the holy man of God, dead. They said this to the king.</p>
<p>At that moment, the king hurried to abbâ Theophile, saying, “The word that was made announced to you from the height of the skies is true: behold that one found in my vestibule a man of God who died today. Thanks to that, you may accomplish that which was ordered of you by Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary Mother of God.</p>
<p>The patriarch abbâ Theophile took the Scriptures, a cross, and censers, with numerous priests and deacons. They went to welcome the body of the holy man of God in the royal palace.</p>
<p>Next the patriarch, the king, the bishops, the priests and the deacons entered the cabin where the man of God had stayed, to see his holy body. They saw a letter that was gripped in his hand. The king and the priests wanted to take the letter from his hand, but they could not take it.</p>
<p>The patriarch said to them, “My children, come, bring the icon of Our Lady. Rise, pray to God and his mother the holy Virgin Mary so that she may show us the power of her miracle, as she ordered us to come here, and as we may see this miracle and wonder.”</p>
<p>They brought the icon of Our Lady, placed it on a throne of gold and held themselves before her. The king made many torches brought until, alas, their light was like that of the sun. Next they said the prayer of Our Lady Mary sixty four times, according to the number that is fixed for Our Lady. At the end of the prayer, they said, “Lord, have pity for us, Christ, kyrie eleison,” three hundred times.</p>
<p>At that moment, the hand of the holy man of God opened by the will of God and by the intercession of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary Mother of God.</p>
<p>The patriarch approached, took and looked at the letter which was in the hand of the son of the king. When he had read it before the king, the king cried and knew that it was his beloved son. At the same moment, he fell to the ground and rolled about in the ashes. When she heard that, the queen Markêzâ mother of the man of God came, running and striking her chest with a stone.</p>
<p>His fiancée came too, who was suited with him to do good – she had remained alone for thirty years – tearing up her clothing and using it to slap her face. The servants [serviteurs] of the king, and the maids [servantes] and all the people came, and also the patriarch, the bishops, the priests and deacons. They shed bitter tears because of Christodule.</p>
<p>After all that, numerous sick men, people afflicted with illnesses and weaknesses [boiteux; lame]  came on that day. When they touched the body of the saint and paid tribute to his coffin, all were immediately treated and healed of their malady.</p>
<p>And so the patriarch abbâ Theophile cried in a great voice, saying, “O king Theodosius and queen Markêzâ, begetters of this holy man of God, bishops, priests, deacons and all you believers who are assembled here, now it is not suitable for us to cry on the body of this just man, but it is right for us to rejoice. Indeed, he is of God and of his mother, the holy Virgin Mary.”</p>
<p>Thanks to this speech, the patriarch strengthened immediately the people and consoled the afflicted: their affliction changed to joy.</p>
<p>Next, acting according to the rule, they buried in a shroud the holy man of God, in a clothing of fine, immaculate linen. They buried him, in a sarcophagus, in the church of Our Lady Mary. A light descended upon his tomb. His tomb cured all the sick and destitute.</p>
<p>The patriarch blessed all the people, the king and the queen Markêzâ. Once blessed, the people returned to their homes, glorifying God for this miracle and returning grace to our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary Mother of God.[Translation as of 05/21/22]</p>

134,The nominal Christian from Sidon who encountered a serpent/dragon/snake in the desert of Scete,,"LIII THE VIRGIN MARY AND THE SERPENT NEARLY ONE HUNDRED FEET LONG [Brit. Mus. MS. Orient. No. 652. Fol. 63a, No. 51.] THERE was a certain man in the city of Sidon who was the son of parents of exalted rank; he was akin to the royal family, and was in name a Christian, but he committed many sins, and was a notorious sinner among sinful men. Now he was exceedingly rich. And he did not know that God had created him, and he never called upon His Name; and he was a destroyer and a robber. And one day he took his weapons for the chase to go out to hunt in the desert of Scete. And when in the course of his hunting he entered into a dense mass of trees and thorny undergrowth and creepers, he came across a huge serpent that had come forth from its hole, and it gaped at him with its mouth and raised up its head to a height of fifteen cubits. Its eyes were like unto coals of fire, and its mane (or, hair) like [that of] a horse, and its tail like a spark (sic). And when the man saw him he was terrified, and at the moment when the serpent came towards him to swallow him up, he cried out with a loud voice, saying, ""O Mary, I have heard the story about thee, that thou art the deliverer of those who put their trust in thee, and that thou makest manifest thy wonderful deeds to those who believe on thee, O thou, of whose name those who are perishing, and those who are in captivity, and those who are in prison, and those who are on dry land, make mention, if thou wilt deliver me this day from this accursed serpent, the messenger of the Devil, by the might of thy Son Jesus Christ and by thy prayer, I will become thy servant, and I will minister to the Church until the day of my death."" And our Lady Mary made strong the heart of that man, and he took his bow and stretched it, and shot at the accursed serpent, and hit it with forty arrows, which were aimed with fury. And when the strength of the serpent failed and it fell down, the man took his shield and his spear, and he smote it on the head, and drew out its brain, and he found therein a very precious pearl which shone with great brilliance. And at that moment he heard a voice in the desert that said, ""O wandering man, attribute thy happy [escape] to Mary. Out of thy vast riches build thou a martyrium to her in the city of Sidon, and fix thou in the eastern chamber thereof this pearl which thou hast found in the head of the serpent, so that it may shine by night and give light unto those who dwell between the border of the plain of the mountain and the sea-shore, and it shall be a sign until the coming of her beloved Son. And call thou that church, 'The Sign of Mary.' "" And after this the man measured the length and the breadth of the serpent, and its length was 60 cubits (i.e. between 90 and 100 feet), and its breadth (circumference) 20 cubits (i.e., between 30 and 33$ feet). And those who saw this miracle which our Lady Mary had performed marvelled, and they gave thanks to God and to our Lady Mary. Now through that portion of the desert there ran a highway for caravans, with a market place at the end of it. And the people rejoiced greatly at the death of that serpent, for it used to attack and seize and swallow every living creature that it saw, from men to cattle and sheep, and the wild creatures of the desert, and the feathered fowl of the heavens, and it used to roar like a lion and go about seeking what it could devour. And our Lady Mary crushed its head by the might of her Son, and removed a reproach from men.

136,The thief whom the king's soldiers could not kill.,Levant probably (Galatia),"<p>There was a man of the name of Qirâs the Strong in the country of Galatia, a brigand killer of men. He would go from the plains to the mountain and from the mountain into the caves. He would kill all those whom he encountered on the routes and in the streets, on the squares [places] and crossroads, night and day.</p>
<p>One heard talk of him in all the provinces and regions, all the people were afraid of him.</p>
<p>Having heard talk of him, the king of that country sent heralds to all the provinces and markets; he made them say in this way, “Seize Qirâs the thief and brigand, strike him and bring him to me. The man who seizes him and brings him to me, I will cover him with great honors.”</p>
<p>The people of Galatia rose against Qirâs and the guards who resided there, having assembled, went to the place where Qirâs the brigand was, for the order of the king was imperative. The people of Galatia surrounded him like the expanse (?) of the sea.</p>
<p>They seized Qirâs the brigand and brought him to the king. The king commanded that he be crucified on the wood of the cross, with his head below.</p>
<p>As for Qirâs, who would do evil actions, he would say in the way of prayer, in fear and trembling, “Greetings to you, o my Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary Mother of God.”</p>
<p>He said, “In truth, powerful is your name in all places!”</p>
<p>He did not cease speaking of his mouth for a sole instant, not even for the time of a blink of an eye. He spoke, having been crucified on the wood. </p>
<p>The king commanded his soldiers to cut off his head by the sword.</p>
<p>And so, all the troops of the king, the chiefs [chefs] and the officers went out and found him crucified, all while being alive.</p>
<p>All the soldiers of the king took their swords and their lances; they pierced him with the lance and struck him with the sword, they could not kill him.</p>
<p>They pierced him in his side, up to his stomach, with the edge of the sword and of the lances, nothing could harm him.</p>
<p>Seeing that, the people and the troops were amazed and stupefied; all the people who were there were astounded.</p>
<p>Qirâs the thief and brigand said to them, “No one can do me violence, and no one can bring it upon me, while the mother of the light is with me. Behold that she covers me with her tutelary shadow, diverts from me your rage and your anger and protects my body from your instruments of torture.”</p>
<p>Having heard those words, the soldiers took him down from the tree, took him and made him hold himself before the king in the courthouse. </p>
<p>The king interrogated him about everything and about the manner in which he had been saved from the edge of the swords and of the lances.</p>
<p>He narrated to the king the miracle of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary Mother of God, how she had acted for him and how she had saved him from his anger and from his rage.</p>
<p>The king said to him, “How have you been saved, Qirâs the thief and brigand?”</p>
<p>Qirâs the thief said to him, “Me, I love Our Lady with my heart and with my mouth. I never cease, in any time and in any moment, to greet Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary Mother of God.”</p>
<p>The king said to him, “How do you desire to live then, upon the Earth?”</p>
<p>Qirâs the thief responded and said to the king, “I desire with ardor to do penitence and to turn myself towards Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary Mother of God, to serve and to preside for her church all the days of my life.”</p>
<p>After that, the king freed him and left him to go where he wished in peace, because of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary Mother of God.</p>
<p>After that, Qirâs the thief made himself a monk. His soul was sanctified with his body by the prayer of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary Mother of God. He stayed to serve her church with a pure heart and serene spirit.</p>
<p>He did not cease to venerate and greet Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary Mother of God, until the day of his death and he entered in the garden of eternal joy.</p>
<p>As for the king, he was saved from numerous combats and perils, from the war and from the maw of predator lions, from the bitter destruction when he invoked the name of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary Mother of God.[Translation as of 05/21/22]</p>

137,Sybil the prophetess saw a vision of the Virgin Mary holding her child within a circle around the sun and the Emperor of Rome erected an altar in his palace.,Levant confirmed (Constantinople),"CX THE VIRGIN MARY AND THE KING WHO DEDICATED AN ALTAR TO HER [Brit. Mus. MS. Orient. No. 652. Fol. 32b.] THERE was once a great and glorious and mighty king who ruled over all the earth, and all peoples were subject unto him and served him as vassals, and great and mighty kings abased themselves before him. Now he was a wise and understanding man, and because of their great love for him the people gathered together and said unto him, ""Thou knowest that thou art great, and dost rule to the uttermost ends of the earth, and that thy power is mighty; and behold, we love to serve and worship thee."" And he said unto them, ""This thing (i.e. adulation) is not seemly for me,"" and they began to weary him with their words. And he meditated in his heart and said, ""I am a man, a creature of the dust, and mortal, and it is not right for them to worship me like God, the Most High."" And he was sorrowful in his mind and knew not what to do. And he sent for a certain wise woman whose name was Sabela (Sybilla) who dwelt in that city, and when she had approached him he took her to his habitation privily, and told her what the people were saying about him and [how] they were wearying him. And she said unto him, ""Only wait for three days""; and she continued to beseech God, Who is to be praised! as to what he should do. And on the third day she saw a vision at noonday, the sun standing in the middle of the heavens with a ring of gold encircling it, and a virgin who was brighter than the sun, and in her lap was a little Child, Whose face was brighter than all lights. And the wise woman said unto the king, ""Look at the sun""; and the king lifted up his eyes to heaven, and God showed him everything according as the prophetess had seen. And the king said unto her, ""What is this vision? And who is the maiden, and who is the Child?"" And the wise woman said unto him, ""This Virgin is the altar of heaven, and the Child is the King of the heavens and the earth: He is God and man perfect, and to Him ser vice and worship are meet."" And the king said unto her, ""What sacrifice, and offering, and gift ought the people to offer unto Him?"" And the woman said unto the king, ""He loveth not offerings of beasts, but He doth love choice, fine and pure incense."" And the king commanded them forthwith to make an altar in his habitation, and he took pure incense and offered it up thereon, and he called it the "" Heavenly Altar."" And that altar existeth in the city of Rome to this day, and it is called the ""Heavenly Altar,"" and it was that which saved the king from wickedness that day.

One day his enemies came upon him suddenly outside the town, and they killed him and left him lying there where he was. And some other people came along the road and found him, and having found him they buried him on the road-side. Forty days later our Lady Mary appeared to a deacon who loved her, and who feared God, and she was angry with the men who had killed the deacon. And she said unto him, ""O my beloved, those men killed a deacon who loved me, and [men] buried him outside the consecrated burial-ground, and this is a disgrace to me. And behold I tell you that that deacon repented during his lifetime with a sincere repentance. I command you to tell the deacons to go and bring him out of the place where he is and to bury him in consecrated ground among the believers."" When the deacon heard these words from our Lady Mary he rose up straightway, and assembled all the deacons and told them what he had seen. And they all went outside the city and opened the deacon's tomb and brought him out, and when they had done so they found a beautiful sweet-smelling flower.

Fol. 73a, 1.] THERE was a certain man who was an envoy of the king, and he was a Persian and belonged to the company of the horsemen, and his name was Nicodemus. Now, he sinned greatly, and his offences were innumerable, and he committed fornication with lewd women beyond measure, and he was evil in all his ways. But through the intercession of our holy Lady, Mary the twofold Virgin, the God-bearer, the mercy of God visited him, and she had compassion upon him and de livered his soul, and he repented of his sins and forsook all the evil of his works, and turned unto God with a ready heart; and he cast away the lust of the flesh, and became a monk in a certain monastery. And the good and gentle prior undertook to train him himself, and he wished to teach him the Psalms of David, so that he might use them as prayers at the season of prayer; but the monk was unable to learn. Then again he wished to teach him, ""Our Father, which art in heaven,"" but he was unable to master it. And it was only by means of great toil and labour that he learned to say, ""Salutation to our holy Lady, Mary the twofold Virgin, the God-bearer!"" Now he loved this prayer, and he recited it always and continually, both by day and by night, and in his sitting down and in his rising up, and in his coming in and in his going out, and he repeated it incessantly. And after he was dead and had departed from this fleeting world, a great miracle was made manifest at his grave. A splendid tree, which was most beautiful, and unto which no other tree could be compared, took root and grew up over his grave, and on the leaves thereof were written in letters of gold the words, ""Salutation unto thee, O my Lady Mary!"" And those who saw the miracle marvelled greatly at the beauty of the tree in every part of it, and they found that it was planted in the heart of the man, and that it had put forth its shoots through his tongue and through his mouth. Then they knew that he had lived with a pure heart and sincere mind whilst he prayed the prayer of ""Salutation"" unto our Lady Mary. And forthwith they all cried out together with a loud voice, and they glorified God, and gave praise unto our Lady Mary, the store house of compassion, and they multiplied their ministrations unto her and paid greater honour unto her than before. O my Lady Mary, as thou didst choose Nicodemus the envoy, A man who had committed multitudes of sins and offences, To praise thee with a pure heart and with a sincere mind, Even so do thou choose me to perform good deeds of every kind.

And he loved our holy Lady, Mary the twofold Virgin, the God-bearer, from the depth of his heart, and he served her with all his might; and through his love for her he was wont to wear sack cloth on his body beneath his apparel. And it came to pass that when the sackcloth garment had become old and ragged, he wished to make another garment of sack cloth to wear in its stead, and he took a piece of new sackcloth, and went with it into his cave so that he might cut out the garment from it, and sew it together and put it on in secret, in order that no man might know anything about what he did. And when he had sat down in his cave he was puzzled how to make the garment, for he neither knew how to cut it out nor how to sew it up. And whilst he was troubling himself about this our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, appeared unto him and said unto him, ""Be not troubled.

Fol. 27b, 1.] NOW there was a certain deacon in the city of Rome whose name was Anastasius, and he feared God and loved our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-bearer. And he used to visit the church of our Lady, the Mother of mercy, and make pure first-fruit offerings unto her, and pay honour unto her with gifts and salutations, saying, ""Rejoice, O thou Virgin un dented, who hast given birth unto Emmanuel! Hail to thee, O thou who art full of grace, for thou hast given birth unto the Light that is before all others! Rejoice, O thou who hast given birth unto our Redeemer! Rejoice, O holy Virgin, who hast given birth to Christ and didst bring Him into the world without union with man! Therefore shall the nations bow down and adore thee, O thou who didst give birth to our Light. I beseech thee to be for me a mediator between me and thy Son."" And in this wise used he to pray in the church when the heavenly Offering was being made, and at the time of the Five Joys of Mary. And it came to pass after these things that the deacon fell sick and was nigh unto death, and the angel of death struck fear into his soul. Then our Lady Mary, the storehouse of mercy, the blessed Virgin, the joy of Christian folk, who sheweth favour unto kings, the mis tress of the angels, and the crown of the martyrs, appeared unto him, and said unto him, ""Why fearest thou with so great a fear? And why art thou dismayed? For when thou wast in good health thou didst greet me joy fully each and every day. And now, fear not, O my be loved, and let not thine heart be terrified, for no evil thing shall draw nigh unto thy body, and thou shalt not be terrified at the angel of death. As thou didst never cease [to praise me] with thy mouth, and didst greet me with joy, so likewise thou shalt find joy and be with me in the Garden (i.e. Paradise) for ever."" And when the deacon heard these words he found peace, and he thought that he would recover from his sickness. Then he awoke from his sleep and found his soul in great joy and gladness; and immediately he awoke he died, and his soul went forth from his body. And our pure Lady Mary received it in her hands, and it entered with her into the Garden of Joy, and into the place of delight and pleasure, where it would neither perish nor come to an end for ever. May the prayer of our Lady give our King David help, and make him to be girded about with power, and make him to be free from the opposition of the wicked and from the hosts of the enemy, and from the bow directed at him and from the sharp spear.

143,"Alexander, a Jew from Jerusalem, is delivered three days after he was swallowed up by a dragon.",,"<p>There was a Hebrew of a family of people honored by the city of Jerusalem, in the name of Alexander. They went according to the nature of the Jews and made numerous sins that irritated God.</p>
<p>One day, while they were fishing with the net, came beside him, from [depuis] the desert to the seaside, a great dragon roaring like a lion. He opened his maw and approached to swallow the Hebrew.</p>
<p>He cried at the top of his voice saying, “My Lady Mary the merciful, if you save me today from this serpent, I will become a guardian for your church for all the days of my life, until the day of my death, and I will serve you with a valiant heart and fervent love.”</p>
<p>While he was saying that, the serpent swallowed the man alive and he stayed for three days and three nights in the belly of the serpent.</p>
<p>After three days, the serpent spit out the man and he went out with the coughing of the serpent.</p>
<p>All his body had dried, covered with leprosy and having become ulcerous.</p>
<p>The people of the city encountered him and questioned him about all that had happened because of that which he had done. He narrated everything to them, about how it had happened and how great misfortune and misery had reached him because of his sin.</p>
<p>They took him and conducted him to the place which he had indicated to them, in the church of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary Mother of God.</p>
<p>When his relatives saw him, they moaned and trembled; they shed great tears and were bitterly and painfully distressed.</p>
<p>They implored Our Lady Mary to cure him in her perfect mercy.</p>
<p>That day, Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, — Mârihâm in Hebrew – , appeared to Alexander.</p>
<p>She said to him, “Listen and understand that it is I who has made you come out of the belly of hell and of death (in ?) the sludge. It is I who commanded the serpent to cough you out alive, and after three days, so that the power of my Son would appear upon you. Now go, immerse yourself and wash yourself in the pool of Siloam [Siloé].”</p>
<p>Having said that, she disappeared from his sight. At the moment of morning, he rose and recounted to (his relatives) the whole vision – how Our Lady had appeared to him, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary Mother of God.</p>
<p>He asked them to conduct him to the desert of Jordan in the valley of Siloam, where John the Baptist [Jean Baptiste] resided, at Aenon [Énom] near Salim </p>
<p>His relatives took him and conducted him there, the place that had been ordered of him by Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary Mother of God.</p>
<p>He acted thus and immersed himself: he was healed of his malady and purified of his leprosy. He returned from there, back to his home.</p>
<p>Those who saw and heard of this wonder returned grace to Our Lady Mary, lauded her for this miracle that she had made upon this man and glorified her beloved Son. They were strongly amazed and stupefied.</p>
<p>The man stayed to serve in the church of Our Lady with many efforts and fatigues, in a great vigil, until he died and left this transitory world.</p>
<p>Our Lady made his soul pass in eternal joy that does not disappear or perish, to the country of joy and exultation, there, where those who have been saved by the prayer of Our Lady are reunited, there, where Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and all those who have pleased his Son by the beauty of their (spiritual) combat are.</p>
<p>She established the abode of this sinner with those in eternal rest and gave him a part of inheritance with the athletes [athlètes] of God.</p>
<p>Who is like her? Whoever confides in her is not rejected nor disdained. [Translation as of 05/21/22]</p>

Mus. MS. Orient. No. 652. Fol. 7b.] THERE was a certain God-fearing monk, who was of good disposition, and was pleasing to the brethren, and one day there overtook him a defilement which the Enemy brought upon him seeing his patient endurance. And that monk continued to weep over his sin by day and by night, and he lacked someone who would examine him and deliver him, and he fell into despair. And he heard that there was a certain monk who knew how to read and write, and who was a servant of God, and he went to him. And on the road Satan, disguised as a monk, met him, and he said unto him, ""Whither goest thou?"" And the monk said unto him, ""Whither my need urgeth me""; and the Enemy said unto him, ""I beseech thee to tell me [about it]."" And when Satan importuned him, he told him, and said unto him, ""I am going to such and such a man that he may deliver me."" And Satan spake many words, and he who is not humble humbled himself, and he said unto the monk, ""I am indeed the man with that name."" And straightway the monk fell down and grovelled at his feet, and wept. And Satan said unto him, ""Weep not, I will deliver thee."" And the monk said unto him, ""A falling of the flesh came upon me one day""; and the Enemy said unto him, ""Thou hast done what is not seemly. It would have been far better for thee to have murdered some one, or to have committed robbery or theft than to have done this thing. Now as it is, there is no salvation for thee unless thou dost mutilate thy self."" And the monk said, "" If by doing this I shall obtain forgiveness I will do it""; and he mutilated himself, and his blood went forth from him and he died straightway. And the Enemy of virtues took his soul and carried it away. And the monk to whom the dead monk was going knew that he wished to come to him, and through his spiritual excellence he mounted up upon a cloud, and flew along, and he met him on the Path of Souls, and through the might of God he seized Satan, and he said unto him, ""Whither art thou carrying this soul? "" And Satan said, "" He hath committed two sins. 1. Being a monk he lapsed from purity. 2. He hearkened to my voice and mutilated himself. Now the Apostles say: The Christian who letteth out blood except because of some disease, shall fast forty days."" This is what Satan said. And the monk said unto Satan, ""Thou didst disguise thyself to him and pretend to be I, and didst lead him astray."" And the Enemy said, ""I will not give him unto thee, but will carry him to Sheol."" And the monk said, ""I and thou will go to our Lady Mary that she may decide for us""; and forth with they went. And the monk said [unto her], "" O our Lady, this monk was coming to me to get comfort from me, and this Satan who made himself look like me found him, and advised him to mutilate himself. And it is about this that we are disputing."" The Enemy said, ""He hearkened to my words, and killed himself, and I am going to take him to Sheol."" And our Lady Mary said: ""I will judge rightly. The soul shall return to its body, but the mutilated part shall not be rejoined thereto."" And the monk worshipped our Lady. And the mutilated monk lived, and for the rest of his days he was like Anthony and Macarius, and was accept able to his Lord.

Fol. 38a.] THERE was a certain monk whose name was Gerdan, and when he was in the world he loved to go to Abba Jacob, and carry out for him all that he needed doing. And he rose up to go, and his wife went with him to set him on his journey, and animal desire overcame him, and he lay with her and then went on with his companions. And when he was far from his abode, a handsome Satan appeared unto him in the form of Abba Jacob, and said unto him, ""Thou dost not know me. After thou hast mutilated thyself thou mayest save thy soul, but if thou wilt not mutilate thyself God will never forgive thee all thy sin."" Now the man did not know the Satan, but having heard his words and imagining that he was Abba Jacob, he drew the hunting knife from his girdle and mutilated himself: he then plunged the knife into his neck (or, throat) and slit it open, and then fell to the ground drenched with his blood. And when his friends saw him drenched with blood they fled from him, being afraid lest people should say that they had killed him for the sake of his money. And after he was dead the hosts of Satan surrounded his soul. And as they were going along the road they came to a church of Peter, and they were rejoicing because of the soul which they had entrapped, and they met there Abba Jacob and Peter the Apostle, who said unto them, ""Why have ye acted thus and taken the soul of this man?"" And the devils described unto them all the man's deeds, and his sin, and how he had killed himself. And Abba Jacob said unto them, ""Ye corrupted him beforehand with fornication, and then ye appeared unto him in my form, and he committed this act of suicide because of my command. Now will I turn you back to my Lady, and she shall judge between me and you""; and they went to the Holy Virgin. And the angels and the righteous rejoiced, and the believing ones came, and they decreed that the man's soul should return to its body, and forthwith the man rose up alive without pain and without suffering, but the scar in his neck caused by the knife remained [visible]. Now the mutilated portions of his body were not restored. And he went to Abba Jacob and returned to the monastery, wherein he followed the ascetic life, and he lived with the saints in great humility until he died and entered into the kingdom of the heavens.

146,The knight who wanted to seduce the daughter of the cobbler.,Europe confirmed,"XLIII THE KNIGHT AND THE MAIDEN MARY [Brit. Mus. Orient. 652. Fol. 39b, No. 34.] AND there was a shoemaker who had a daughter whom God had given unto him, and she had spiritual excellences that were far superior to her beauty, and she was devoted to fasting and prayer. And she was pure from all sin, and transgression, and she loved our Lady Mary with all her heart and with all her mind; and her name was Mary. And one day, as she was sitting before the picture of our Lady Mary, she said, ""O my Lady Mary, my name is Mary, but it befitteth me not; it is suitable for thee only, for thou art pure from sin. And behold, I commit myself unto thee to keep me in thy mercy; and do thou remove from me all the power of the Enemy through thy love, O thou joy of the sorrowful and hope of the poor."" And when Satan, the enemy of the race of the children of men, knew of this he brought crafty tricks to attack her. And there was a certain horse-soldier, who was exceedingly rich, and his goods and possessions were very many, and as he was entering that city he met the maiden—now he was a lover of women—and as soon as he saw her his heart was smitten with love for her. And he sent unto her a certain woman who was pleasing in her person and of gracious disposition, one who corrupted the souls of men by her operations and by her voice, for the incantation of Satan was on her tongue. And she began to talk to that maiden about the destroying desires of the world, and to belaud fine and beautiful things, and how to catch the souls of men with a rope by means of magic. And when the maiden heard her words, she understood and knew well what she was seeking for and her intention, and she began to ill-treat her person and to curse her work. And the maiden drove her away from her, and the woman departed with her apparel dis arranged, and she repented that she had gone to her. And when she came to the horseman and reported to him concerning what the maiden had said unto her, his heart blazed with love for the maiden. And he said unto the woman, ""Old woman, advise me what I shall do."" And the daughter of Satan said unto him, ""I will counsel thee. Her father is a poor man and thou art a man of wealth. Summon him to thy house, and give him some of thy money, and let him bring the maiden."" And when the horseman heard this he sent for her father immediately. [And when he came] the horseman embraced him, and arrayed him in his own apparel, and gave him much gold and silver. And he said unto him, ""From this moment thou art my brother, and thou shalt be my friend, and whatsoever thou lackest I will give thee. And I demand nothing whatsoever from thee except one thing, which thou shalt do for me, and wilt find it beneficial for thyself, and thou wilt gain much money—that is to say, bring me thy daughter, and I will make her the richest woman in the city."" And when the father of the maiden heard the words of the horseman he rejoiced, and he rose up straightway and took the maiden against her will, and carried her to the horseman whilst she sorrowed and wept tears. And when she knew that there was no one who could help her she cried out to God and to our Lady Mary, saying, ""O my Lady, thou lover of men and hope of the poor, let thy power and thy majesty deliver me from this wicked man who is like unto Satan, the de stroyer of souls."" And when that man saw her excessive sorrow and weeping, he had pity on her tears, and he said unto her, ""Why weepest thou and why art thou thus sorrowful?"" And she said unto him, ""I have vowed myself and my virginity to my Lady, the Virgin Mary, the mother of mercy. And if thou dost trespass upon what is committed unto her she will take vengeance upon thee on the day of the Resurrection of the dead when thou shalt stand before her Son, the righteous Judge."" And when that man heard the name of our Lady Mary, God set in his heart a great fear, and his members shook like a reed in a strong wind. And he said unto her, with fear and in a gentle voice, ""Dost thou wish to become a nun?"" And she said unto him, ""Yea, I wish to serve the Lady Mary whom I love. I wish to serve her, and I long to see her."" And he said unto her, ""I will make thee a nun in a nunnery, and I will endow the nuns with great possessions."" And the nuns rejoiced, and he endowed them with great possessions and provided meat and drink for their sustenance, and he used to visit them in the love of God. And one day he went forth into the battle and died, and the Abbess and her daughters heard about it. Now the horseman had said unto them, ""If I die, bury me near you in your nunnery, because I have done good unto you."" And our Lady Mary appeared unto the Abbess and said unto her, ""Go thou with thy daughters, and bring in the body of the nobleman, and bury him near you."" And the Abbess said, ""We cannot, for we are afraid of the Fathers (Archbishops?) and Bishops."" And our Lady Mary said unto her, ""I will give thee a good sign that no one shall be able to oppose thee without being punished by me."" And the Abbess and all the nuns rose up and went to the body of the governor, and they found in his mouth a young branch, every leaf of which was fashioned in gold and had upon it an image of our Lady Mary. And they took the body of the governor, and wrapped it in costly apparel, and buried it with exceedingly great honour. And this took place through the love of our Lady Mary who loveth all those who trust in her, and who honoureth those who take asylum with her and rewardeth them in this wise, and even more abundantly, and maketh them to come into the path of righteousness.

Fol. 42a, No. 35.] THERE was a certain little boy in the city of Tiros (Tyre) who was a Jew, and he used to be taught with Christian children in a certain place. And when the festival of the Passover arrived the Christian children went to make offerings according to their custom, and the Jewish boy came with the Christian children and offered up with them. And as the priest was ad ministering the Offering to the people that Jewish boy saw a beautiful woman, who was arrayed in splendour and in glorious apparel, helping the priest at the altar. And when the Eucharist was ended, that boy came back to the house of his father; and his father said unto him, ""Why hast thou tarried so long?"" And the boy said unto him, ""I was in the church with the Christian children, and I offered with them."" And when the father heard this he was wroth with his son, and he turned towards the oven that was in his house, and that he had made red hot, and he seized his son and threw him into the oven, and shut the door of the furnace upon him. And when the boy's mother heard she cried out with a loud voice and wept. And many people, both Jews and Christians, gathered together, and they went to the furnace and opened it, and they found the boy alive and uninjured by the fire; and they called him and he went forth from the oven, and the fire had not hurt him, and had singed neither his clothing nor his hair; and they marvelled and were silent before this great miracle And they asked the boy and said unto him, ""What didst thou do?"" And he told them how he had received the Mystery, and how he had seen our glorious Lady Mary helping the priest at the moment of celebrating the Offering, and how that same Lady had caught him when his father cast him into the fire, .so that it did not touch him, and how she covered him over with her apparel. And when the Christians heard the voice of the boy they glorified God, the Most High, and our Lady Mary, the lover of mankind. And she seized that Jew, the father of the boy, and in his turn he was burned and became ashes; now the boy, and his mother, and all [the people of the house] became Christians. Budge, E. A.

148,The pregnant woman who was caught by the tide while going to the church of Saint Michael (Mont Saint Michel) and gave birth,Europe confirmed (France),"Rowan, Budge XXXII THE VIRGIN MARY AND THE WOMAN WHO WAS ABOUT TO BRING FORTH [A. Fol. 70b, 1; B. Fol. 58a, 1 and 2.] NOW there was a certain city wherein a church had been built, and the church was built in the name of the Archangel Michael, and each year, on the twelfth day of the month Hadar, which is the day of the festival of the Archangel Michael, great numbers of the inhabitants of the city did not fail to visit his church—may his intercession and his supplication keep our King David from the evil enemy! And behold, it came to pass one day when the people were journeying along the road to come to that church, that a mighty roaring rush of waters came from the sea, and it burst upon the people and alarmed and terrified them exceedingly, and drove them out of their senses; and the water surrounded that place and rose to a height of about two measures, and the people were wellnigh drowned. Then each and every one of them made sup plication unto God, and every man sought out a means whereby he might save himself, and they took to flight and fled before the waves which rolled in from the sea, so that they might not be drowned by the waters, according to that which was wont to happen. And behold, there was a certain woman travelling with the company who was with child, and her time for bringing forth was nigh, and she was unable to run away with the other people. And she cried out after those who had forsaken her and fled, but no man turned back to have regard unto her, and she found none to help her, and despaired utterly of obtaining help from man. Then she cried out with tears unto God, the Most High, and unto our Lady Mary, the storehouse of compassion and mercy, who calleth every one unto the love of her beloved Son, the Redeemer of the world. And it came to pass that, when those who had taken to flight arrived at the seashore, she stretched out her hands, and raised her eyes to God in heaven, and made supplication unto our Lady Mary with great outcry and with much weeping and lamentation. And the waves of the sea stood there through the might of the billows thereof, and our Lady Mary brought tidings of hope and joy unto the woman, and covered her with her garments, and hid her from the sight of the sea. And the woman thought that she was in a well-built and well-furnished house. Then whilst she was in the midst of the sea, the pains of childbirth took hold upon her, and our Lady Mary took the child from her womb; and she gave birth to a fine boy. And his mother called her boy ""Abraskirospas"" [a name that means] in Greek and Hebrew "" The hand of Mary touched him and blessed him in the womb of his mother."" Now neither pain nor a flow of blood came to his mother [when she brought him forth]. And it came to pass that, when the sea returned into its own place, and the waters thereof became quiet, and the waves went down, the woman went forth from it carrying her child in her arms. And when the people saw her many of them marvelled and became speech less by reason of this great and miraculous thing, and they all ran after her and followed her, and when they had come up with her they asked her questions [about it]. And the woman related unto them the great and wonderful miracle which Mary, the Mother of Life, the vessel of prophecy, had wrought. And she told them how the Virgin had hidden her beneath the dark masses of the water so that she might not suffer death. And those who heard this story, men and women, children and aged folk, young men and babes, Jew and Gen tile, and all the people of the world, marvelled exceedingly, and they gave thanks unto the God of righteous ness, and they multiplied the praises of our Lady Mary, who worketh miracles innumerable, whose beauty is immeasurable, and whose rule is beneficent and ineffable. As thou didst cover over with thy garments the woman who was with child, and who was in the midst of The terrible waves of the sea, at the hour of her bringing forth and bearing a son, Even so cover thou me over, and let not my need be too hard for me, O my Lady Mary, who didst receive me into thy care from the womb, and cover thou me with vestments of light and not of skin.

150,The divorced wife who prayed for revenge against her rival.,Europe probably,"XLV THE VIRGIN MARY AND THE MAN WHO FORSOOK HIS WIFE [Brit. Mus. Orient. No. 652. Fol. 45a, No. 38.] THERE was a certain man who left his wife and took another woman. And when the wife heard of it she sorrowed with a great sorrow, and she could find none to help her, and her sorrow increased. And she meditated in her heart and said, ""Since I have found no one to help me, behold, I must take asylum with her who is able to obtain whatsoever she wisheth from her Son, God, the Virgin Mary, the mother of mercy."" And she went daily to the church and prostrated herself before the altar of our Lady Mary, and she prayed there with a sad heart, and wept bitterly. And she said in her prayer, ""O my Lady Mary, the mother of mercy, I beseech thee to destroy for me this harlot woman who hath taken my husband from me amd left me [only] my grief; I beseech thee to avenge me on her. Let her fall sick, or die, or suffer tribulations, so that my husband may escape from her and return to me."" And all day long she prayed this prayer to our Lady Mary. And our Lady Mary appeared unto her by night, and said unto her, ""Woman, what is this petition wherewith thou petitionest me? And what is this prayer that thou makest to me? This prayer is wicked, for thou wishest me to kill my handmaiden. This woman boweth daily before my image, and she embraceth me, and maketh one hundred prostrations before me, and if I kill her for thy sake how can I be the mother of mercy? Nevertheless I do wish her to repent and to turn from her sin."" And the Virgin disappeared. And when the woman woke up from her dream, her sorrow was still acute, and she rose up in the morning and went to the church. And as she was going along the road she met the woman who had taken her hus band from her, and her wrath waxed furious against her, and she cursed her and said unto her, ""O thou harlot, thou knife-eyed woman, who art wholly without shame in thy face, thou hast taken away from me the husband who was my joy in my life and my protection in my death. Yet in spite of this thou servest my Lady Mary, and bowest down to her, and embracest her one hundred times every day, even as she told me during the past night. I will serve my Lady Mary, and I will minister unto her with a service that is twice as great as thine. And behold, thou shalt find punishment and tribulations because of the evil of thy actions. And if my Lady Mary will help me, I will petition my Lord Jesus Christ, her beloved Son, to avenge me on thee, and He shall punish thee in this world with suffering and sickness, and with fire in the world that is to come."" And when the woman heard the wife's voice she turned towards her, and threw herself down at her feet and said unto her, ""I swear unto thee that from this day I will never speak to thy husband, and that I will never embrace his body. And that thou mayest believe what I say I will go with thee to the church, and will take an oath to thee, so that from this day thy heart may no longer doubt."" And she went with her to the church and swore to her before the picture of our Lady Mary, and the people present were witnesses to her oath that she would never again associate with the man in the work of sin. And when the man heard what the woman had done, he repented of his sin and was sorry for what he had done, and he returned to his wife. All this took place through the entreaty of our Lady Mary, the mother of mercy, who never alloweth to be put to shame him that taketh asylum with her. Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933.

151,The woman from Rome whose daughter rose up on the anniversary of her death.,Europe probably,"<p>It is said that  the city of Rome has many churches of Our Lady, the Holy Virgin Maryam, Mariham, but one church from among them is greater than all the rest. It was the custom of Rome’s people to gather every year on the Feast of the Dormition of Our Lady Mary, in that church, the greatest one. Also, many people came from other cities to join Rome’s people and celebrate the great feast with singing and chanting. One of those nights, they lit many candles and were going around to all the churches built for Our Lady, the Holy Virgin Maryam, Mariham, carrying the candles in their hands while rejoicing and exulting with loud songs and prayers. </p>
<p>And there was, in that holy church [that night], a woman whose virgin  friend had died the year before. </p>
<p>And while the people were gathered in that greatest holy church, that woman saw her friend, who had died previously, standing in the midst of the people in the church at the time of prayer. And due to the massive throng of people, she was unable to speak to her friend, but she knew that this was her friend who had died previously. Due to this, she was greatly amazed! </p>
<p>She said to herself, “I will go and stand at the church gates. And when my friend goes out with all the people I will be able to speak to her.” </p>
<p>While standing there [waiting], the woman saw her friend departing. So she grabbed her and said to her publicly, “Aren’t you my friend so and so?”  </p>
<p>And the friend replied, “Yes, I am.” </p>
<p>And that woman said to her friend, “Aren’t you the one who died about a year ago?”</p>
<p>And the friend replied, “Yes, I am.” </p>
<p>And that woman said to her friend, “Who brought you back to life and brought you here?” </p>
<p>And the friend who had died replied, “I will explain it to you--when I was in my youth, playing with [other] children, I fell into sin.  But, I did not confess my sin and did not repent concerning what I had done. So, when I died, they [that is, the angels of darkness,] brought me to the Great Judgment. And when this Blessed Feast [tonight] arrived, My Lady, the Holy Virgin Maryam, Mariham, came and beseeched her Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, petitioning him on my behalf and on behalf of all who were there with me in judgment. And she saved us. Now, due to our abundant rejoicing upon our deliverance on this Blessed Feast, all of us have come so that we might go around the churches and perform thanksgiving to and praise of Our Lady, the Holy Virgin Mary, Mariham, Mother of Mercy. If you don’t believe what I have told you, you’ll live just one more year and then die.”  </p>
<p>The friend gave the woman this report and then disappeared from sight. </p>
<p>And that good woman went home, put on the coarse cloth [of humility],  and [devoted herself to] praying, fasting, doing good deeds, and giving all her possessions as charity to the poor. </p>
<p>When one year had passed, on the third day before the Feast of the Dormition of Our Lady, the Holy Virgin Mary, Mariham, that woman became sick and died, just as her friend had told her. She passed into the mercy of God on the day of the Feast of the Dormition of Our Lady Maryam, Mariham. While the people were in the church, singing and chanting [for the feast], they carried that woman with great respect and buried her. And they increased their praise of Our Lady, the Holy Virgin Mary, Mariham, The Merciful, The Intercessor, The Maker of Miracles and Wonders. </p>

152,The widow who prayed to Saint Mary and saved her only son from death by hanging.,Europe confirmed,"[2 versions, Europe Ebbo the Thief it seems?] XXX THE VIRGIN MARY AND THE WIDOW'S SON WHO BECAME A THIEF [A. Fol. 66a, 1; B. Fol. 32a, 1 and 2.] NOW there was a certain poor widow who had one son, and besides him she had no other child. And every day she used to come to the church and stand up before the picture of our holy Lady, the two fold Virgin, and say, ""O my Lady, I commit this my son unto thy safe keeping, so that thou mayest guard him, for I have no other child besides him""; and in these words she used to pray daily. And it came to pass that, when her son had grown up and become a hale young man, he fell into the company of thieves, and became a robber. Now after a little time [the watch men] caught that young man and the other thieves who were with him, and brought them before the magistrate of the city, who passed a sentence of doom upon them; and [the guards"" crucified them according to the law of their city. And the mother of the young man did not know that all this had happened to her son, and as she was going in through the gates of the church, the neighbours told her, and said unto her, ""Knowest thou not that they have crucified thy son, together with the other thieves?"" And she said unto them, ""I did not know it""; and straightway she cried out with a loud cry, and she wept bitterly. And she went and stood up before the picture of our holy Lady, Mary, the two fold Virgin, the God-bearer, and she lifted up her eyes and said, ""Where is he whom I committed unto thy safe keeping? Where is the pledge which I deposited with thee, O my Lady? Behold, they have seized my son, together with the other thieves, and they have crucified him. So now, if thou wilt not deliver my son and save him, I will snatch thy Son out of thy bosom."" And at that same moment there was a great outcry, and many people came thronging into the church through the gates. Now when the widow heard the outcry, she turned round, and she saw her son coming in with the people, and she ran and embraced him. Then the people who were gathered together said unto him, ""What hath happened unto thee? And how wast thou saved?"" And the young man said unto them, ""When they had suspended me upon the wood, and were about to drive the nails into me, there came unto me a woman who was most beautiful in form, and who was shining with a light that was brighter than that of the sun, and she held back the nails so that they did not touch my flesh. Then she took me down from upon the wood, and said unto me, Get thee to the church, and to thy mother, for she wisheth to snatch my Son from my bosom in thy stead."" Then the people ascribed praise and glory unto God, the Glorious and Most High, and they gave thanks unto our holy Lady, Mary, the twofold Virgin, the God-bearer. And the woman and her son ministered in the church of our holy Lady until their death. Another version reads: It is said that there was a certain man who was a thief and a robber of churches, and that inasmuch as he was a man of evil habit and life he stole things from them daily; and all the people were lying in wait to catch him. And it came to pass one day that he carried off some of the possessions of our Lady Mary, according to his wont, and the people caught that thief, and beat him, and bound him in fetters and chains, and they planned to kill him. And he said, ""I place my trust in our holy Lady, the twofold Virgin, Mary, for whosoever believeth in her prayers shall be saved from all sorrow."" Then our holy Lady appeared in visible form to the men who had beaten him, and had laid hands upon him to kill him; and she said unto them, ""Release him."" And they released him by the command of our holy Lady, Mary the twofold Virgin, and set him free from his fetters, and all the people marvelled at her mercy. Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933. One Hundred and Ten Miracles of Our Lady Mary, pp. 98-100. London: Oxford University Press, H. Milford. XXXI THE VIRGIN MARY AND THE LADY EUPHEMIA [A. Fol. 67a, 1.] NOW there was a certain woman in the city of Samer whose name was Euphemia, and she was stricken in years and lived in great poverty. And she had one son, and besides him she had no other child, either son or daughter; and she loved this son exceedingly, and with her very soul. Each day, without fail, she was wont to go to the church of our Lady Mary with her son, whose name was Philemon, and pray to her for him, that she would take his soul under her protection, and would keep him from all evil, and would deliver him from all the distress that is set in this world. And she used to pray continually in the church, and she never failed to go there, and to pray on behalf of her son and to make supplication with a ready heart. And it came to pass that when Philemon, the son of this poor old woman, was moved by hunger and want of clothes, and poverty came upon him and he found himself in want, he joined himself to a company of thieves and robbers. And one day when he was plundering the house of a certain rich man in Alexandria, together with the thieves who were his companions, the menservants of the house of the rich man heard the noise of their feet on the third floor above, and they raised the alarm. Then the people of the city came to their help, and they seized Philemon and the [other] thieves, and they brought an accusation against him, and then they hanged him upon a sycamore-fig tree; and he remained hanging there for three days and three nights without eating food or drinking water. Now at the end of three days they told his mother. And it came to pass that when she heard this she cried out with a loud voice, and she went to the church, and called upon the name of our Lady Mary, and said unto her, ""Behold, my son whom I committed to thy care hath been cast away, and he hath been destroyed for nought. Now therefore, give me back my son, and redeem thou him by the might of thy Son; if thou lovest my son thou canst deliver him, for thou hast the power to do whatsoever thou wishest. Thou art the Mother of the Word of God Who became man through thee, and He hath delivered us from our Enemy, Satan, and He will consent to do what thou sayest, and will grant thee thy command, for there is none who can resist thee. Of His own freewill and by the good pleasure of His Father, He came and took up His abode in thy womb, and whatsoever thou askest Him He will give unto thee, O thou who art the boast of the race of the children of men, O thou who art the Bridge of the sons of men, O thou who art full of grace, God, in Whom there is neither division nor diminution, is with thee, and through the might of Jesus Christ, thy beloved Son our Lord, thou hast the power and the strength to do. Now therefore, O my Lady, if thou wilt not cause my son Philemon to come back, and wilt not bring him to me here, where shall I be able to find him? And in that I have committed him to thy care I have destroyed mine own son in mine own lifetime. And behold, I will take thy Son out of thy bosom in the place of mine own son Philemon."" And having said these words she set out to go to the image of our Lady in order to carry out the determination that she had formed in her mind. And straightway, on that selfsame day, Mary took a strong pole in the form of a branch of a tree, on the top of which was [fastened] a strong, curved knife, and she cut off the branch of the sycamore-fig tree upon which the son of the widow was hanging, and she set him free from his fetters. Then straightway the young man rose up, and went and walked among the crowd of people and arrived speedily at the church. Now his mother heard the noise of the multitude of people as they were coming in through the door of the church, and when she turned and saw her son among the people who were crowding in to enter through the door of the church, she ran towards him, like a woman who had gone mad, by reason of her exceedingly great joy at the sight of her son. And she seized him with her hands, like a savage lioness, and she hugged his neck, and kissed his mouth, and said unto him, ""O my son, tell me where thou hast been. Behold, for three days and three nights I have been dying for a sight of thy face; oh, I beseech thee to tell me where thou hast been! Who hath given thee bread to eat? Who hath given thee water to drink? O my son, tell me."" Then her son cried out with a loud voice before all the people and said, ""Behold, I was hanging for three days and three nights from a sycamore fig tree, but our Lady Mary fed me with heavenly food, and gave me to drink of the water of life. More over, she brought me down from the fig tree and sent me away, and said unto me, ""Go unto thy mother in peace."" And when the people who were there, that is to say, men, and women, and children, and old men and young men, and children and old women, heard this, they glorified God and ascribed great praise unto Him. And they praised our Lady Mary exceedingly, and likewise gave thanks unto her, and they sang hymns and praises unto the Word of God, and they cried unto Him joyfully, and shouted with gladness in honour of our Lady Mary, because of the wonderful and miraculous thing that she had done. And it came to pass that when the Bishop, Abba Benyami, heard these praises and glorifyings of Mary, he summoned all the people and made them come unto him, and then he enquired concerning the youth and his mother, and concerning the miracle which our Lady Mary had made manifest that day. Then he took the youth and his mother, and established them in his own house, and because of the honour in which he held the holy Virgin Mary he provided them with their food and their apparel, until he died. O thou beautiful Mother of the King Who redeemed us, As thou didst aforetime deliver the widow's son who was a thief, So, O Mary the Virgin, mayest thou earnestly desire my deliverance! May mine enemy [be turned back] until he gnasheth with his teeth, And send thou against him a devil that shall torture him! Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933.

153,The young man who used to bring roses to the icon of Saint Mary.,Levant confirmed (Constantinople),"X THE VIRGIN MARY AND THE YOUTH ZECHARIAH [A. Fol. 20b, 1; B. Fol. 242a, 1.] NOW there was a certain youth in the city of Rome (Constantinople) who was of noble birth, and his name was Zechariah; and he was handsome in appearance. And it came to pass that on a certain day he went into a church to pray, and he saw there a picture of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, which pleased him exceedingly; and his heart burned as with fire by reason of the ardour of his love for her. And he meditated within himself and said, ""What gift that will be acceptable unto her can I offer unto her?"" And forth with he took fifty roses, and made them into the form of a crown, and he fastened them to the picture over the head [of the Virgin]. Now when the days of roses had come to an end, he was exceedingly sorry, because he lacked the wherewithal to make an offering to present unto her. Then he went into the church and stood up before the picture of our holy Lady, the Virgin two fold, Mary, and said unto her, ""O my beloved Lady, thou knowest that the days for roses are passed and gone. But I wish to present unto thee [something] each day, and I will therefore give unto thee fifty salutations instead of the fifty roses."" So each day he recited the words, ""Hail to thee, O my Lady, rejoice thou with joy, for God is with thee!"" And he continued to recite these salutations each day until he grew up, when he departed unto another city. And when he was journeying through a terrible wilderness—now thieves dwelt therein and used to lie in wait [for travellers] and he was afraid lest he might fall into their hands—he remembered that he had not re cited the salutation of the angel, and he went forth into the wilderness to pray. And it came to pass that the captain of the thieves saw him and followed him, so that he might see what Zechariah was about to do. And when Zechariah had come into the wilderness he turned his face towards the East, and he lifted up his eyes to heaven, and knelt down upon his knees on the ground. Now when he knelt down, the captain of the thieves* saw a lady come down from heaven with great glory, and there were beautiful virgins with her. And they set a seat for her, and she sat down in front of Zechariah; and every time he spake a rose came forth from his mouth. And our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, rose up and took him to her bosom until she had received fifty roses from him; now the captain of the thieves counted the roses and he saw them with his own eyes. And it came to pass that when Zechariah had finished his prayer, our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, laid her hand upon his head, and having blessed him she went up into heaven with the virgins. And the captain of the thieves marvelled at what he had seen, and turned away into the wilderness. Then Zechariah turned to continue his journey, and straightway the thieves rose up against him and seized him. And the captain of the thieves said unto him, ""Tell me how thou didst send away those beautiful women, and what thou hast done with them."" And Zechariah said unto him, ""I am a sinful man, but I know nothing whatsoever of any beautiful women. But I used to offer as a gift each day to our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-bearer, fifty salutations, saying, 'Rejoice, O thou who art full of grace, for God is with thee.' "" Then the captain of the thieves made known unto Zechariah everything [which he had seen], and he said, ""From this day I will turn to repentance, and I will serve the Lady of us all, the holy woman, the Virgin twofold, Mary, all the days of my life""; and thus also spoke all the thieves. And they sent Zechariah away on his journey, and he departed in peace. And afterwards the thieves repented and became monks, and they served our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, all the days of their life. The young man Zechariah instead of fifty roses Presented words of praise when he made an offering unto thee.

154,The two women who were attacked by robbers on their way to church.,Europe confirmed,"XI THE VIRGIN MARY AND THE WOMEN JULIANA AND BARBARA [A. Fol. 23a, 1 ; B. Fol. 50a.] NOW there were two handmaidens of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, who gave birth to God in Bethlehem of the children of Judah; the name of the one was Juliana, and the name of the other was Barbara. And one day, as they were going to Jerusalem to worship at the Festival of the Departure of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, they were attacked in the village of Rosmaduk by thieves who took away their food from them. And it came to pass that, when the thieves had divided the bread that they had taken away from them, they began to eat it among themselves. And as each one of them put a morsel of it into his mouth and began to eat, straightway their front teeth and their grinders became broken, and their mouths were filled with pieces of broken teeth, and the insides of their mouths and their throats were cut deeply by them ; and they could not speak and were nigh unto death. And those who saw and heard this miracle marvelled greatly and were astonished, and by reason of their terror and awe of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, fear and trembling entered into their hearts. Then the thieves went and repented, and they forsook their evil deeds, and they entreated forgiveness of their sins from our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, and they gave unto Juliana and Barbara each a double portion of goods in return for their food which they had carried off. And our Lady, the store house of mercy, spared them, and restored their teeth to the condition in which they were aforetime; for she is able to do all things, and there is nothing which she cannot do, and she is a worker of miracles and wonders. May her prayer, and her blessing, and the mercy of her beloved Son, be with our King David for ever and ever! Amen. Thy power, O Mary, hath broken the tooth of our sin.

And she was wont to bless the Virgin, saying, ""Blessed art thou, 0 Mary! How didst thou bring forth the One, thy Son, the Word of God, the joy of celestial and terrestrial beings? Blessed art thou who didst carry the Word of God in thine arms and in thy womb, and didst suckle Him at thy breasts, and didst carry Him upon thy shoulders! Blessed are thine eyes which saw Him, and blessed is he who saw her joy on that day!"" And whilst she. was thinking thus in her heart, a most beautiful Child appeared to her, and His face shone and He stretched out His hands to her. And the woman pushed the Child from her, for she was praying, and she thought that He was one of the children who were in the church with their parents. And when she drew her hand away from Him, the Boy opened His mouth and said unto her, ""Thou prayest and entreatest to see My day, and thou makest request to My Mother continually: I have come to thee and thou wilt neither receive Me nor lift Me up."" And when the good woman heard His speech she turned towards Him quickly and looked at His Face, and it was shining like the sun; and at that moment He disappeared from her. And that woman fell down and became like a dead body, and she was not able to speak to [any] man. And when her understanding returned to her, and she had risen up out of her dazed state (literally, drunkenness), she shed tears that were like unto coals of fire. And she wept, and lamented and said, ""Woe is my soul, for my God, and my beloved One, and my Redeemer came to me, and I did not recognize Him. And I did not carry Him in my bosom, and I did not fill my eyes with my tears at the sight of Him; even thus did He find the lazy folk who do not serve God.""

Fol. 52a.] AND there was a certain handsome young man who loved our Lady Mary with all his heart and with all his mind, and he went to a monastery so that he might take counsel with himself, and he remained [there] for a year. And when that period had passed, the Archimandrite said unto him, ""O my son, it is fit ting that thou shouldst do one of two things: Thou shouldst either take up thine abode in the monastery among the brethren, and ascribe blessing to thyself that thou wilt be able to serve Him all the days of thy life, or thou shouldst go forth [from us]."" And when the young man heard the Archimandrite's words, he went into the church, and lifted up his eyes to God—may He be praised!—and besought Him to give him good counsel, and counsel whereby the salvation of his soul would be brought about. And as he was standing in the church among the brethren, slumber seized him, and he saw as it were a garden planted in a desert place, wherein there were trees of every kind, and flowers, and fruits, and upon the trees were birds of every kind, each one singing his own particular note, and their warblings were such as to rejoice the heart of a man. And the forms and appearances of them led captive the sight, and their plumage glistened like the light and like the topaz. And the young man saw in that garden a palace whereof the walls were built, outside and inside, with precious stones; and it was inlaid with gold, and silver, and emerald stones, and it shone like the sun. And the odour of the perfume cured every disease and healed every sickness. And when he drew nigh unto that palace he heard coming forth from it a beautiful voice which charmed the hearts of men. And as he was thinking thus concerning it there came forth from that palace young men who were like unto shining stars, and they were arrayed in white apparel which was worked with gold and silver. And after them there came forth beautiful virgins, each one arrayed in her own special apparel and wearing precious gems; and after them went forth our Lady Mary shining more brightly than the sun and moon. And when they went forth into the garden they set for her a throne the like of which man had never seen, and our Lady Mary sat down upon it and looked round to the right and to the left. And she saw the young man and commanded [the virgins] to bring him to her; and when he came before her she said unto him, ""Who art thou?"" And he said unto her, ""I am a poor man."" And she said unto him, ""Dost thou wish to serve me?"" And he said unto her, ""I am a poor man, and thou art a great Lady, and thou canst have no plea sure in my becoming thy servant."" And she said unto him, ""I am well pleased that thou shouldst serve me""; and he bowed low before her and departed. And as he was going away he turned and looked behind him, and she commanded them to bring him back. And when he came back she said unto him, ""Why didst thou turn and look behind thee?"" And he said unto her, ""O my Lady, I wondered who thou wast and what was thy name."" And she said unto him, ""Dost thou not know me, seeing that I am with you and that the memorial of me is among you at all times? Hast thou not heard the name of Mary, the mother of Jesus Christ?""

158,The abbess who became pregnant after sinning with a servant.,Europe confirmed (France),"XXV THE VIRGIN MARY AND SOPHIA, ABBESS OF MOUNT CARMEL [A. Fol. 50a, 1; B. Fol. 47b, 1.] NOW there was a certain Abbess of the Monastery of Mount Carmel whose name was Sophia; she was a God-fearing woman, and she was very beautiful in form, and she loved our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, with her whole heart. And she had under her charge in that monastery a large number of virgins and women who were vowed to the ascetic life, and she taught them the rules and ordinances of the life of nuns, and strictly admonished them continually not to speak words of lightness and not to be slothful in observing the seasons of prayer. And for these reasons they hated her, and they awaited eagerly the happening of some scandal in her time so that they might remove her from her position. And there was in the monastery a certain young man, who was a servant and who attended to the food and clothing of the virgins, and Satan being jealous of the Abbess cast into her heart the lust of the flesh, and she committed fornication with that serving man and became with child by him. And this thing became manifest to the nuns, and they knew that the Abbess had conceived; and they went and made an accusation against her to the Bishop, whose name was Abba Severus, and informed him that the Abbess had become with child. Now when the Bishop heard this he sent a messenger unto the Abbess saying that the virgins were to be gathered together on a certain day, and that he would come to inspect them. And when the Abbess heard the words of the messenger she was terrified, and she knew that the virgins had laid an accusation against her. Then she went quickly into the church and prostrated herself before the picture of our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, the God-bearer. And she wept with a bitter weeping and a burning heart, and she said, ""O thou who lovest mercy and compassion, make soft thy heart towards thy sinful handmaiden who hath been entrapped in a snare, and show lovingkindness unto her, and do away the wickedness which I bear in my womb, and put me not to open shame, O my Lady."" Now through the abundance of her weeping she became ex hausted and fell asleep, and she saw in her sleep our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, come to her, having two angels with her. And she said unto the Abbess, ""Be not thou sorrowful, for behold, I have made supplication to my Son to forgive thee thy sin, but thou must never commit the sin again."" Then our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, said unto the two angels, ""Take ye away the child that is in her womb, and give it unto the man whose name is Pilkes (Felix), so that he may take it under his protection and suckle it, for he possesseth much cattle."" And the angels did as our Lady com manded them. Then the Abbess awoke from her sleep, and felt her womb and found that the child was not there. And she gave thanks unto our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-bearer, with her whole heart because of the miracle which she had wrought for her, and she went forth to her work according to her wont. And it came to pass that at the appointed season the Bishop arrived, and he entered into the abode of the virgins, and the Abbess met him, having with her one of the nuns who had made the accusation against her. Then the Bishop asked the Abbess how it was that she had become with child by fornication, and she denied it, saying, ""I have not done this thing."" And the Bishop commanded the oldest of the women to examine the Abbess, and to find out whether she was with child or not; and when they had examined her they found no trace of conception in her womb, and they thought that she was a virgin who had never known man. Then they told the Bishop this thing, but he did not believe them, and thought that, having taken a bribe from the Abbess, they were concealing her transgression for her. And the Bishop rose up, and with him there were priests, and deacons, and women who were devoted to the ascetic life, and they examined the body of the Abbess, but they did not find a child therein. Then straightway the Bishop repented with a great repentance, because he had reproached the Abbess without just cause, and he turned to those virgins who had made the accusation against the Abbess, and was wroth with them because they had accused her of shameful conduct. Now when the Abbess saw that the Bishop was angry she was afraid lest those virgins would be expelled and sent away and led into captivity by Satan through her. And straightway she rose up and said unto all the company, ""Depart ye from the Bishop for a season""; and she told him all her transgressions, and openly confessed to him what she had done in secret. And besides this she told him how our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-bearer, had appeared unto her, and how the two angels had taken the child from her womb, and how they had given him to a certain man to be suckled and reared. Now when the Bishop heard these things from the Abbess he marvelled exceedingly, and he sent a message unto the man, whose name was Felix, and who had perceived the miracle, to come and bring the child with him; and Felix came and brought the child with him. And it came to pass that when he arrived the Bishop questioned him closely about the child, and Felix told him, saying, ""Two young men of most goodly appearance came unto me and said, Our Lady Mary saith unto thee: Take this child and keep him with thee, and suckle him and rear him; then they gave me the child, and disappeared from me, and behold, this is the child."" And when the Bishop heard him he marvelled greatly, and he took the child and kept him in his own house, and he provided him with everything that was required by a child of his age. And when the boy had grown up he taught him the Psalms of David, and read to him stories of the Saints; and the Holy Spirit came upon him in abundance, and the love of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, was with him in full measure. Now after the death of Abba Severus the Bishop, they appointed the young man Bishop in his stead, and seated him upon [his] throne; and he was a good shepherd all the days of his life, and he died in peace. Mary is the Sanctuary of the Law, and she is the Evangelist, and the abode Of the Paraclete Who visited her.

Fol. 20b.] AND there was a monastery in a certain town, wherein there was a God-fearing widow who cleaned the church, and she attended to the altar of our Lady Mary, and she saluted her, and worshipped her, and prayed unto her at all times from the depth of her heart. And Satan, the enemy of spiritual excellence and the virtues, was envious of her. Now there was a certain monk who used to come to the church wherein that woman was, and Satan caused the remembrance of sin to be pleasant to them, and they loved each other with a sinful love. And Satan worked upon them until at length the man said to the widow, ""I am dying through the excess of my love for thee."" And when the widow heard his words she said, ""As for me, I cannot sleep at all at night because of my great love for thee. Show me what thou wilt do so that we may meet in some place, and let us go away alone together into another town."" And they agreed together that he should come to her at midnight, and that they should go away to another town. And when the time that they agreed upon arrived, he came to her. And when the widow saw him she rose up quickly, and she took the key of the church and went to the picture of our Lady Mary, and said, ""My Lady, I cannot endure, it being too great for me, and I beseech thee to go with me""; and she laid the key on the altar. And she went away with the monk to another town, and they fell into sin for four years, and no child of theirs lived. And when they saw this thing they were sorrowful, and were troubled and angry by day and by night. And she said unto him, ""All this is through thy sin. Thou didst bring me out of my nunnery, and didst thyself abandon thy monastic life. Woe be unto thee before thy Creator as the author of my sin""; and the man spake unto her in similar words. And one day she said unto him, ""I wish to go back to my nunnery, and to repent of my sin,"" and they agreed together to go back, and so they returned to the town whence they had come. And the widow went to the district round about the nunnery and she asked the neighbours there, saying, ""What do people say about that woman who attends to the church?"" And they said unto her, ""They say that she is an excellent woman, virtuous and holy""; and when she heard this she knew that the matter was from our Lady. And she waited until midnight, the time she had come out, and then went into the church, and she found our Lady Mary standing in the church and the key with her; and the widow bowed down before her and she took the key from her hands. And our Lady Mary said unto her, ""Sin not again as thou hast sinned, and I will entreat my Son to forgive thee."" And the widow went to her chamber and found her apparel there, and she changed her garments and returned to her service. And when the dawn came she went about among her sisters in fear and trembling, seeing how great a sin she had committed, but she found none who reproached her or who uttered a word of offence to cause pain to her heart. And she rejoiced greatly, and she ministered to our Lady Mary. And afterwards she confessed her sin, and was consoled, for by purity a man obtaineth salvation; and when she died she went into the kingdom of heaven.

Fol. 22a.] THERE was a certain man who possessed very many bees, and he wished to have a yield from them which was greater than that of any other beekeeper. And he went to a certain woman who was a sorceress, and he said unto her, ""I entreat thee to advise me and to tell me what I am to do so that I may have more honey and more wax by far than any other beekeeper."" And that sorceress said unto him, ""I will advise thee. When thou art receiving the Offering, expel it from thy mouth and put it into thy hive, and then thou shalt have abundant honey and wax."" And on the following day he rose up early, and went to the church, and received the Offering, and even as the woman told him he took it out of his mouth and put it among the bees. And he waited one hour and returned to the bees, and he saw in the beehive, at the place where he had laid the Offering, a great light. And there was a figure of our Lady Mary sitting in that beehive, and in her lap was a little Child who shone more brightly than the sun and was more beautiful than the moon. And when he saw this he was afraid with a great fear, and he went to the priest and told him all that he had done and seen; and the priest did not believe his words. And he sent a deacon and said unto him, ""Go with him and see what he will show thee."" And when the deacon went he saw what the man said he had seen, and he returned in fear and told the priest what he had seen. And when the priest was certain about the matter [he told] all the people, and he summoned them with joy and gladness. And when the priest arrived at the beehive, he saw the light and the Virgin and the Child in her lap. And he was exceedingly sorry. And he commanded the people to carry off the beehive and to set it upon the altar. And he took the figure and laid it upon the altar, and he began to recite the Office of the Eucharist, and at the moment when he broke the Offering, suddenly the image came down to the Offering, and the priest took the Holy Offering, and finished the consecration of the Offering with great reverence.

Fol. 13b, 1.] NOW there was a certain Hebrew in the city of Akhmim who loved our holy Lady, the Godbearer, from the depth of his heart, and the mention of her name, with fear and trembling, was never absent from his tongue; and when he bowed down before her he was wont to embrace the ground in honour of her name. And the man was a priest, and he ministered holily in the church at the time of [burning] incense and presenting the offering (i.e. Eucharist). And it came to pass that when the days of his youth had passed, his strength failed and he was unable to stand up. And when the Archbishop knew that he had become feeble and was not able to stand up, he appointed two deacons to minister with him and to give him assistance. Now one day whilst he was singing praises to the name of our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, the God-bearer, and was bowing down to her to the ground, he fell for ward upon his breast, and his backbone was broken. And he cried out with a loud voice, and said, ""O my Lady Mary, come thou and help me in my fall."" Then straightway our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, appeared unto him standing on the right side of the altar, and she stretched out her hand over him, and touched his backbone which was broken, and made it whole. And she made a sign to him to come and stand on the right-hand side of the altar where she was. And immediately he perceived this he rejoiced greatly, and he marvelled and was astonished at the beauty of her form, and at the splendour which was round about her; and his old age was renewed, and he became a vigorous young man [again]. And he continued to minister in the church unto our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, all his days; and she added unto the years of his life one hundred and thirty years; and all his days were two hundred and thirty years, and then he died in peace and departed unto everlasting life.

Now he did not write her name with common water of lampblack (i.e. black ink), but he wrote it with ink made of gold and silver, and with rose-coloured paint, and with divers splendid colours that were like unto them in beauty and in value. And when that scribe fell ill, and was nigh unto death, before his soul departed from his body our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, appeared unto him, and said unto him: ""O my faithful servant, art not thou he who instead of writing my name in common black ink hath done so with ink of gold and silver, and hath painted it with divers splendid colours that are like unto them in beauty and value, and hath decorated it and made it glorious with the best of thine ability?

Fol. 11a, 1; B. Fol. 16b, 1] NOW there was a certain Bishop of Rome who was called Abbas. He was a good and holy man, and he feared God Almighty and kept himself from unchastity and from meditation upon evil. And it came to pass that, one day during the festival [of the Virgin], when he was saying the prayer of consecration so that he might administer the Holy Mysteries to the people —now the people, both men and women, were in the habit at the time when they were about to receive the Holy Mysteries, before they prostrated themselves, of embracing the hands and the feet of the priest who was going to minister unto them—he smelt the odour of a certain woman as she was embracing his hands, and the unclean desire of the flesh entered into his heart, and he burned with the flame of lust. And after he had ended the Offering, he departed and went quickly into the chamber where the treasures belonging to the church were kept, and he took a knife and cut off his hand, and he began to weep. And it came to pass that while he tarried there the people in the sanctuary became very sad, and the priests and deacons went to him and said unto him: ""O master and governor of the people, we have waited long [for thee], and we are greatly distressed at thy tarrying""; and when they spake these words to him he wept the more. Then he rose up and went with them, and when he came before the picture of the holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, he fell down on his face before it, and he worshipped her and made supplication unto her, and entreated her to have mercy upon him, and to help him, and to pardon his sin. Then straightway our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, appeared unto him, and she took his hand [which he had cut off] in her holy hands, and rejoined it to the place from which it had been cut off, and it became whole even as it was aforetime, and no mark whatsoever of the cut could be found; then she disappeared from him. And when the priests and deacons saw this they marvelled and were silent. And they related this miracle to the people, and ascribed praise unto the glorious and Most High God, and gave thanks unto our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, who is able to perform all things, and who worketh miracles and doeth wonders. Now Abbas, a priest of Rome, Took a knife and cut off his hand, which caused him pain. As thou, O Mary, the sister of Salome, didst heal him of old, Even so do thou now heal the wound in my soul, and grant me rest Whensoever I invoke thy name, which giveth protection. Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933. One Hundred and Ten Miracles of Our Lady Mary, pp. 14-16. London: Oxford University Press, H. Milford. Va THE VIRGIN MARY AND LEO, BISHOP OF ROME [Brit. Mus. MS. Orient. No. 652, Fol. 82a.] THERE was a certain young man in the city of Rome who was a Muslim, and he was a survivor from the days of Islam [in that city]. And he used to go into a church, and stand before a picture of our Lady Mary, and salute her with salutations. And one day she spake unto him from out of her picture, and she said unto him, ""Why dost thou act thus, and come every day and pay me homage, not being one of the men of the Christian Faith?"" And he said unto her, ""I know that thou art the mother of God, and that thou canst deliver me from Sheol."" And she said unto him, ""Go thou to Father Leo, and he will help thee, and thou shalt be glad""; and he went to Father Leo. And Father Leo went out and he found the young man, and he said unto him, ""What dost thou want?"" And the young man said unto him, ""I wish thee to bring me back to the Christian Faith."" And Abba Leo baptized him, and called him by his own name, and he took him with him, and treated him as one of his children. And he handed him over to a teacher, and made him a deacon, and afterwards he made him a priest. When Abba Leo died, the people elected him to be their Abba in the room of Leo, for he was good and holy. And after he had been appointed Abba, one day he put on the Eucharistic vestments, and celebrated the Eucharist, and the congregation came and embraced his hands and his feet. And a few days later, a friend, a young woman, wished to go to him so that he might do her good, and she came to him with the [other] people, and she embraced his hand, and kissed it, and he was exceedingly angry. And having finished the celebration of the Eucharist, he went up on his couch and said, ""This hand of mine is defiled."" And he took a knife and cut it off, and he wrapped it in a cloth and set it down under his bed and went to sleep. And when the morning came, the people came to him and said, ""Come forth and officiate, for it is customary for a new Abba after his appointment to officiate for eight days without cessation""; and he said unto them, ""I cannot officiate to-day."" And they went away from him in anger saying each to the other, ""He is a pagan (Aramawi) and doth not wish to be Abba or to officiate."" And they went to him again on the third day, and said unto him, ""Officiate."" And he said unto them, ""I cannot."" And they said unto him, ""If thou wilt not officiate to-morrow they will set thee aside, and appoint another Abba in thy stead."" And he said unto them, ""Let them do as they please; I am well pleased that they should do this."" And at eventide he went down to the church, and stood up in front of the picture which had spoken unto him, and he said unto it, ""O my compassionate Lady, who didst show thy mercy and compassion unto me being unworthy of this gift, thou knowest how I have cut off my hand."" And the picture said unto him, Thou art a man without understanding and hast cut off thy hand. Knowest thou not that repentance cleanseth from sin? From to-day thou must never do such a thing again. Take this new hand which God hath given thee. And she fastened upon him a hand which was bright like the sun, and which sent forth light into all the place, and he rejoiced and was glad. And he gave thanks unto our Lady Mary who had shown favour unto him from first to last, and he went up into his bed and slept until daybreak. And at daybreak he went down to the church, and arrayed himself in the Eucharistic vestments, and when he raised his hand, there shot forth from it a light like that of the sun. And all those who looked at it were frightened, and all those who were in the church marvelled at this thing. And when he had finished the Office he went up upon his couch. And the bishops said unto him, ""Tell us what is this thing which we saw from thy hand to-day."" And he said unto them, ""Verily I tell you that my Lady Mary, the merciful one, gave me this hand. It is not a hand made of the earth""; and then he took up the hand which he had cut off [from under his bed] and showed it to them. And they marvelled at this thing and glorified God and gave thanks to our Lady Mary, who showeth acts of grace to those who serve her, and helpeth them in the time of their tribulation. Budge, E. A.

He quickly retired to the church’s store room and cut off his hand with a knife. Wondering what kept the bishop so long, the priests and deacons called to him. Abbas came out weeping, and he fell before an icon of Mary, to whom he prayed for mercy. Mary appeared, restored Abbas’s hand, and disappeared again without speaking. The priests and deacons who witnessed this miracle marveled and spread word of what they had seen.
In the city of Rome there was a young Muslim man who frequently stood before an icon of the Virgin Mary and saluted her. One day Mary spoke from the icon and asked the young man why he, a Muslim, came before her. He expressed his wish to convert, and on Mary’s instructions he went to see Abbâ Leo |sp|, who baptized him. The young man later became a priest, and when Abbâ Leo died, he took the deceased man’s place. One day a woman came to the new abbâ for help, and she took his hand and kissed it. He immediately retired to his couch and, declaring that his hand had been defiled, he cut it off with a knife. In the morning, his congregation called him to come out and officiate, but he refused. The congregation called for him the next day, and when he refused again, the people promised remove him from office if he did not officiate the following day. That evening he prayed for mercy before an icon of Mary. Speaking through the image, Mary reproached the abbâ, but showed mercy by restoring his hand. The next morning he officiated, and when he raised his hand, a bright light shot forth from it. Later, the abbâ told the bishops how Mary had restored his severed hand. The bishops marveled.","The Muslim whom Saint Mary told to receive baptism.

165,The sinful woman who despaired when she kept on sinning and swallowed a scorpion.,,"<p>There was a sinful woman who had committed great sins. Her greatest fault of all was the following: after having repented, she returned again to her prior conduct. Her sins were elevated above the sins of men and she had lost belief in God.</p>
<p>The spirit of an impure demon stayed upon her to the point where she wished to kill herself, to smash her own head and shred her own stomach.</p>
<p>But the angel which was upon her protected her and the woman [she] believed in the release [sortie] of her soul and bitter death.</p>
<p>Because of this, she was trembling and afraid of the impure spirit that was upon her.</p>
<p>One day, her soul and her body were irritated. She went beside the trees and the stones that were in the villages and on the squares [places], in the streets and crossroads, in the deserts and on the mountains and hills. She encountered a cruel scorpion.</p>
<p>She took it and swallowed it. Its venom spread in her stomach, all her entrails were agitated and she was covered in ulcers. She kept in her chest the scorpion, and was taken with a great malady and was close to dying.</p>
<p>There was in her home a tablet and, painted on this, the image of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary Mother of God. The woman[she] asked the people in her home to bring her the icon of Our Lady Mary Mother of God with her beloved Son, which had been deposited in her treasure. She loved Our Lady, served her since her childhood and honored her festival.</p>
<p>She submitted herself with a valiant heart to Our Lady the Holy Virgin.</p>
<p>While she was lying on the pavement [pavé] (?) and rolling in ash, she took the icon of Our Lady, placed her on her stomach and said, “O my Lady loved by men, I beg you to heal me and to help me escape from these torments of this painful malady.”</p>
<p>As she said that, a voice came from the icon of Our Lady and said to her, “Go beside the archpriest of this church; he stays in this town [ville], he is a priest and a good man of the name Jean: open yourself to him. </p>
<p>‘Tell him all the sins that you have committed since your childhood until today and say to him, ‘Our Lady the Mother of God sent me to you to confess the sins that I committed before the eyes of God.</p>
<p>‘By my shameless conduct, this malady has affected me. Because of the number of sins that I committed, an impure spirit stayed upon me, made me crazy and made me find a scorpion in the villages, in the squares [places] and in the deserts. And I found a little scorpion and I swallowed it.</p>
<p>‘It spit its venom into my stomach. Numerous scorpions were conceived there and my stomach has grown to the point of bursting. By the injection of its venom, the scorpion has made me ulcerous, my stomach was inflated and revolted [révulsé] (?).</p>
<p>‘Day and night, torment, great misery and groaning of the heart have touched me.’”</p>
<p>The woman told all her sins to the archpriest Jean. He welcomed her for Mary his [sa] Mother.</p>
<p>Next he raised his hand and touched the woman on the head; he recited on her the prayer of Our Lady Mary and gave her back [lui remit] her sins. The impure spirit moved aside from her and went to a hidden place.</p>
<p>The same day, the pain of the delivery took the woman; she birthed forty scorpions, large and small, and was healed of her malady.</p>
<p>Those who saw this miracle were amazed and stupefied. They glorified God and returned grace [rendirent grâce] to Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary mother of God, the dispenser of clemency: she lightens the charge of those who are in difficulty.</p>
<p>After that, the archpriest gave to the woman a penance in proportion to what she had done, according to the law of Sinodos as was established by the holy apostles .</p>
<p>He exhorted her with all the teaching that was in the pure Scriptures, that which is forever profitable for the generations to come. The woman was cured by a good [belle] conduct. She was sanctified by the love of Our Lady Mary the Mother of God.</p>
<p>When she died and quit this transitory world, she entered in the kingdom of the skies by the intercession of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary mother of God, because she had been named Elect [appellee élue].[Translation as of 05/21/22]</p>

Mus. MS. Orient. No. 652. Fol. 27a.] THERE was a certain wise monk [ṭabib in Arabic means physician; it means wise in Ge'ez] in a monastery, and he pondered in his mind about the green herbs which the monks ate, and he thought that they would die through suffering from diverse pains. And one day whilst they were sitting together at the table, men brought in the food which was not to be eaten that day, and the monks ate thereof. And when that monk saw them eating he said within himself, ""None of these men will live a year."" And as he was thinking thus, behold, suddenly he saw the Virgin among the monks, and her face was shining brighter than the sun in the heavens and the stars. And with her were the virgins who ministered unto her, and they had with them a vase wherein was a health-giving substance the like of which no eye had ever seen, and of the sweetness of the perfume of which no ear had ever heard. And that Virgin began to take it out of the vase with a spoon, and she placed one spoonful in the mouth of each of the monks, beginning at the lower end of the table and proceeding to the higher. And when she came to that wise man and he opened his mouth to receive a spoonful like his brethren, she prevented him and would not give him any, and she said, ""His wisdom shall be profitable for this man, but for the poor [this] health-giving substance is their father."" And when the wise man heard this word he knew at once that the Virgin was our Lady Mary, and he was wroth with himself and was sorry for what he had done, and henceforward he ate with a pure heart what they brought to him. And when the monks saw this they marvelled, and asked him questions about it and he told them what he had seen and heard. And they praised God and gave thanks unto our Lady Mary, who neglecteth not her servants and protecteth those who trust in her. Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933.

Fol. 28b.] THERE was a certain noble lady who lived upon an island in the sea (or, river), and she was one of the great ones of the town, and her kinsfolk were of high degree; and she had a husband who was also one of the great ones of the town. And that noble lady went to make her confession to the priest, and when the priest saw her arrayed in purple and wearing ornaments of gold and silver, and jewels of great price, he said unto her, ""O my daughter, thou must know that rich apparel induceth pride which destroyeth the soul. I will tell thee that which shall be profitable for thy soul, and that is, Give alms to the poor, and the needy, and the helpless, and the churches, and there shall be treasure for thee in heaven."" And when that woman heard the voice of the priest, she went and did as he had com manded her, and she gave her jewels to the poor and her apparel to the church. Now she loved our Lady Mary with all her heart. And when her husband saw what she had done he was sorrowful and would not speak to her. And when the festival of our Lady Mary arrived, that which was in commemoration of her entrance into the Sanctuary, she said unto her husband, ""I wish to go to the church."" And when he heard her words he chided her and said unto her, ""What will it profit thee to go to church among all the great people of the town? They are adorned with apparel of purple, and with gold and silver ornaments, and with raiment of fine linen, whilst thou, poor miserable creature, hast neither gold nor silver [brocade], having wasted thy money in alms. Every one who seeth thee in thy miser able rags will curse me."" And he swore by God, saying, ""Thou shalt not leave thy house and go to the church."" And when she heard the words of her husband she was sad, and she said, ""How can [I let] pass this great and glorious festival, which is blessed because God hearkeneth to the prayer which is prayed with Christian people?"" And she wept scalding tears with sorrow of heart, and lifted up her eyes to our Lady Mary, and she sorrowed because of the passing of the festival of the Virgin. And through the greatness of her sorrow, and weeping, and sadness because she had not gone to the church she fell into a short sleep. And she beheld as it were a multitude of Christians, both men and women, coming down from heaven into the church, and behold, the priest wearing his holy and august vestments began to recite the prayers from the beginning to the end. And the priest was giving a wax candle to every one, but he did not give a candle to that woman. And when the priest saw that he had not given her a candle he told the deacon to give her one like everyone else; and the woman took the candle and rejoiced greatly. And when the consecration of the Eucharist came, the people embraced the hands of the priest and gave him the candles according to custom. And the woman wished to embrace the hands of the priest, for the light of his face was revealed, but she did not wish to give him the candle in her hand; and she approached the priest and embraced his hand. And the deacon wanted to take the candle out of her hand, but she held fast to it and would not let it go; and the deacon laid hold upon it, and strengthened his grip and the candle came in two pieces. And when the Office was ended, the priest pronounced the benediction and the congregation dispersed. And the woman awoke from her sleep, and she saw the wax candle in her hand, and she knew that the dream which she had seen was a thing which was real.

169,The rich merchant from Constantinople who lost all his money and made the icon of Saint Mary his guarantor when he borrowed money from a usurer.,Levant probably (Constantinople),"XLVII THE VIRGIN MARY BECOMES SECURITY FOR THE DEBT INCURRED BY A CERTAIN MERCHANT [Brit. Mus. MS. Orient. No. 652. Fol. 54a, No. 45.] THERE was in the city of Kuestentenya (Constantinople) a certain merchant who was very rich, and he had among the notables of the city a friend who loved him and embraced him. And one day the merchant said unto his friend, ""O my friend, I hold myself willing to help thee shouldst thou wish it""; and after three days he made him a feast according to his good pleasure. And after many days the horseman lost all his money, and he lacked the daily bread, for he had no other occupation and he knew no trade except horse manship. And he loved our Lady Mary with a right mind, and he trusted himself to her implicitly in his every matter, and in the time of his tribulation he placed his hope upon her. And by reason of his terrible plight he and the people of his house drew nigh unto death. And he went to a certain usurer, a Jew, and he asked him to give him money on usury. And the Jew said, ""I will give thee what thou wishest; give me a pledge."" And the knight said, ""I have none."" And the Jew said, ""Give me a security""; and the knight said, ""I will."" And he took the Jew to the church, and standing up before the image of our Lady Mary, he said unto him, ""This Lady and her Son will be security for me that I will repay thee thy gold by the day of her festival."" And the Jew, laughing at him, said, ""Behold, thou must give me a security upon whom I can rely for my money."" And he said unto the Jew, ""I will give thee my son. Take him, and if I do not pay thee back by the day of the festival of our Lady Mary, my son shall belong to thee."" And the Jew gave the knight what he wanted, and he departed on a journey, and he bought goods therewith; and he took pas sage in a ship and came to the city of Acco. And God brought him thither in peace and safety, and he sold everything that he had with him, and he made a very large profit thereon, gaining twelve dinars on every dinar. And he withdrew and set aside by itself the money that was owing to the Jew, and with the rest he trafficked, and then took a passage in a ship. And he asked the captain of the ship and said unto him, ""When will the festival of our Lady Mary take place?"" And the captain said unto him, ""Three days from to-day."" And again he asked the captain and said unto him, ""In how many days shall we reach port?"" And the captain said, ""Thou wilt arrive in thy city in ten days""; and the knight was exceedingly sad. Then he rose up forthwith, and took a box, and laid inside it the money belonging to that Jew, and he wrote on a piece of paper, which he placed inside the box, saying, ""This is the money [owing] to the Jew for which Mary the Virgin became security on behalf of the knight."" And he fastened up the box and cast it into the sea with confidence, and said, ""O my Lady Mary, I commit to thy care this money for which thou didst become security for me""; and the box arrived that night in the city of Constantinople. And when the morning had come, that Jew went out with his friends to walk about by the sea, and they saw that box, and his friends went down to the sea to take it up, but were unable to do so, for when they came near it to take it, the box withdrew seawards, and they were afraid [to follow it], and they came back. And the Jew himself, the owner of the money, stripped off his apparel and went down into the sea, and the box came towards him, and he took up the box, and came out of the sea, and opened it, and he found therein the gold and a paper whereon was written the name of the Jew. And he marvelled at this thing, and he took a little of the gold and gave it to his friends, and he said unto them, ""Make no mention of this matter""; and he took his money and hid it. And after ten days the horseman came to his city, and went into his house, but he neither went to the Jew nor spoke to him. And the Jew was wroth, and he took the son of the horseman and went to the governor, and the horseman made an accusation against him. And the governor called the Jew, and the Jew said unto the governor, ""My lord, I have a debt against him, and I hold his son in pledge, for he said to me, If the appointed time [for repayment] pass, and the money is unpaid, take my son."" And the horseman said, ""His money came to him even as we agreed together, and I have a witness concerning it."" And he took him to the church and brought him to the picture of our Lady Mary and said unto her, ""O my arbitress, thou knowest that thou didst become security for me with thy Son, and that I have paid the money; and thou art my witness [to the fact]."" And those who were there heard a voice from the image which said, ""The money of the Jew reached him when So-and-so and So-and-so were with him, on the day of my festival; and the money is in his treasury."" And when the Jew heard this every member of his body quaked. And he believed and was baptized, together with the men of his house; and that image is called to this day the ""Image of witness.""

Fol. 72a.] NOW there was a certain monk whose name was Timothy, and he was a steward of the church, and he loved our holy Lady, Mary the twofold Virgin, the God-bearer. And it fell out on a day that he drank some sweet wine, and he fell asleep and was unable to rise up at midnight for prayer. And when he awoke from his sleep in the morning he rose up to go to the church, and as he was on his way thither there came against him a lion, which roared at the monk and wished to tear him in pieces. Then straightway there came a lady who was shining with exceedingly great splendour, and she rebuked the lion and drove him away from the monk, who then went on his way to the church, marvelling at the lady who had delivered him from the lion. And when he had finished his prayer, he went to his work until the evening; and when the darkness fell he wished to go to the place where his bed was, and rest. Then straightway a mad dog rose up against him by the door of his house, and sprang upon him intending to bite him; and once again the shining lady came, and she drove away the dog. Then she led the monk into his sleeping room, and laid him upon his bed, and placed his pillow under his head; and she covered him over with his blanket, and made the sign of the Cross over him. Then the monk said unto her, ""O my Lady, I beseech thee to tell me who thou art."" And she said unto him, ""I am Mary, the Mother of Christ."" And when he heard her words he wished to bow down before her, and to embrace her feet, but she straightway disappeared from him. And he rose up in the morning and meditated in his heart concerning what he had seen, and he knew that the lion and the dog were of the deceitful phantoms of Satan, and he became certain that it was our holy Lady, the compassionate one, who extendeth help unto those who serve her, who had de livered him. Then he repented that he had been drunken with wine, and he never again turned to strong drink.

Fol. 56b, No. 47.] THERE was a certain honourable and blessed man who had a wife who was honourable and holy. And after they were married they made a covenant together that they would dwell together in a state of purity for the rest of the days of their lives. And after many days, when he was sleeping on a certain Friday morning, the lust of the flesh attacked him; but the woman did not wish to approach him, and she said unto him, ""Art thou not afraid of God? And wilt thou not keep the covenant that is between us? Moreover, this is the night of the eve of the Sabbath."" But the man did not turn away at her words. And when the woman knew that he would not let her alone, she said unto him, ""Whomsoever thou shalt beget this night shall belong to Satan""; and at that moment she conceived by him. And when the days of her conception were ended, she brought forth a man child of exceedingly great beauty and fine form. And when he grew up and had reached the age of twelve years, Satan appeared unto his mother, and said unto her, ""Remember thou this day, and mark well that three years hence thou shalt give unto me him whom thou didst vow unto me."" And whensoever the woman looked at her son she was stricken with sorrow, and she wept bitterly; and the youth marvelled and asked his mother [why], but she neither revealed the matter to him nor talked to him about it. And when her sorrow increased her son forced her to tell him the cause of it, and she told him all that had happened, and how Satan had appeared unto her, and what he had said unto her. And when her son heard his mother's words he was afraid, but he placed his trust upon the glorious God and hoped for His mercy, and he took asylum with our Lady Mary, the mediatress, and sought for help from her. And he departed to the city of Rome, and he took counsel with the Papa, who wrote a letter for him and sent him to the Bishop of Jerusalem; and he went to Jerusalem and told the Bishop all his affair. And the Bishop wrote a letter and sent it to a certain solitary monk (or, anchorite) unto whom the angels ministered and brought his food from heaven. And when the youth came to that anchorite, before he could declare his business the monk knew it. And he said unto him, ""Fear thou not, O my son. There is no hope for us except in taking asylum with our Lady Mary, the arbitrix and intercessor, and she will help us."" And the anchorite made the youth to stand between him and the altar, at the time of consecrating [the Mysteries], for he was afraid for him. When, however, the day of the appointed time came for Satan to take the youth away, he caught him as he stood by the altar at the moment when the monk was celebrating the Divine Mysteries, and took him down into Sheol and to the punishment that appertaineth thereto. And when the youth saw this he cried out in his great fright and called upon the name of our Lady Mary, the merciful one and intercessor, the hope of sinners and the glory of believers; and she delivered him quickly from Sheol, and restored him to the anchorite. And when the anchorite said, ""Peace be to all of you, ""the youth replied, ""with thy spirit""; and when the anchorite had finished the consecration the youth told him what he had seen. And the anchorite rejoiced and praised God, and gave thanks unto our Lady Mary. And thereupon the anchorite rose up and pronounced a blessing over his head, and committed him to the care of our Lady Mary, and he said unto him, ""My son, I commit thee to the care of her who delivereth those who commit themselves to her."" And he sent him to his parents, so that they might see him and rejoice. And the young man used to declare the excellence of our Lady Mary at all times. Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933.

172,The merchant who distributed as alms the money that had been loaned him by a friend.,Europe probably,"Rowan, Budge L THE VIRGIN MARY AND THE MERCHANT WHO BEGGARED HIMSELF FOR HER SAKE [Brit. Mus. MS. Orient. No. 652. Fol. 58b, No. 48.] THERE was a certain rich merchant who loved to give alms abundantly, and one day he pondered in his mind and said within himself, ""I have much goods and possessions, and if they give alms after my death on my behalf what will it benefit me? It will be far better for me to give them away during my lifetime so that God may receive me."" And he began to give away his goods to the poor, and the needy, and the orphans, and he did so until they came to an end, and he had nothing at all left. And as he was going about through the city he met a merchant who was a friend of his and who said unto him, ""What hath happened to thee? And what hast thou found? If thou hast come to poverty grieve not, for I myself will give thee ten thousand dinars wherewith thou canst traffick."" And the merchant said unto him, ""If thou wilt give me money thou shalt have interest on it""; and he gave him the money to traffick therewith, and to get back his money, and the profit thereon was to belong to the borrower, and the lender was to take what he had lent. And the borrower began to scatter the money among the poor according to his wont, and when the lender met him he enquired of him concerning it. And one day the owner of the money went to the borrower's house to see his goods which he had bought for him, and he found a crowd of beggars before his door. And he said unto them, ""What do ye here?"" And they said unto him, ""We are waiting for the merchant to come out."" And when the owner of the money heard these words, he smote his face and said, ""Thou hast wasted thy money on a madman""; and he went forth to seek the borrower in the city. And when he found him he seized him, and buffeted him, and reviled him, and said unto him, ""O perverse one, thou hast wasted my money! Take me back quickly and show me what thou hast bought."" And the borrower bore with the rich man patiently, and he said unto him, ""I have not wasted thy money. Come, that I may show thee what I have bought, and thou canst know thy profit, and every thing that I have bought will please thee."" And at that moment he thrust out the people that he might show the rich man his money, together with the profit thereon. And the rich merchant departed to his abode, and the blessed man (i.e. the borrower) went into his abode. And when the merchant was asleep he saw in a dream that the day of recompense had arrived, and that the Judgement was prepared. And the angels and the devils stood up afar off, and they brought men to be judged, and some of them did the devils carry. And behold, they brought the merchant to be judged, and the devils seized him and said, ""He is ours""; and the angels withdrew from him and the devils dragged him away to Sheol. And our blessed Lady Mary, the lover of mercy, came to that place shining with light, and the place was lighted up by her splendour, and she rebuked the devils and said unto them, ""He doth not belong to you, let him go, for he hath spent the greater part of his money in alms."" And the devils said unto her, ""He hath not given it away of his own free will."" And our Lady Mary said, ""Go ye and ask him whether he hath given away his money in alms of his own free will or not."" And whilst they were going to ask him, he awoke from his dream; and he rose up quickly and went to the good man and cried out with a loud voice, saying, ""I am satisfied with everything that thou hast done""; and he gave him other moneys, and he said, ""Spend them in alms on my behalf."" And he devoted himself to giving thanks unto our Lady Mary who had delivered him from the devils. Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933. One Hundred and Ten Miracles of Our Lady Mary, pp. 185-187.

Fol. 60a, No. 49.] THERE were two brothers in the city of Rome; the name of the one was Peter and that of the other Stephen. Now Peter was a deacon, and a governor in the church, and he did what was good, as was right, for the church, but he was a lover of money. And Stephen was a magistrate of the city, and he loved bribes, and in the excess of his extortion and wrong doing he robbed the church of Saint Sirloreyos, and filched from it certain houses; and he also robbed the church of our Lady Mary, and took from it a garden (or, plantation). And when Peter the deacon died they judged him for his actions and set him in the Jahannam of fire. And after a few days Stephen the extortioner died, and Sirloreyos went to him being wroth with him, and he seized his arm, and by reason of his exceedingly great strength the mark remained in his hand (or, arm). And they condemned him with the sentence of death. Now during his lifetime Stephen used to celebrate the festival of Saint Peter, and each year he used to give alms in abundance on the day of his festival, and make gifts to the churches. And as he was going to perdition Saint Peter appeared unto him, and he heard a mighty voice which said, ""O Peter, help thy friend who used to pay honour to thee and rejoice in thee, for, behold, they are carrying him to perdition."" And straightway Peter delivered him from the hands of the devil, and brought him to Sirloreyos, and forgave him his sin. And he entreated our Lady Mary, and she forgave him, and she took him before our Lord Jesus Christ, and she bowed low before Him and asked Him to take Stephen back to his body, and He agreed to do so. And then our Lady Mary, the compassionate one, said, ""Thou shalt only abide for thirty days—until thou payest back everything which thou hast taken by extortion, and thou shalt recite every day the psalm, 'Blessed are those who are pure in their way, who walk in the Law of God.' "" And as he was coming back he heard a great noise, and in that noise he heard the voice of his brother Peter. And he said unto him, ""O my brother, hast thou also been in the judgement?"" and his brother said unto him, ""I have been in Jahannam."" And he said unto him, ""Canst thou be saved?"" And he said unto him, ""Yea, if the father hath prayed together with all the priests who are in the church on my behalf."" And when Stephen returned into the world he told the father everything that had happened to him, and he showed him the mark in his hand where [Saint] Sirloreyos (sic) had gripped him, and he also told him that he was to live thirty days—until he had given back what he had taken [by oppression]. And the father prayed for him, and made offerings on behalf of Peter; and Stephen restored everything that he had taken, and re cited the psalm which our Lady Mary had commanded him to repeat daily. And after thirty days he died and entered into everlasting rest. May the blessing and sup plication of our Lady Mary be with us for ever and ever. Amen. Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933.

Now his sins were very many, and he loved eating, and drinking, and fornication. And he hated the poor and the needy, but he loved Michael the Archangel, and he celebrated his festival and rejoiced in him, and he served our Lady Mary, the compassion ate one, and he made salutations to her at all times. And one day, when he was sitting at his table, he meditated in his heart and said, ""Woe is me! I am a miser able wretch. How long shall I continue in [my] sin? Woe is me! With what face shall I stand before my Lord, and what shall be my answer [to Him], for I have never done any good thing? And now, I will make a monastery in my country, and I will establish saints therein, and when the building is finished I will become a monk and will dwell in it. And I will build the monastery in the name of Mary, and I will endow the monks."" And when he rose up from the table he com manded his servant to saddle his horse; and he mounted it and taking with him another man he rode out of the city and went about through his estate to look for a site whereon to build. And he found a site, a rocky eminence which streams of water surrounded on all sides, and he rejoiced that he had found a suitable place whereon to build the monastery in his own grounds. And he pondered as to the way in which he should build that monastery, and whilst he was thinking out the matter he died, and the devils seized his soul and wanted to cast it into Sheol. And Michael the Archangel met them, and said unto them, ""This soul doth not belong to you; set it free."" And the devils said unto him, ""If God judgeth rightly it will belong unto us."" And when Michael heard their words he held his peace [for a sea son], and then he said unto them, ""I will dispute with you for the possession of this soul before God.""

And whilst he was thinking out this matter he died; do not Thou blot out his re ward."" And our Lord commanded Michael to go and redeem his soul from out of the hand of the devils.

And he said unto him, ""There is no other thing for thee except to set thy hope upon Mary, the compassionate Lady, and to seek help from her, for she is a mediatress, and doth not reject the petitions of the poor and needy."" And when that bishop heard this word, he knew that it was true, and he rose up straight way, and departed to the church of our Lady Mary. And he prostrated himself before the altar, and he wept very bitter tears, and he smote upon his breast as he made supplication unto her. And our Lady Mary ap peared unto him, and she rebuked him and said unto him, ""Who hath brought thee into this my house to defile it with thy mouth which is full of cursing and guile? Rise up and get thee forth [from it]."" And she disappeared from him. And when he heard these words his sorrow was increased, and his pain multiplied, and his weeping was more abundant. And he stood there imploring her aid, and he persisted in petitioning her, and he made his face to burn [as he rubbed it] on the ground. And our Lady the Virgin Mary appeared unto him a second time, and she said unto him, ""Did I not say unto thee, Get thee forth from my house and come not back?"" And she disappeared from him. And the bishop said unto her with humbleness and sorrow of heart, ""O my Lady Mary, mother of light, and mother of mercy, who hast compassion on the race of the children of men, the object of boasting of the Christians, the haven of ships, how canst thou be called the mother of mercy after this day? for I cast myself upon thee, and I threw my soul down before thee. I beseech and entreat thee not to set me far away from thy mercy and thy compassion."" And straightway the heart of our Lady Mary was moved with compassion for him, and she stood up before the great throne of our Lord Jesus Christ, and she bowed down before Him and implored Him to forgive the bishop his sin, and to have com passion upon him. And she said unto Him, ""O Sea of mercy, and Fountain of life, treat not with contempt this my petition on behalf of this wretched man who hath confessed his sin, and who hath asked for mercy in making entreaty unto me."" And straightway He said unto her, ""What thou hast asked of Me is conceded, and thy prayer is accepted by Me, and I have forgiven his sin for thy sake."" And straightway she took Mar Peter and she appeared unto the bishop and said unto him, ""Our Lord Jesus Christ hath forgiven thee thy sin; do not commit the like again. And speak these words also to Peter."" And the bishop rejoiced with a great joy and he went forth and gathered together the people and told them what our Lady Mary, the com passionate one, had done for him, and they praised God the Most High and gave thanks to our Lady Mary. And then the Papa asked him to whom he had sold the holy oil, but he would not return it to him, and he bought with the price of the holy oil two pearls. And Mar Peter appeared and said unto him, ""Lay them upon the statue of our Lady Mary, for she was the cause of thy escape with thy Master and thy Lord.""

176,The avaricious priest who visited a dying man who loved bribes.,Africa Ethiopia probably,"XCVII THE VIRGIN MARY AND THE AVARICIOUS PRIEST [Brit. Mus. MS. Orient. No. 652. Fol. 67a.] THERE was a certain priest who loved money, and also a man who loved gifts (i.e. bribes); now the latter fell sick of a serious disease. And the priest heard of the sickness of the man of bribes, and he went to him to visit him, and he spake unto him words of cheerfulness, saying, ""God forbid, my lord. No evil shall befall you. God shall have compassion upon you, be not afraid. Nevertheless reckon up thy possessions, for thou wilt not die because thou hast reckoned them up."" And as the priest was talking to him—now there was a deacon [with him]—a handmaiden came and said unto the priest, ""Rise up, and administer the Eucharist to an old woman who is in tribulation."" Now the old woman was a good and holy woman, and she served in the church, and feared God, and she was poor and she loved our Lady Mary, the compassionate. And when the priest heard the words of the handmaiden he said unto her angrily, ""How can I possibly leave a man of such high position as this to go to an old woman? Fear not, moreover, O my daughter, for there are many days for the aged"" (i.e. they live a long time). And the deacon said unto the priest, ""Rise up, [and go] for the old woman feareth God and loveth our Lady Mary, and if she dieth without the Eucharist it will be imputed to thee for sin."" And the priest said unto him, ""Fear thou not, the old woman will not die, for the days of the aged are many."" And that old woman used to pray to, and worship, and minister to our Lady Mary, and everything which she obtained possession of, whether it was wax or whether it was oil, she used to give to the church, and in every way she took refuge in our Lady Mary. And the handmaiden came back again to the priest, and she said unto him, ""Rise up, come that thou mayest administer the Eucharist to the old woman, for she is in great agony."" And the deacon said unto the priest, ""If thou refusest to go I myself will go and ad minister the Eucharist ""; and the priest said unto him, ""Go, and leave me with this man of wealth and position, for my heart hath loved him for many days."" And the deacon departed and took the Body of our Lord from the church, and then went on to the old woman. And the old woman was sitting in a dark chamber, and when the deacon drew nigh to the place, he saw a great light proceeding from the room. And he looked in and saw many women sitting with the old woman, and they were arrayed in light and were twelve in number. And our Lady Mary was sitting by the head of the old woman, and her face was shining with the brightness of the lightning, and she had in her hand a napkin wherewith she wiped away the sweat from [the face of] the old woman. Now the old woman was in the agony of death, and she was sweating through the intensity of the pain. And the deacon was terrified at the sight which he saw, and our Lady Mary made a sign to him with her hand, and she said unto him, ""Keep back and listen to what I am going to say unto thee, and administer the Holy Mystery unto her."" And she said unto the women, ""Arise, let us go away until her soul and body are saved""; and the deacon administered to the old woman the Holy Mystery. And the deacon de parted to the priest, rejoicing at what he had seen and heard, but concerning this he told the priest nothing. And the man who loved bribes decreed in his will that he gave all his property to his wife, and he gave her power to dispose of what she pleased and to retain what she pleased. And the deacon saw several black creatures like cats with claws and tails, and they were thrusting themselves into the mouth and nostrils of the man, and he was shrieking and crying out, saying, ""Drive away these cats, for my soul is suffering the tortures of hell."" And the deacon suddenly saw a great and terrifying Satan of a frightful form come down and stand upon that man's head, and he had in his hand a red-hot spear which he thrust into the body of the man, and his soul went forth. Thus the priest obtained nothing for his labour except weariness and exhaustion. And the deacon went again to that old woman to visit her, and he saw a large company of angels, and our Lady Mary standing among them; and behold, the old woman died, and they took her pure soul and carried it up into heaven. May her blessing be with us all for ever and ever. Amen. Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933. One Hundred and Ten Miracles of Our Lady Mary, pp. 321-323. London: Oxford University Press, H.

Fol. 69a, No. 55.] THERE was a religious house in a certain city, and in it was a young widow of goodly person, and she loved our Lady Mary, the compassionate one, and rejoiced in celebrating her festivals. And Satan was envious of her, and he plotted against her by means of a certain rich young knight who loved her and sent gifts unto her; and Satan made love for him to take root in her heart. And he said unto her, ""Let me send some of my servants at midnight to bring thee unto me""; and she said unto him, ""I agree."" And on the night about which they had made the compact together, the widow sat in the church waiting for the envoys of the knight. And slumber seized her, and it seemed to her in her dream that the devils carried her off and brought her into Sheol to a place where there was great wailing, and she saw them casting many people into it. And she cried out to our Lady Mary and begged for her help, but our Lady Mary stood up above Sheol, being filled with wrath against her. And when the widow continued to cry out ever more and more our Lady Mary said unto her, ""Thou criest out, but thou dost not wish for my help; thou wishest to go to the knight and to leave me, and the knight wisheth to leave thee in this place."" And at that moment the devils cast her into Sheol, and our Lady Mary said, ""I do not wish to have her destroyed, and I will save her."" And the widow, being terrified and shaking with fright, cried out loudly. And when she saw the servants of the knight standing up there and waiting for her, she cried out against them and reviled them, and said unto them, ""Your lord wisheth to drag me down into Sheol, and if ye do not be gone I will tell the mother of the nunnery, and others."" And the servants of the knight turned away and they told their lord what had happened. And when he knew about her dream, he repented of what he had done, and he wept with a great weeping because of his manifold sins. And he said, ""Woe is me! I have become a thing meet for Sheol, and a stone of stumbling in the path of the believers."" And he rose up straight way, and sold all his goods and possessions, and distributed the money in alms.

Fol. 70a.] AND it came to pass in the city of Rome in the days of 'Afara, the king, that certain men made a journey to the city in order that they might worship therein. And as they were going along they stopped at a church which was dedicated in the name of Paul, and by the side of it was another which was dedicated in the name of our Lady Mary, and the people brought food for them to eat. And they found a man there who was seated, and who made sport of them and jested at them, saying, ""My lord is better than your lord, and my dear one is better than your dear one."" And the brethren marvelled at him, and they made enquiries about him, and the people said to them, ""This is a cattle herd. And behold, being weary of watching his cattle, and exhausted by the great labour of keeping them together, he gave himself to Satan that he might take him away from it and give him rest from his toil."" And when the brethren heard this they were exceedingly sorry, and they rose up straightway and went into the church of Mark (sic), and began to entreat our Lady Mary on behalf of that man. And they said in their prayer, ""O All-powerful-One, who didst direct Paul when he was an enemy of the faithful, and didst make him a preacher in Thy Name, and an obedient servant of Thine, we beseech Thee and we beseech Mary Thy mother, to have compassion upon this poor and wretched man, and to save him from this Satan by Thy mercy."" And whilst they were praying one of the brethren went out and looked at that man who was weeping, and he said unto the brother, ""Why do ye pray for me? Cannot ye see my friend standing by the door, and waiting for me to die?"" And the brother returned to the church, and told his brethren that their prayer would be heard by God, and he commanded them not to cease praying. And the brother went into the church of our Lady Mary, and the man who had sold himself to the Devil went in with him. And the brother commanded him to confess his sins, and he arrayed him in the garb of the brethren, and they took him with them into the city of Rome, and they made him a monk with them. And God had mercy upon him, and he remained in this world suffering punishment, and at the last day he suffered no punishment. And at times Satan used to lay hold of him and beat him; and sometimes he would drag him about by the hair of his head, and by his feet and his hands. And whensoever he saw Satan coming to him, he used to cry out from the depths of his heart; and whenever the brethren heard his cry they would come to him, and lay hold upon him and help him with their prayer. And he continued to suffer from this disease for the space of two years, and then our Lady Mart had compassion upon him, and drove Satan away from him, and saved him. Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933.

180,The rich knight who was advised by an abbot to pray to Saint Mary to win the heart of the woman with whom he was in love.,Europe probably,"LVI THE VIRGIN MARY AND THE KNIGHT WHO BECAME A MONK [Brit. Mus. Orient. No. 652. Fol. 72b, No. 58.] THERE was a certain knight who exulted in his splendid youth and strength, and boasted himself in the abundance of his riches, and he loved a woman who lived in a certain city, and he gave her much money in order to obtain her, but although he gave her many gifts he was unable to get possession of her body. And he loved her far more than anything else, and by reason of his excessive love for her he ceased not [to think] of her by day and by night, and at length he became mad. And when he did not know what else to do he went to a certain monastery wherein lived a holy man who feared God and loved our Lady Mary, the compassionate one, and he confessed his sins and bowed down before him by reason of the greatness of his love for that woman. And when the Father heard his words and saw the sorrow of his heart he said unto him, ""O my brother, if thou wilt accept what I am going to say to thee, thou shalt obtain thy desire from this woman whom thou lovest."" And the knight said unto him, ""There is no command of thine which I would transgress concerning the love of that woman if only thou wilt enable me to obtain her."" And the Father said unto him, ""If thou wilt hearken unto what I shall say unto thee thou shalt obtain thy wish."" And the knight said unto him, ""There is nothing in the world that shall be too hard for me to do for the love of that woman."" And the Father said unto him, ""If thou wilt say, 'Salutation, O our Lady Mary,' two and fifty times each day thou shalt obtain thy desire."" And the knight said unto him, ""This is an easy thing for me to do""; and the Father said, ""This is not an easy thing, but if thou wilt say it for the period of one year thou wilt find everything that thou seekest."" So the knight took this labour upon him, and he rose up from before the Father rejoicing in this labour, and he forsook every other work, and concentrated his mind on the prayer. And when the knight had come nigh to complete the year, he determined to go a hunting, and he invited his friends to go with him, and he took his slaves, and they departed into the desert and spread themselves out to hunt. And when it was the time of noon, he remained alone, and he could not find any one of his men, and having become separated entirely from them whilst he was searching for them, he saw a little ruined church in the desert, and he remembered that he had not recited his ""Salutation"" to our Lady Mary that day. And he went to the church, and he alighted from his horse and went into the church, and he saw therein an old picture whereon was painted a figure of our Lady Mary. And he stood up before her, and he prayed with reverence, and he meditated upon our Lady Mary, and the beauty of her apparel, and her mouth, and her teeth, and the sweetness of her voice. And he was sad and said, ""O my Lady Mary, when shall thy mercy come to me, and when shall I obtain my desire? Behold, the year hath come to an end."" And as he was wishing to leave the church our Lady Mary appeared unto him, and she was wearing the apparel of light, and on her head was a crown wrought with gold and studded with gems of price, and her face was shining, and the radiance and brilliance of the lightning flashed from her garments. And when the knight saw her he was stunned with the beauty of her person and her majesty, and he prostrated himself before her. And she raised him up and said unto him, ""I am she whom thou didst petition to bring thee to thy desire and to thy darling. Tell me now: wouldst thou have me for thy darling or her?"" And he said unto her, ""O my Lady, how couldst thou possibly be darling to me?"" And she said unto him, ""If thou wilt serve me another year I will take thee with me to the kingdom of heaven, which shall never come to an end. But thou must never cease from my service, and thou must never worship anyone else except myself."" And then she disappeared from him. And the knight went forth from the church rejoicing, and happy at what he had seen. And he went to the Father and told him everything that our Lady Mary had said unto him, and he became a monk with him, and there was left in his heart nothing except the remembrance of our Lady Mary and of the sweetness of her voice and the beauty of her person. And he served her also another year, and died in peace, and our Lady Mary took him even as she had promised him, and he was saved from the Enemy, and from his tribulations by the prayer of the pure Virgin.

181,The monk custodian of the church who prayed to see Saint Mary.,Europe probably,"[2 versions] LVII THE VIRGIN MARY AND THE MONK WHO BLEW A HORN AT THE TIMES OF PRAYER [Brit. Mus. MS. Orient. No. 652. Fol. 74a, No. 59.] THERE was a monk in a certain monastery who was keeper of the treasury of the church, and he played upon the horn at all times and seasons; now he was a priest, and he feared God and loved our Lady Mary with all his heart, and he ministered unto her by day and by night, and he entreated her to appear to him either in a dream or when he was awake. And he prayed this prayer continually and said, ""O my Lady Mary, since thy picture (or, image) upon earth is adorned with such great honour and is beloved by all, what must thy glory be in heaven?"" And by reason of the greatness of his love for her he said unto her, ""O my Lady Mary, if thou canst not appear unto me in visible form because I am unworthy [of this honour], I beseech thee to appear unto me in a dream by night so that I may be satisfied with a sight of thy beautiful form."" And in the intensity of his crying the tears poured down his face, and he went to his bed, for he was exhausted by keeping long vigil. And as he slept he saw in his dream that the whole church was filled with such bright light that he thought it was on fire. And he rose up quickly and went into the church, and he saw our Lady Mary standing there arrayed in apparel of gold wherein precious stones had been worked, and upon her head was a crown which no person living on the earth could look upon, and rays like the lightning flash shot forth from her eyes. And the monk knew that she was our Lady Mary. And he saw in her hand a roll written in gold in writing like which no man could write in all the world, and he prostrated himself before her. And she said unto him, ""What dost thou wish for?"" And he said unto her, ""O my Lady, I beseech thee to show me what is written in the roll."" And she said unto him, ""Look thou at what is in it—the Prophecy of Isaiah""; and again he prostrated himself at her feet. And she said unto him, ""What dost thou wish for?"" And he said unto her, ""O my Lady, I beseech thee to allow me to approach to thy feet that I may kiss them."" And she said unto him, ""Far be it from thee that thou shouldst kiss my feet with thy holy mouth wherewith thou hast consecrated the Offering and said the prayers of consecration, and pronounced the benediction of Peace for many days. But kiss thou my cheek with thy pure mouth."" And he kissed her cheek, and through the fervour of his kissing and the sweetness of her joy he awoke from his dream. And straightway the dawn broke and the brethren assembled in the church and prayed, but he continued to think upon the beauty of our Lady Mary, and the sweetness of her voice, and her splendid apparel; and he neither opened his mouth nor uttered a single word of prayer. And when they had finished their prayer they came to him in a body and re buked him because he had not prayed with them. And the chief [monk] beat him, but he did not feel what they were doing, because of the sweetness of our Lady Mary, the love of whom had taken possession of his heart. And he walked the straight road, and served our Lady Mary, the compassionate one, until he died and entered into the kingdom of heaven. Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933.

Aeth. 69, No. 49, Fol. 53a.] A MIRACLE of our Lady Mary: may her prayer and supplication preserve Tanshe' Krestos! Amen. Among the monks of the Monastery of Sarabyon (Serapion) there was a certain monk whose name was Natan (Nathan), and he held the office of steward and watched over the treasures (i.e. revenues) of the church. And he used to blow a trumpet (or, horn?) when the times for prayer arrived, for he was a priest and an elder, and he was an excellent man and a fearer of God, and he loved our Lady Mary with all his heart, and he used to minister unto her in the church by day and by night. And with many groans he used to entreat Mary to address to him comfortable words at night, either when he was asleep or when he was awake, and he prayed to her continually to appear unto him. And he said, ""O my Lady, Mother of mercy and compassion, behold, since thy picture which is upon the earth is decorated gloriously, and is preferred to 'thousands of gold [and silver],' and is beloved by everyone, how splendid must thy glory be which is in heaven!"" And because of the greatness of his love for her he said unto her, ""I beseech thee, O my Lady Virgin, if thou art not able to show thyself unto me in thine actual form because it is not meet for me, I entreat thee to reveal unto me in a dream of the night a vision of thy face and the beauty of thy bodily form which I should hold to be sweeter than wine and delicate food made with honey. And each morning I will multiply for thee the signs of my love for thee."" And having recited these words, and made an end [of his prayers], he rose up and went to his couch. And the tears poured down his face, for he was wearied with standings up and with vigils, and then he lay down and slept. And on that very day at midnight he saw a great light which filled the church, and thinking that the building was on fire he rose up straightway, and went hurriedly into the church. And he saw our Lady Mary standing therein, and she was arranged in splendid apparel wherein gold and colours were woven, and she was adorned with a pearl which shone brightly. And upon her head was a crown which all those who are on the earth could not gaze upon, and its splendour shot out rays of light, and fascinated the eyes. And when he saw this he knew and understood that it was our Lady Mary. And again he saw in her hand a book which was written in gold, and there was not a man in the world who was able to read one word of it. And he bowed low with the knees of his heart upon the ground before the eyes of our Lady Mary. And Mary said unto him, ""Tell me, O man, what it is thou seekest and what it is thou desirest."" And he answered and said unto her, ""O my Lady, I beseech thee to show me the book which is in thy hand."" And our Lady Mary said unto him, ""Take and look at what is therein—the prophecy of Isaiah, the prophet."" And again he bowed low at her feet. And Mary said unto him, ""And now what dost thou desire?"" And he an swered and said unto her, ""O my Lady, I beseech thee to give me leave to kiss thy feet,"" And she said unto him, ""God forbid that thou shouldst kiss my feet with thy holy mouth wherewith thou dost present the Offer ing. And thou hast sanctified thy hands and hast ad ministered the Holy Mystery therewith to the people, and thou hast never omitted the Salutation to me which is arranged to be said daily. But come and kiss my cheek with thy pure mouth."" And he drew nigh unto her and kissed her cheek, and the sweet perfume of her was diffused in his nose and mouth. And he became drunk in his spirit (or, soul) like a man who hath drunk newly fermented wine, and he went forth rejoicing and happy and filled with laughter. And he awoke from his sleep and found that the day had already dawned, and he blew the trumpet according to his wont, and the people assembled in the church and they all prayed together. Now he separated himself from their company, and did not pray with them, and he was meditating in his heart upon the beauty and the goodliness of her person, and the sweetness of her voice, and [the splendour of] her apparel, and the magnificence of her majesty. And because of this he never opened his mouth at all, and did not utter a word. And when the monks had finished their morning prayers they gathered together about him, and reviled him, and the archimandrite was wroth with him and smote him with [his] staff, and he did not know what they said unto him and why they reviled him, and why they smote him with a stick, because of the drunkenness of the spirit which was caused by absorbing the sweet perfume of Mary as if he had drunk wine. And the love for her sprouted and blossomed in his heart, and he walked in the right way, and he served and ministered unto her all the day of his life until he died in peace and entered into the kingdom of the heavens. May the supplication and entreaty of our Lady Mary the Virgin, and her prayer and blessing be with us. Amen. Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933. One Hundred and Ten Miracles of Our Lady Mary, pp. 210-212.

Fol. 75b, No. 60.] THERE was a certain very rich merchant who trafficked by land and by sea, but the condition of affairs changed in respect of him, and all his money came to an end, and his establishment went to ruin, and his assistants were dispersed, and his servants ceased to be because he had fallen into poverty. And when he saw that he had fallen from his state of glory, and that his joy was turned into sorrow, his mind was grievously oppressed, and he was unable to bear himself. And he said, ""Henceforth I cannot dwell in this city, but I will go into another country where I shall be able to live on much or on little, and if I steal there will be none to bring a charge against me, and if I beg there will be none who will know me."" And he went forth from the city in sadness, and he took to flight with the tears pouring down his face. And Satan met him on the way and said unto him, ""O my brother, why art thou sorrowful? Why weepest thou?"" And the merchant said unto him, ""Who art thou that I should tell thee what hath befallen me?"" And the Devil said unto him, ""I am Satan."" And the merchant said unto him, ""If thou art Satan, art thou able to help me?"" And then the merchant told him everything that had befallen him, and how he was going into another city to live where he could steal or beg. And Satan said unto him, ""If thou wilt accept my words thou canst become all the days of thy life far richer than before."" And he said unto him, ""Open thy wallet, and take out what is therein""; and the merchant opened his wallet, and he gave him two pearls that were gems of great price. And because of the greatness of his joy the merchant said unto Satan, ""What dost thou wish me to do for thee?"" And Satan said unto him, ""Deny Christ, and the Cherubim, and the Seraphim, and Baptism, and Christianity, and Mary."" And when the merchant heard the conclusion of his words he said, ""I will deny all these, with the exception of Mary, and her I will never deny."" And Satan said unto him, ""If thou wilt not deny Mary all else that thou mayest do will not profit thee""; and thus saying Satan left him and disappeared from his sight. And the merchant opened his wallet so that he might look at the pearls, and they were transformed and had become sand. And he was exceedingly sad, and he said, ""Woe is me! Most assuredly it hath not profited me that I have made an end of my money, and forsaken my city and my people, and have also made an end of my belief and sinned against Christ my Creator."" And he went along the road weeping, and as he pondered he was very sad. Now as he was journeying on he came upon a ruined (or, lonely) church by the side of the road, and he went in that he might rest, and he saw there a picture (or, image) of our Lady Mary. And he wept bitterly before her, and shed floods of tears, and with a sorrowful heart he said, ""O my Lady Mary, I put my trust in thy compassion: Thou knowest that I did not deny thee, and I beseech thee to commend me to the love of thy Son Who went forth from thy belly""; and through his exceedingly great sorrow he fell asleep. And our Lady Mary, the compassionate one, appeared unto him with her Son Who was sitting upon His throne, and she stood before Him and said unto Him, ""O my Son, I beseech Thee to forgive the sin of this miserable man and sinner."" And the Lord Jesus said unto her, ""I will not forgive him because he denied Me and My angels."" And when she heard this she wept bitterly, saying, ""I beseech Thee, O my Son, to forgive this sinner his sin. I adjure Thee by my breasts which Thou hast sucked."" And our Lord Jesus Christ said unto her, ""I will not forgive this wicked man, for he denied Me and My angels, and rejected his baptism and his Christianity."" And when she heard this, she stripped off her apparel, and said unto Him as she drew out her breasts, ""If Thou wilt not forgive him for my sake, I will slit open my breasts and rip up my body."" And when our Lord saw what she would do He rose up from His throne and sat in her bosom, and embraced her and kissed her, and dried His mother's tears with His holy hair (?). And He said unto her, ""Be not sad, O My Mother, I forgive him his sin for thy sake."" And our Lady Mary went to the man and said unto him, ""Henceforth thou shalt sin no more. Rise up and pray to God for the salvation of thy soul""; and then she disappeared from him. And the merchant awoke from his dream, and went to a monastery and became a monk. And he gave thanks unto God and praise unto our Lady Mary all the days of his life until he died and entered into the kingdom of heaven. Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933.

183,A herdsman saves his beasts in a storm by praying to Saint Mary.,Europe probably,"XCIV THE VIRGIN MARY AND THE SHEPHERD WHOSE FLOCK SHE SAVED [Brit. Mus. MS. Orient. No. 652. Fol. 78a.] THERE was a certain herdsman who pastured sheep and cattle, and he was a simple man, and he loved our Lady Mary with all his heart, and he served her, and he stood up before her in every place, and he never ceased to say the salutation of the Angel Gabriel to her. And that salutation was in his mouth by day and by night, in going and coming, in sitting down and rising up. Now on the night of the festival of our Lady Mart a heavy mist rose up and there was snow. And the man expected that his beasts would die of the great cold, and he was sad, and he went outside his house and looked at the sky, and he began to pray to God, and turning his eyes to our Lady Mary he said, ""O Lady Mary, be not far from my beasts, and have mercy upon thy servants who serve thee by day and by night, and diminish not the fodder of these beasts which through the compassion of thy Son feed on thy gracious gifts."" And when he had finished his prayer he fell upon the ground, and there was a break in the storm and a period of rest. And when the man saw [this] he gave thanks unto our Lady Mary, the mother of mercy. And she appeared unto him and said unto him, ""How long hast thou toiled? I wish to take thee so that thou mayest have rest."" And he said unto her, ""Until when, O my Lady?"" And she said unto him, ""Until the seventh day. And go to the monastery and tell the Archimandrite that he must make thee to rest from thy toil seven days by the word of the miracle which I spake to him under the tree."" And then she disappeared from him. And the shepherd went to the monastery, and when the monks saw him they said unto him, ""Why hast thou come? Hast thou left thy beasts?"" And he said unto them, ""I wish to speak to the Archimandrite."" And they said unto him, ""What canst thou want with the Archimandrite? If thou wishest to obtain consolation (i.e. to confess) speak to one of the brethren""; and the man said, ""I will speak to the Archimandrite only."" And the monks went to the Archimandrite and told him about the coming of the shepherd, and how he would speak to no one but him. And they said to him, ""Behold, he hath come and left his beasts. And we said unto him, If thou wishest to obtain consolation speak to one of the brethren; but he said, I will only speak to the Archimandrite."" And the Archimandrite rose up from his chamber, and went to the shepherd. And the shepherd bowed down at the feet of the Archimandrite and told him all that our Lady Mary had said unto him, and of the miracle (or, sign) under the tree. And when the Archimandrite heard of this miracle he understood, and straightway fell down at the feet of the shepherd. And he took him to his own abode, and he arrayed him in purple, and he paid him honour and ministered unto him, and he asked him to intercede with God on his behalf. And when seven days were ended he ordered the monks to leave their work and to gather together in the chamber of the brethren, and he commanded the shepherd to pray on behalf of them all. And the brethren marvelled at that act, and they said to one another, ""This man hath no [ascetic] toil [to his credit], what doth he wish to do?"" And whilst the brethren were talking together, the shepherd died forthwith. And the Archimandrite began to tell the brethren the matter of the man, and why our Lady Mary had sent him to him, and then he urged them to increase their service to her, and to pay special honour to her, for she rewardeth all those who minister unto her with good things both in heaven and upon earth. And when the monks heard these words they were exceedingly sorry that they had reviled the shepherd, and they entreated God to forgive them their sins. And they gave thanks unto our Lady Mary, the compassionate. Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933. One Hundred and Ten Miracles of Our Lady Mary, pp. 314-316. London: Oxford University Press, H.

Fol. 79b.] THERE was a young man who lived in a certain town, and he was good, and excellent, and God fearing, and loved what was good and rejected what was bad from his youth up; now he was poor and he lived on what the labour of his hands produced. He went into the desert every day and split trees for firewood, or collected bundles of brushwood, which he sold in the market in order to live. And he loved our Lady Mary with all his heart, and he stood up before her and bowed to her, and he saluted her thrice daily, and ceased not to do so whether it rained or whether it snowed. One day he went out from the city and gathered together much brushwood, and he tied it in a bundle and lifted it up upon his head. And as he was coming into the city he came to the gate and saw a picture of our Lady Mary, and straightway he cast his load from his head into the gateway and he stood up and bowed to our Lady Mary. And many people were coming through the gate, and were unable to pass each other, and the gate-keeper rose up and said, ""What is the cause of this blocking of the way?"" And they told him, ""This young man hath cast his load down in the roadway."" And the gate-keeper turned and saw the young man standing opposite the picture (or, image) of our Lady Mary. And when the young man bowed to it the head of the figure shrouded itself in a covering, whilst the keeper of the gate looked on at the miracle. And he rose up and abased the young man and said unto him, ""Whence comest thou, and what dost thou do?"" And the young man said unto him, ""I am a poor man and I live by the labour of my hands."" And the keeper of the gate said unto him, ""I have seen Mart paring honour unto thee, and I also will pay thee hon our through love of her."" And the young man went to take up the brushwood, but the keeper of the gate stopped him and [then] he took him to his house, and he washed him, and cleansed hm from his dirt, and he dressed him in apparel, and gave him his daughter to wife, and gave him all his possessions.

And after he had said these words unto her he began to read the [Forty-two] Salutations to our Lady Mary, standing before her picture (or, image).

And when the artificer heard these words from the picture of our Lady Mary, he bowed down before her, and repented himself that he had dared to speak unto her; but he rejoiced because of the words which she had spoken unto him.

Fol. 84b, No. 67.] THERE was a certain Jew who possessed a herd of cows, and he had a son who used to pasture the cows outside the city with Christian children. And one day the cowherds gathered together to eat bread, and the son of the Jew came to eat with them. And they said unto him, ""Thou art a Jew and we are Christians; thou canst not eat with us until thou becomest a Chris tian like ourselves."" And he said unto them, ""Bring ye me to Christianity""; and they said unto him, ""Sit down."" And the cowherds took water from the vessel from which they drank, and sprinkled it on the head of the Jewish youth, and they said unto him, ""We baptize thee in the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and thy name shall be Garanin."" And straightway he sat down and ate with them, and when they called him by name they said ""Garanin."" And when the evening came the young Jew returned to the house of his father, and one saw a great light on him, and smelled an aroma that was more pleasant than that of any other scent, and it was sweeter than the smell of wine and unguent; and he sat down, and the people became drunk through the smell of his perfume. And the Jew said unto his son in the presence of his wife, ""Tell me, whence hast thou this sweet smell? Tell me quickly, so that I may not kill thee."" And the young man said unto him, ""O my father, I know not; no one hath perfumed me."" And his father said unto him, ""Tell me what thou hast done this day in the desert."" And the young man told him everything that the sons of the Christians had done to him, and how they stopped him from eating with them until they had baptized him, and how they had called him ""Garanin."" And when his father heard these words he was wroth with a great wrath, and they said, ""What shall we do with this wicked young man?"" And when the Jews saw this light and smelled the sweet perfume that emanated from him they became Christians. But the wife of the Jew said unto her husband, ""Get thee to such and such a man, the heater of the bath, and order him to light a great fire, and throw the young man into it so that he may be consumed."" And his father took him and carried him to the man who heated the bath, and he said unto him, ""Light a fire in the furnace of the bath""; and he did so, and he cast the young man into the furnace of fire, and shut the door of the furnace upon him. And in the morning of the following day a certain man of noble rank went to the bath-house to bathe, and he found the water cold. And he called the bath-keeper and told him to heat the bath for him, and when the bath-keeper went to the furnace he found it closed and with no fire inside it; and when he opened the door he found the young man sitting down, and the fire extinguished. And the bath-keeper said unto him, ""Who brought thee hither?"" And the young man said unto him with tears, ""My father cast me in here that the fire might consume me. And there came unto me a woman who was the most beautiful of women, and she took me to her bosom, and she extinguished the fire, and departed. And I did not wish either that thou shouldst or shouldst not come."" And when the bath-keeper heard this he cried out with a loud voice, and a crowd of men gathered together, and they brought out the young man from the furnace, and they took him to the bishop. And when the father and the mother of the young man heard that their son was alive they went to the bishop, and when they saw their son they cried out, saying, ""We brought him up in the Jewish Faith, and he hath become a believer in the Christian Faith."" And the young man told them everything that had befallen him from first to last, and all those who were there marvelled. And the bishop commanded that the youth should be fed [at his expense] all the days of his life, and he baptized the Jew and his wife; and many Jews were baptized on that day through the miracle that our Lady Mary, the mother of the Light, had wrought.

No. 652. Fol. 86b, No. 68.] THERE was a certain man of huge stature who was an artisan, and his name was Golyad, and he was in charge of many men. He was as strong as a lion, and he went about the world ravening and took no thought about his end. And one day as he was going to his work he came to a monastery of the saints of our Lady Mary, and the archimandrite did not pay him honour because of his wickedness. And when Golyad saw that the monks and their archimandrite treated him with contempt he was wroth, and said, ""When I return I will lay waste their monastery so thoroughly that every one shall say there has never been a monastery with monks in it in this place."" And after he had departed the monks heard what he had said concerning them, and they were sorrowful and greatly afraid, and said, ""He is a wicked man, and he will do everything that he said he would do."" And the monks and their archimandrite went to petition our Lady Mary, and they and their archimandrite prayed and lifted up their eyes to her. And whilst their holy archimandrite was praying, he fell asleep for a little space, and he saw as it were in his dream our holy Lady Mary among the saints, and she was saying, ""Who will go and kill that wicked man Golyad?"" And she turned round and saw a knight, a martyr who was buried in that monastery; and his horse was tethered near his weapons, and his arms were hanging up in the church, that is to say, his spear, his sword, and his shield. And our Lady Mary said unto that martyr, ""Rise up quickly, gird on thy armour, mount thy horse, and slay the enemy of my Son and my enemy, Golyad."" And he rose up straight way from out of the grave, and he took his arms, and mounted his horse and departed. And the archimandrite woke up out of his sleep, and he told his brethren what he had seen, and they went to the grave of the knight and they found that he was not in it and that it was empty. And they went into the church, and they could not find the knight's armour, and they said, ""Verily the martyr hath gone to destroy Golyad the sinner."" And the martyr scattered those who were with the horses of Golyad, and none of them saw him except Golyad. And Golyad said, ""Keep this horseman away from me for he hath come to kill me""; and as he was saying these words the martyr thrust his sword through his heart and killed him, and his soldiers were scattered. And then the martyr returned to his grave. And when the monks came again into the church, they saw his armour hanging up, and his spear was covered with clotted blood, and his horse was dripping with his sweat.

Fol. 87b, No. 69.] THERE was a certain pagan of the children of Ishmael who found in his house a picture of our Lady Mary, and he knew not whence it came, and it was ornamented and was the most beautiful of all his goods. And the pagan loved that picture exceedingly, and he cleaned it, and rubbed it, and used to stand before it and salute it. And he used to ponder in his mind and say, ""Can it possibly be true that God, the Creator of the universe, was pleased to abase Himself and come down from His glorious state and put on human flesh? I cannot believe that a virgin could conceive and bear a child without the seed of man, and that her virginity could remain undestroyed. If it were true I would certainly become a Christian and worship Christ and believe in Mary."" Thus he meditated many days. And one day, as he was standing before her, suddenly he saw on the picture two streams of liquid running down like oil and meron from the breasts of the picture. And when he saw this miracle he fell down upon the earth before the picture of our Lady Mary, and he said, ""I believe in the Christian Faith.

191,The only son of a king who dedicated himself to Saint Mary.,Europe probably,"LXII THE VIRGIN MARY AND THE PRINCE WHO REJECTED HIS BRIDE FOR HER SAKE [Brit. Mus. MS. Orient. No. 652. Fol. 88b, No. 70.] THERE was a certain king who dwelt by the sea, and he had only one son, a youth goodly, and blessed, and God-fearing. And his father, by reason of his great love for him, brought teachers to instruct him in learning of every kind, and how to direct his kingdom when he grew up, and his father set him in the church that was in his house. And the youth prayed continually to our Lady Mary, for he loved her with all his heart. Now there was a picture of our Lady Mary in the church, and the youth loved that picture, and when he had dismissed his teacher he would stand before it and salute her. And one day as he stood before the picture our Lady Mary spake unto him, and said unto him, ""O my beloved, believe in me. I have rejoiced in thy work, and I love thee exceedingly because thou hast loved me."" And when the youth heard the words of the picture he marvelled greatly and was sore afraid. And she said unto him, ""Be not afraid, for I hold con verse in the picture with those whom I love."" And the youth said unto her, ""As to thy loving me—I have spoken unto thee on many days, and thou hast not answered me."" And she said unto him, ""Now, how much dost thou love me?"" And he said unto her, ""I love thee more than my father, and my mother, and myself."" And she said unto him, ""I know that thou dost not love me with sincerity. I wish thee to take no wife except a woman who hath my likeness and form; be hold now, observe me well, so that thou mayest know what I am like."" And when the youth looked at the picture he was unable to gaze his fill at her because of the great beauty of her form and the radiance that came forth from her. And she said unto him, ""Give me thy hand [and swear] that thou wilt marry no woman except myself, for I am a jealous woman, and I am jealous about thee."" And the youth rose up and went to her, and he gave her his hand, and she gave him her hand, and he took it and kissed it twice; and because of his joy he wept. And she said unto him, ""Keep thy virginity, for he who keepeth his virginity becometh my brother, and no man in this world is able to describe his felicity. Henceforth I shall not hold converse with thee again until I come and take thee with me into the kingdom of heaven, where thou shalt be with me in everlasting joy."" And when his teacher came he saw the traces of tears on his face, and brought him out of the church. And when his father saw that he loved to sit in the church, and that he had no desire to dress and adorn himself like the children of kings and to make merry with them, he said, ""If I allow my son to indulge in this habit he will become despised among the children of the Christians and kings. I wish to obtain a wife for him, so that his eyes may be opened, and so that he may become like the other children of men; for a wife improveth a man in very many matters."" And his father obtained for him from a distant part of the country a beautiful maiden who was like unto the light of the sun, and brought her unto him. And when he had brought her to his house there gathered together in the church all the nobles and all the horsemen, and the bishop came to crown them. And the young man hid himself, and they only found him with the greatest difficulty, and they brought him sorrowing to his father. And his father rebuked him and said unto him, before the bishop, ""My son, dost thou not want this woman?"" And the young man said, ""No, I do not."" And the bishop said unto him, ""Urge him not, for he shameth his wife."" And the young man was looking out for a hiding-place, to which he might flee from them, and his father said, ""Hold him fast."" And as he fled he fell down and his neck was broken, and their joy was turned to weeping and sorrow. And as they were bearing the young man along and weeping they heard a loud and terrifying and majestic voice, and they lifted up their eyes to heaven and they saw a crowd of angels coming down to the young man. And among them was a glorious Lady of most beautiful form and appearance, and light shone from her face, and there was none able to describe (?) her. And she blessed him and said unto him, ""Behold, I have come unto thee, O my beloved, so that I may take thee with me into joy, even as I promised thee; give me thy soul."" And the young man fell asleep and delivered up his soul to her, and they heard a voice that rejoiced, and they smelled a perfume that was sweeter than any scent in the world. And they saw our Lady Mary carrying the soul of the young man, and the angels surrounding it until they reached heaven. And they were singing and rejoicing and praising God.

No. 652. Fol. 90b, No. 72.] THERE was a certain handsome young man who belonged to a noble family, and he loved eating, and drinking, and a life of luxury, but after a time his money came to an end, and his friends quarrelled with him and made a mock of him. And one day he went out from the city, and he had a friend with him, for the district was too strait for him. And as he was going along the young man remembered the exalted position and the pleasure which he had enjoyed, and then he thought of his want and misery. And he said unto his friend, ""My friend, God knoweth how much I wish that my soul would depart so that I might escape from the censoriousness of men."" And his friend said unto him, ""If thou wishest thou canst be superior to all the men of this city. I will take thee to my friend Satan; do everything that he telleth thee and he will help thee""; and the young man said, ""I will do everything he telleth me."" Then his .friend leaped upon his horse and disappeared from him, and he cried out to Satan, who appeared unto him, and he said unto him, ""Behold, I have brought unto thee another slave; keep back from him nothing that he requireth."" And Satan came to the young man in the form of a man, and said unto him, ""If thou wilt, thou shalt be my servant; swear to me that thou wilt do all I wish."" And the young man said unto him, ""I will do everything thou wishest."" And Satan said unto him, ""I wish thee to deny Christ, and the Father, and the Holy Ghost""; and the young man said, ""I will do so."" And again Satan said, ""Deny the angels""; and the young man said, ""I will do so."" And again Satan said unto him, ""And deny Mary."" And when the young man heard the mention of our Lady Mary he feared with a great fear, and said, ""God forbid that I should do this thing; if thou didst give me everything in the world I would not deny her."" And Satan said unto him, ""If thou wilt not hearken unto my voice I will take my money and depart from thee""; and Satan snatched away his friend, and they went down alive together into Sheol. And when the young man saw this great punishment he feared greatly, and he wept bitterly and went to a church that was near him, and he got down from his horse, and tied the beast to the door, and went into the church. And he found therein a picture of our Lady Mary with her Son, and he stood up before it, and he lifted up his eyes to it with weeping and lamentation. And after the young man had gone into the church, a certain very rich man came in, and he hid behind a pillar, and prayed, and made supplication to God for his soul, and he watched what the young man was doing. And shedding tears abundantly he said, ""O my Lady Mary, thou knowest that I have remembered thee and made thee an asylum at the time of my trouble, I beseech thee to be to me a mediatrix with thy darling Son, for thou art the mother of mercy, and the hope of sinners like myself""; and through his excessive weeping he fell asleep. And our Lady Mary cried out to her Son and said, O my Son, I entreat Thee to forgive this young man the sin that he hath committed."" And her Son said unto her, ""O My mother, must I do everything that thou askest Me F [If so], how will he be punished? I will not forgive him."" And when our Lady Mary heard the word of her Son she said, ""If Thou wilt not forgive him I will never again carry Thee in my arms, and I will never hold Thee in my bosom""; and she set Him down out of her arms upon the altar. And our Lord smiled and said unto her, ""Take Me up, for behold, I have forgiven him his sin""; and straightway she lifted Him up into her bosom. Now the young man had fallen upon the ground, and because of his excessive weeping had gone to sleep. And our Lady Mary called out to the rich man and said unto him, ""Hearken unto what I shall say unto thee""; and he said, ""I will hearken."" And she said unto him, ""Accept this usury for thyself (or, thy soul). Take this young man, get a wife for him, and establish him in thy house, so that thou mayest rejoice greatly."" And the rich man went to the young man, and woke him up, and embraced him and kissed him, and took him into his house, and gave him his daughter, and made him master of all his possessions.

Fol. 92b, No. 72.] THERE was a very rich man who had a most beautiful wife, and her person was wonderfully lovely, and God had endowed her with beauty of body, and grace, and a sweet voice, and there was no woman to be compared with her for loveliness in her city. And a certain rich knight came to that city, and he was of noble family, and of goodly appearance, and he was altogether lovable; and as soon as he saw that woman his heart was transfixed with the love of her. But he did not show this openly and he told no one of it, but he shewed himself friendly unto those who were her inti mate friends, and he made presents to her husband, and he yielded to his wishes, and showed him great affection, and did the things that pleased him, and he often invited him to his table, and he gave him [rich] apparel, and some of his horses. And when the knight knew that the heart of the woman's husband was turned to him, he said unto him one day in a joking manner, ""O my beloved, I wish that I and thou and thy lady wife might eat together, and I wish her to set me in her heart, just as thou thyself hast done in thy affection for me."" And the husband said, ""I agree, for my house is thy house, and we are thy servants""; and he invited the knight to his house and made ready much meat and drink, and he commanded his wife to treat him with honour. And the knight, taking with him for the wife a splendid gift of very great value, went to her, and she welcomed him with a joyful face, and with a gracious mind, and she embraced him and seated him next to her. And the knight presented to her the gift that he had brought, and she rejoiced in his gift and thanked him for his gracious kindness. And after they had eaten [the husband] rose up and departed, and the knight and the wife were left alone together. And he said unto her, ""I am dying of love for thee,"" and he told her that he would give her many gifts and everything that she could wish for with her mouth. And when the wife heard his words, she became furiously angry, and said unto him, ""Thou shalt never do such a thing as this, and it shall never happen, even if thou wert to give me everything there is in the world."" And the knight rose up and de parted sad and sorrowful in heart; but he did not cease to visit her, and he continued to give her gifts, and he persisted with her until she came to love him and agreed to do what he wished. And she made a plan with him to go out to him from her house after all the household had gone to sleep. And she went out at the time he appointed, according as they had arranged, and she could not find him, because he lived at a great distance from that place. And when she failed to find him she became angry and went back to her house; and then she meditated and said, ""I will go out again and peradventure I shall find him""; and she went out. And at the time of her going out she found a book wherein were written the Hours of our Lady Mary, and she took it in her hand and she held it in the light of the moon. And when she arrived at the place they had agreed upon she began the recital of the prayer for the dead, and the man was watching her. And when he wanted to go to her he saw many dead people, and he was afraid, and he stood still in the place where he was. And when the woman had finished the prayer for the dead she began the recital of the prayer of our Lady Mary, and the dead people disappeared. And the man saw a multitude of virgins like stars coming down from heaven, and among them was our Lady Mary who was shining more brightly than the sun and moon, and upon her head was a crown of glory set with gems of great beauty, and none could look upon her by reason of the great splendour that was upon her. And the knight threw himself upon his face when he saw this. And he looked again, and behold, he saw the virgins placing a throne which shone like lightning, and our Lady Mary sat thereon, and they lighted two lamps, and set them one on her right hand and one on her left. And our Lady Mary was watching the woman and wondering how she could pray, and when she was finishing her reading and was coming to the end of her prayer, all the virgins who were with our Lady prayed with the woman. And having finished the prayer, she rose up, and our Lady Mary went up into heaven with great glory, and the woman remained there by herself. And the knight came to her and bowed low at her feet, and said unto her, ""O woman, blessed art thou; pray thou to God for me, for I have seen a most marvellous and astonishing sight""; and he told her how he had seen the dead people and our Lady Mary. And he said unto her, ""Pray thou for me. As for me I wish to serve this Lady all the days of my life""; and he kissed and embraced the woman, and left her, and departed. And the woman returned to her house terrified and trembling because of what she had seen. And the knight sold all his possessions and gave [the price thereof] to the poor, and he assumed the garb of the ascetic life, and died in peace. And the husband of the woman died, and two months afterwards she also sold all her possessions, and built a monastery, and established monks therein; and she served God for a space of twenty years, and then she died and entered into the kingdom of heaven through the prayer of our Lady Mary.

He was rich, but his wealth was made by the goods of iniquity, because he treated his neighbors unjustly: he took their goods, their wheat and their land and did violence upon them, thanks to his wealth.</p>

<p>The angels of darkness produced the ledger of his sins, and his sins were more numerous than his beautiful actions. </p>
<p>Next the angels of darkness took him and wanted to take him into Sheol.</p>
<p>And then appeared Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary mother of God, the friend of clemency and the hope of sinners; she said to the angels of darkness, “Leave this man and go far from him, because he continued to serve me for all the days of his life in the world.”</p>
<p>Eight days later, the rich man appeared in a dream to his wife.</p>
<p>He narrated to her all that had happened to her and how he had been saved by Our Lady Mary the merciful.</p>
<p>The woman too was firm in the love of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary mother of God, and in the giving of alms to the poor and destitute for her name, until she would leave this transitory world.[Translation as of 05/21/22]</p>

And that Jew went into a church [with his friend] according to his wont, and he turned round and saw in a niche a picture of our Lady Mary, which was painted on a tablet. And he said unto his friend, ""O my friend, I adjure thee to tell me whose picture is this on the wood."" And the Christian said unto him, ""This is a picture of our Lady Mary, the boast of virgins, pure and radiant and excellent, the crown of the daughters of Eve, the adornment of the children of Adam, the mother of mercy, the light of believers, the mother of our God Jesus Christ, the Son of God, Who shall judge the living and the dead."" And when the Jew heard this he became furiously angry, and he said unto the Christian, ""Art thou not ashamed to mention the name of one who is detested among us?"" And in his exceedingly great wrath he rose up from his place, and took the picture and threw it down into the latrine. And at that moment a devil seized him, and tore his tongue out of his mouth, and the Enemy snatched him away and put him in Sheol.

Fol. 96b, No. 75.] THERE was a certain nobleman in the city of Rome, and his wife was a noble lady, and they were rich. Now they had no children and, because of their passionate desire for children, they gave alms and made offerings to the martyrs and saints, and they loved our Lady Mary with all their hearts, and they served her with all their might. And God heard their petition and accepted their prayer, and gave them a man child; and they rejoiced with a great joy. And because of his exceedingly great love for the boy his father wished to save up a hoard for him, so that no stranger might hope for his money, and he diminished his alms, and prized his money, and ceased to do the kind acts which he had done formerly. And after a few days he pondered in his mind, saying, ""Woe is me! I am a beggar because of this boy, I have ceased to do good. It is best for me to forsake the world and all that therein is, and to go and save my soul."" And he left his wife and child and went and became a monk in a certain monastery. Now the mother of the boy, because of her great love for him, never allowed him to sleep except with her. And when the boy grew up and arrived at man's estate, he learned to know women carnally, and he destroyed his virginity. And one night whilst he was lying on a couch with his mother, and they both were conversing with words of sin and joking together, Satan set the shameful thing between them, and seduced them, and at length the son committed fornication with his mother and she conceived. And she was afraid lest the neighbours should have knowledge of her act, and she concealed her conception, and she multiplied her alms, and served our Lady Mary, and looked to her to protect her. And when she brought forth her child she threw it away, and no one knew of it. And when Satan saw her act he wished to expose her because of what she had done, and to disgrace her. And he appeared in the form of a wise man (magician?), who foretold what was going to happen before it took place; and he used to overcome everyone who attempted to engage in a dispute with Satan. And his fame was noised abroad in the city of Rome, and the rumour of him reached the king, who summoned him and made him his counsellor. And one day he said unto the king, ""I am marvelling at the sin of a certain woman who dwelleth in this city""; and he told him how she had conceived by her son, and how she had hidden her conception, and how she had cast away her child in her house. And when the king heard this story he was wroth, and he said unto him, ""If this which thou tellest me be true I will do unto her according as thou shalt command; and if it be not true I will curse thee and punish thee and all who are like unto thee."" And Satan said unto him, ""I am well pleased with all thou hast said unto me."" And the king sent for the woman, and when she came before him he told her everything that she had done; and when she heard she was afraid, but the Holy Spirit made her strong because of the beauty of her works. And she said unto him, ""My lord, give me counsel""; and she received an appointment for the third day. And when she came forth from the presence of the king, she went to the bishop and confessed her sin, and he said unto her, ""Fear thou not, O my daughter, and be not sad, but receive thou everything that hath come unto thee with thanks giving, and it shall be unto thee for repentance, and thy reward shall not be blotted out before God."" And when the appointed day came she went into the presence of the king, and she rejoiced and was glad because of the salvation of her soul. And when she arrived the king said unto Satan, ""Here is the woman""; and Satan was afraid of her and said, ""This is not the woman who committed this sin,"" and he saw by her side another woman whom he could not look upon because of the brightness of her face. And Satan commanded the people to light a large fire, and the fire was smoky and covered the light of the sun. And all the people of Rome gathered together, and that woman began to speak with joy and gladness, even as the Holy Spirit made her to speak. And when Satan heard he melted away like smoke, and [though] they searched for him they found him not.

<p>At the same moment, he went into the church, approached the altar and received communion with all the pure believers.</p>
<p>Next he said to the monks, “Take me, seize me, and place a sack upon me.”</p>

200,The young man who offered the ring he had received from his girlfriend to the icon of Saint Mary.,Europe confirmed,"LXVII THE VIRGIN MARY AND THE YOUNG MAN WHO PLACED A BETROTHAL RING ON HER FINGER [Brit. Mus. MS. Orient. No. 652. Fol. 99b, No. 77.] THERE was in a certain city a church which the people wanted to [re]build, and they placed at the door an image of our Lady Mary, so that all who passed through the door might, through the agency of the picture, give alms for the work of [re]building. And before the church there was a fine open space where the youths and maidens used to gather together to enjoy themselves. And one day the deacons and other folic gathered together to enjoy themselves, and among them was the son of the deacon, and he was a very handsome youth. And he loved a certain girl who was a virgin, and she loved him, and because of the greatness of her love for him she gave him her ring, and said unto him, ""Keep this ring so that thou mayest remember me."" And he said unto her, ""I will never love another woman ""; and the ring remained with the young man, and he loved it like his own soul because of the love of that maiden. And when he was enjoying himself with the young folk he was afraid of breaking the ring, and he wanted to hand it over for safe keeping to a friend. And turning round he saw the image of our Lady Mary before the door of the church, and he went up to it and said unto it, ""Verily I say unto thee that thou art more beautiful than the woman I love, and henceforward thou shalt be my love. And this ring shall be a re minder from me that thou art my love, and I desire no other woman besides thee."" And he went and placed the ring on her finger, and the hand of the image grasped it tightly. And when the young man saw this miracle, he called the young folk to him and said, ""Come ye and see this miracle""; and he told them everything that had taken place in connection with the ring. And the men of understanding said unto him, ""Our Lady Mary wisheth thee to be her servant all the days of thy life."" But the young man would not accept their words, and he went out from their midst, and forgot the ring and the covenant. Now he belonged to a noble family. And when he had grown up [his kinsfolk] brought to him the woman whom he had loved and who loved him. And after they had gone into their bed, the young man slept a little, and our Lady Mary appeared unto him in a dream, and rebuked him, and said unto him, ""O false one, O perjured one, where is the covenant which thou didst make with me? Behold, hast thou taken a woman who is better than I am? And hast thou loved a woman who is more noble than myself? Behold, thy ring is on my finger, and I say unto thee that if thou takest another woman I will regard thy word as a lie and will take vengeance on thee."" And she appeared unto the young man as if she were a spectre between him and his wife, and he woke up in fear and trembling, and it seemed to him as though the image [of our Lady Mary] was between him and his wife, and he was groping about that peradventure he might be able to touch her. And as he meditated upon the dream that he had seen he quickly fell asleep. And again he saw in a dream the image of our Lady Mary, and she was filled with wrath against him, and she said unto him, ""If thou dost falsify thy word to me I will punish thee in this world and in the next; consider now what thou wilt do."" And then she disappeared from him. And he awoke from his dream in fear and trembling, and he meditated, saying, ""I am not a child, nor am I without understanding. In truth I did talk with Mary and say that I would be her servant, and she is seeking what is hers, and my ring is held fast by her, and I did covenant with her to serve her."" And he rose up quickly from his bed and put on his apparel, and he went out from his bridal chamber without anyone recognizing him. And he forsook his bride, and abandoned all his possessions in the world, and departed into the desert and embraced the ascetic life; and he dwelt as a solitary and served our Lady Mary. And she helped him in respect of his food and apparel, until he died and departed from this world and entered into unending life through the prayer of our Lady Mary, the worker of miracles. Budge, E.

Orient. No. 652. Fol. 103b, No. 81.] THERE was a certain monk who lived in a monastery close to a river, and he was the verger of the church; and he used to stand up before the picture of our Lady Mary and say the Angel's Salutation to it. And this monk loved a woman who lived on the other side of the river, and one night he went forth from the monastery at midnight to visit that woman, and as he was going along he said the prayer of our Lady Mary. And as soon as he entered the river, devils seized him and threw him down into the water, and he was choked and died. And the devils hovered about and surrounded his body so that they might carry off his soul, but the angels helped him and delivered it from them; and the devils said, ""His soul belongeth to us, for it hath done evil."" And our Lady Mary came and said unto them, ""O ye cursed and evil ones, let go my servant""; but the devils said, ""It is ours, for we caught him in sin."" And our Lady Mary said unto them, ""He was in my service, and ye kept him back from my service; if ye refuse I will summon you before Christ my Son."" Now the monks were wondering why midnight had passed and the board that summoned them to prayer had not been beaten. And when the monks went down into the church they found the doors open and the door of the monastery open also, and they went outside, and they found the verger lying drowned in the water; and they brought him out of the water and stood up round him, but they were unable to do anything for him. And whilst they were standing round him, he rose up and stood on his feet, and he went into the monastery and told his brethren everything that had happened to him, and confessed his sin before them. And he lived a righteous life, and died, and entered the kingdom of the heavens through the prayer of [our Lady Mary], the mother of mercy. Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933.

207,The monk who saved the church of Saint Mary in Atrib by his prayers when its destruction had been ordered by the Caliph.,Africa Egypt probably,"XXXIV THE VIRGIN MARY AND THE KHALIFAH OF ATHRIBIS [A. Fol. 81a, 1; B. Fol. 60b, 1.] O MY brethren, ye Christian people, we will relate unto you this great miracle and wonderful deed that our holy Lady, Mary the twofold Virgin, the God-bearer, wrought in the city of Athribis. There was a certain king whose title was ""Kalifa"" (i.e. Khalifah), and he reigned after his father Rashid— now the meaning of this title is ""cruel"" (or, savage), and before he had received the kingdom he set himself in opposition to the Christians, and persecuted them, and made violent attacks upon the churches. And his disposition towards them was like unto that of Paul before his conversion to the faith of Jesus Christ, when he was of the Jewish faith. Now this king chose a certain man from among his soldiers, and having appointed him general over one hundred horsemen, he com manded him to journey through all the cities and provinces of the country of Egypt, and to go round about in all the borders thereof, and to pull down and destroy the churches, and everything that was therein. And this man came unto the city of Athribis, that is to say, to that portion of the boundary of its territory that is opposite to the village wherein they make honey. Now there was in the city an exceedingly large church, which had been built in the name of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-bearer. And in the church there were four doors, and in these four doors were four shrines, and above the four shrines were four canopies, which were supported by one hundred and sixty pillars, all of which were hewn out of white stone, and between each pillar was a distance of forty cubits. Each pillar was carved all over with vine branches, and the hollow (or, capitals) of them were sculptured and ornamented with cunning work in stone, and they were encircled with bands of gold and silver. And there were in the church four and twenty saints' chapels, and in them were placed four and twenty Tabernacles of the Law (i.e. the arks that contained the Eucharistic Elements). And in one of these chapels was an image of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-bearer, which was sculptured and inlaid with mother-of-pearl, and this image was apparelled in a garment that was made of the purple of Constantinople. And near the image of the Virgin Mary were sculptured the figures of two angels (i.e. Michael and Gabriel) which stood one on each side of it. And the lamps that were hanging before the image were made of gold and silver, and they ceased not to burn by day and by night, and [the servants of the church] kept them supplied and filled with oil. Now there lived in that church a certain monk who was the chief priest, and his name was John. He was a virgin, and a righteous man, and he kept diligently the laws of the church in respect of the seasons for prayer, and for the consecration of the Eucharist, both by day and by night, without ceasing. And God was well-pleased with him by reason of the beauty of his righteousness, and his gentleness, and his humility. But let us return to the beginning of our story: When the general of the king's host had arrived at the church, he took up his abode on the bank of the Nile, and they pitched his tents there so that he might rest a few days. And the people of the city were greatly disturbed because they heard that the general had come to pull down the church, and to destroy the fair beauty of the building which had been built in the name of our holy Lady, Mary, the twofold Virgin, the God-bearer, and that he was about to make an end of the words of the priests thereof who used to proclaim the true faith therein. And the people informed the holy man John concerning this thing, and when he heard it he became sad and exceedingly sorrowful. Then he girded up his loins in the strength of the Holy Spirit Who dwelt in him; and he rose up and prayed unto God in bitterness of heart. And after he had made an end of his prayer and of the supplication which he offered up with much crying, he left his house and departed unto the place where the general was sitting in his tent. And when the servants of the general saw him they said unto the holy man John, ""Why hast thou come here, O monk, and what dost thou desire?"" And John answered and said unto them, ""Behold, I have the wish that ye should announce me quickly to the general, for there is a word that I would speak with him, and it must be spoken between us two in private""; so the servants departed and made known to the general concerning him, and he made them bring John into his presence. Then John gave him the salutation of ""Peace,"" with modesty and humility of spirit. And the general welcomed him, and said unto him, ""And to thee also be peace with the mercy of God."" And again the general said unto him, ""O monk, hast thou the de sire to seek ought from me?"" Then John the monk said unto him, ""Yea, my lord. I wish thee to take me unto some place where there is no man except thyself, so that I may speak unto thee in private the word that I have to say."" And the general commanded those who were round about him to withdraw, and there remained no one [with them] except the friend who was the general's chief counsellor, and who lay in his bosom. Then the general said unto him, ""O monk, declare what thy heart desireth."" And John said unto him, ""O my lord and master, behold now I have heard that thou hast come hither to pull down the church, and to destroy the fair beauty of the edifice thereof, which hath been built in the name of our holy Lady, Mary, the twofold Virgin, the God-bearer, the church that is the oldest and fairest of all the churches [of Egypt]. And behold, I entreat God, and I make supplication unto thee also that thou wilt come and walk about a little in the courtyard and in the broad aisles of the church, so that thou mayest be able to see the building thereof, and its foundations, and the pavement of the courtyard, and the boundary of its walls, and the roof of the building that is over the shrines, and its pillars and its vaulted roofs, which are inlaid with gold and silver and shining mother-of-pearl. Come now, that thou mayest look upon the church before the order for the destruction thereof goeth forth from thy mouth."" Then he who was the chief counsellor and friend of the general said unto him, ""O Master, the words of this old man have weight, and to them attacheth a meaning; it will do thee no harm to look upon the church; on the contrary, it will do thee good. Rise up, then, that thou mayest see the church—for the way [thither] is short—even though the beauty of the building may not please thee."" And it came to pass that when the general had heard what his chief counsellor, who lay in his bosom, said unto him, he rose up quickly and walked round about through the courts and colonnades of the church with a doubtful mind, whilst the old man John waited upon him in the path. And when the general and his counsellor had come into the church, and had looked about it, they marvelled at the beauty of its disposition and arrangement, and at the dignity of each and all of its splendid adornments, and at its venerable appearance, and at its doors. Then the general said unto John, ""O monk, how exceedingly beautiful is this church! The lowermost structure is pleasing, and the building itself is magnificent and of most marvellous beauty. But what shall we say concerning it? For the King Khalifah hath commanded us to pull down the churches and to overthrow the houses of idols, and for this reason we dare not transgress by the least jot or tittle the words of his command."" And the old man John answered and said unto the general in a humble voice, ""Master, thy word is true. But I pray thee to hearken unto the words that I would speak before thee, for the things that I wish to say unto thee are good and not evil."" Then the general said unto him, ""What are the good words that thou couldst speak that would please me? But speak, I pray thee."" And the old man John said unto him, ""O my lord, grant me a boon, and wait patiently for three days before thou destroyest this church—now for each day of the delay I will pay thee one hundred dinars—until a letter with commands from the king shall reach thee; and after the three days are ended then shall it be as God Almighty willeth. And if a letter with commands reach thee [good and well]; and if not, then do as thou wishest."" Now when the general, together with his friend and counsellor, had heard these words from John the priest, he laughed at him, and derided him, and said unto him, ""O aged man, between us and the country of Mace donia is it not a journey that would require a space of two months to perform by those who would travel thither? And to return hither would also require two months, that is to say, added together the number of the months is four, and yet thou sayest unto me, Wait patiently for three days until a letter with commands from the king shall reach thee."" And the counsellor said unto the general,"" These Christians grow old and their brains dry up in the years of their old age, and their understanding groweth gradually less, and they become stupid through praying and fasting overmuch; and they destroy their intellect with food made of gar den herbs, and lentils and pulse. But now I will give thee counsel that shall be pleasing unto thee: Take from this old man the three hundred dinars, for they will pay that which thou owest; a letter with commands from the king cannot reach thee in three days, and after that period thou canst do as thou wishest."" Then straightway the general said unto the blessed old man, ""I consent, and I will wait patiently for thee until three days are ended, and in accordance with what thou sayest I will not pull down the church."" And John the priest said unto him, ""Now therefore, establish a covenant with me, and swear an oath before our holy Lady, Mary the twofold Virgin, the God-bearer, that thou wilt not change these thy words, and that thou wilt not deceive me."" Then they made a covenant together, and they established an agreement, and the general took an oath before God at the shrine of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary. And straightway the governor went forth from the church with his counsellor, and he tarried in the place where he was living for three days; and the general and the counsellor to gether derided the blessed old man, and they laughed his folly to scorn. Then John the priest said unto his companions, ""Shut ye fast the doors of the church upon me, and bolt them with the bolts thereof, so that none of you may be able to draw nigh unto me and to visit me for three days and three nights."" And having said these words he went into the sanctuary of the church, and stood up before the image of our holy Lady, Mary the twofold Virgin, the God-bearer. And his mind was carried away into heaven, and he began to pray with exceedingly great watchfulness, and he made abundant supplication with discretion and understanding. He wept with a bitter weeping, and scalding tears flowed from his eyes and covered his cheeks. And he bathed himself in the flood of tears that rolled down from his weeping upon the place where his holy feet stood; and he grieved and mourned with sore lamentation lest he should see the destruction of the church. Then, as he stood up before the image of our Lady, he said, ""O my holy Lady, Mary, thou twofold Virgin, the God-bearer, who deliverest those who commit themselves unto thee, who receivest into thy safe keeping those who flee unto thee for refuge, O my Lady, thou Queen of heaven and earth, behold, the time hath arrived for thee to pray and to make supplication unto thy beloved Son, our Lord and Redeemer, Jesus Christ. O my Lady, He Who was brought forth by thee is holy, and He is called the Son of God the Most High, and the Lord God hath given unto Him the throne of David His father. He shall rule the house of Jacob for ever, and His kingdom shall have no end, and He shall perform for thee every thing that thou shalt ask from Him. Now hath the time drawn nigh for the manifestation of thy power over thine enemies who wish to overthrow Thy holy place. Arise, do battle with thine enemies and let them not escape; destroy thou their counsel, and let them not say, 'Ha, ha, we have seen with our eyes the dis grace, and the destruction, and the misery of the place' wherein thou dwellest. O my Lady, I entreat thee and I adjure thee by the Holy Word Whom thou didst carry for nine months and five days—that is, until the time when He was brought forth by thee—and Whom thou didst suckle at thy breast; and I entreat thee and I ad jure thee by God, His Father, not to punish always, and not to be angry forever, O thou who art tender of heart and whose mercies towards the children of men are abundant. And I entreat thee and I adjure thee by thy prayer which is received before the eyes of thy Son, to make manifest this day the might of thy miraculous power, O my Lady, thou Lady of angels and of men."" With these words and with others like unto them did John make supplication, and he wept by day and by night, and he ceased not to watch, and to pray, and to prostrate himself before her with words and deeds of service; and he neither ate nor drank, and he tasted no food with his lips until the end of the three days. And it came to pass that, behold on the third day, at the eleventh hour of the night, after cockcrow but before the daylight had come, our Lady, Mary the twofold Virgin, who gave birth to God, and who is tender of heart unto those who make supplication unto her with abundance of tears and with a broken spirit, appeared unto him in visible form from out of her image, and she poured forth from her lips grace upon John. And she said unto him, ""O priest John, behold God hath received all thy petition that thou hast made unto Him concerning the destruction of the house of my sanctuary, and from this time forward thou shalt not be sorrowful, neither shall thy soul weary itself with toil. For this night I have commanded the King Khalifah to write a letter and to send it to this general [commanding him] not to overthrow the house of my sanctuary. And behold, the letter that containeth these commands shall arrive quickly from Macedonia, yea, it shall come in this same hour, as it were in the twinkling of an eye; and it is written with his own hand and beareth his own words ordering the general neither to plunder nor to pull down this church. And now, fear not, and let not thine heart be dismayed, but be strong in the strength of God, and cease thou to afflict thyself grievously, and weary not thy soul with toil, for no man hath power over the house of my sanctuary. For the Father of my beloved Son is the pillar thereof, and my Only Son is the ground upon which it standeth, and the Holy Spirit is the foundation and base thereof."" And having said these words and given him the salutation of peace she disappeared from him. Now when the priest John heard the gracious words and the utterances of the mouth of our holy Lady, Mary the twofold Virgin, the God-bearer, at that moment, I say, the gracious gift of joy and gladness came upon him, and he exulted and found rest through the Holy Spirit. And he put on strength and bowed down before the image of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-bearer, and he sang praises unto her name with sweet songs. See now, O my beloved breth ren, how exceedingly mighty was the prayer of this good, and pure, and righteous man! It was even as the Apostle said, ""The prayer of the righteous man hath power, ""I and it giveth help and maketh a man to have dominion. Meanwhile the general was lying upon his bed fast asleep in his tent, and his tent was firmly closed and a lamp was burning by his side. And at the very moment [i.e. when Mary was talking to John], he awoke from his sleep, and saw there by the light of the lamp a white dove which had dropped a sealed letter from his beak. Then, marvelling greatly at this thing, he enquired of his servant and said unto him, ""Whence did he come? And how did this white dove enter the tent, seeing that it is firmly closed and that the wings thereof are fastened with pegs?"" And his servant said unto him, ""I know neither whence he hath come, nor by what means he hath entered the tent, but only that I saw him drop a sealed letter from his beak, and that the letter was sealed with the seal of the king."" Then straightway the white dove vanished before their eyes. And the general said, ""Behold, my soul is moved, and my heart is confused by reason of this thing."" And he rose up quickly and took the letter in his hand, and he opened it and read it by the light of the lamp; and he found that the letter was in the handwriting of the king himself, and that the ink wherewith the king's own words had been written was wet, as though they had just been written. And the letter spake thus: ""Letter from the King Khalif ah unto the general in command of one hundred soldiers mounted on horses, whom I commanded to go and travel round about through the borders of Egypt, and to overthrow the churches of the Christians. Know now, and understand, O general, concerning the people whom God, the Most High, loveth, for thou shalt do no harm either unto them or unto the church that is in the city of Athribis, or unto the [other] churches that are within the borders of Egypt. But when thou hast read this letter, which containeth mine own words and is written by mine own hand, thou shalt rise up straight way, and quickly and in all haste thou shalt come unto me. Furthermore, as concerning the church in the city of Athribis which hath been built in the name of our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, the God-bearer, I desire that it shall not be harmed, or destroyed, or desecrated in any way whatsoever. Behold, I have written this letter at the eleventh hour of the night, and in testimony thereof I set my seal."" And thereafter followed the seal that the king had set to the letter, and was understood between him and the general. And it came to pass that when the general had seen and read the letter he marvelled exceedingly, and he found the matter very hard to understand; and fear and trembling laid hold upon him. Then he said unto his chief counsellor, ""Take with thee four young men and go and bring hither quickly the old man the monk, who was in the church."" And the young men went quickly and searched for him with much toil, and they found him in the church praying; and they took him and brought him to the general. And when the general saw him afar off, he went forth to meet him with a bright, and glad, and joyful countenance, and he said unto him, ""O servant of God, sit thou down, and tell me where thou hast been from the day we parted until this day."" Then John the priest said unto him, ""I remained in the church praying unto God Almighty that He would look upon my lowly estate, and that He would not let me see the destruction of the church. And at a certain time our Lady, who is in the image, appeared unto me, and she told me how a letter had come unto thee which contained the royal commands, bidding thee to desist from the attempt to destroy the church. Then straightway I ascribed praise unto God Almighty, the Most High, Who is to be praised, and I gave thanks unto the holy Lady, the Virgin Mary, for the deliverance of the church from destruction."" And the governor said unto him, ""Yea, what thou hast said is true, and thy words are right. Behold, a letter containing the royal commands of my lord the king hath just reached me from the beak of a white dove. But I cannot understand by what means the dove that dropped into my tent from his beak the letter containing the royal commands of my lord the king, written by his own hand, hath reached me. And the king hath commanded me to desist from the attempt to destroy the church, and to go [back] to him. And now, O priest, I know the intercession of our Lady Mary, and the power of her help, and that her Son doeth for her everything that she asketh Him [to do], therefore rise up, and let us go to the church, and let us pray before the image of our holy Lady, Mary the twofold Virgin, that she will help me and make prosperous my way."" Then straightway they rose up and went together to the church, and John the priest prayed a prayer that was fitting, and the general himself prayed unto our holy Lady, the Virgin Mary. And he gave unto the church one hundred dinars, and the three hundred dinars of gold, concerning which he made three days before a covenant that John the priest should give him, he re mitted unto him. Then the general bade John the priest farewell, and departed from him in peace; and he set out on his journey to Macedonia, giving thanks unto God Almighty, and marvelling at the wonderful and miraculous thing that he had seen. And it came to pass that at the end of two months the general arrived in the country of Macedonia, and when he entered into the presence of the king he saluted him; and he and his soldiers bowed down before him; and the king was exceedingly glad to see him, and he gave him the salutation of peace. Then the king made those who were standing about him to withdraw, and he said unto the general, ""Did the letter containing my royal commands which I sent unto thee in the beak of a white dove reach thee?"" And the general said unto him, ""Yea, it reached me in the night, just before daybreak, and I have come, even as thou didst com mand me to come, and here is the letter with me now ""; and he shewed the letter unto the king. Then the king marvelled and said unto him, ""Is this thing indeed true?"" And the general said unto him, ""O my lord, I swear unto thee by the Living God that this great mystery, which hath never been imagined in the heart of man, hath been made manifest unto me. Tell me by what means thou didst send it unto me, for I have never heard of a thing like unto this."" Then the king said unto him, ""Behold, I will tell thee. Three days before I wrote this letter unto thee a great and marvellous thing happened unto me. At the first hour of the night, whilst I was asleep, I saw a fire burning brightly in my palace, in the hall of my kingdom, and the light thereof illumined the whole earth. And I said unto my soul, What is this that hath happened unto me this day? And when I had come into my palace, a man who shone with light said unto me, Behold, knowest thou not that our holy Lady, Mary the twofold Virgin, the God- bearer, hath come and entered into thy palace? Rise up and do homage unto her. And again I heard a mighty noise which was greater than the roars and crashings of thunders and lightnings, and there were present beings who uttered loud cries of joy and exultation, and the sweet sounds of the singing of praises which were like unto the sound of an organ. Then there went forth from her a voice which said unto me, Who commanded thee to make thyself a foe unto the house of my sanctuary which is in the city of Athribis? And why hast thou given orders to destroy it? And I spake unto her with words of fear, saying, Forgive me this thing, O my Lady, for I have given no command to do this thing, and I have no knowledge whatsoever of the matter. And she said unto me, If thou dost not write a letter ordering that the house of my sanctuary shall not be overthrown thou shalt die an evil death. And again on the night of the following day that voice came unto me in the same manner, and spake unto me from the place where the Lady Mary was, saying, Didst thou not say unto me yesterday that thou wast not a foe unto the house of my sanctuary that is in the city of Athribis?"" And I said unto her in great trepidation, Behold, I have heard thy command, and I have received the voice of thy words, and I will write unto [my] general, even as thou hast commanded me, O my Lady. And when the morning came I again neglected to do the command of my Lady, and in the folly of my heart I forgot the vision. And on the night of the third day I saw for the third time the form and appearance [and heard] that voice, though I know not how. But it made me to get up from my bed and made me to stand upon my feet, and then a mighty dread, which tore me asunder and made all my members to tremble, fell upon me. And that voice spake once again, and said unto me, I will not have compassion upon thee in my mercy, but I will destroy thee quickly, both soul and body, and I will wipe out the memorial of thee from off the earth, because thou hast transgressed the word of my com mand. Behold, I have appeared unto thee three times in three nights, and I have told thee not to make thy self a foe unto the house of my sanctuary that is in the city of Athribis, and not to overthrow the building thereof. But now, write a letter of command, and send it quickly unto the general whom thou hast despatched to overthrow the churches; do now according to what I say unto thee."" Then I bowed low before her, and I said unto her, O my Lady, if I write a letter of command, who shall take and bring it unto the general? for the country wherein he is is afar off. And she said unto me, Do thou write according as I have commanded thee, and God Almighty will decree who shall take it to him. Then I wrote the letter straightway, with great and anxious care, for she was holding my hand. And there came unto me a white dove, and when she had drawn nigh she took the letter, which was sealed, from my hand with her beak at the eleventh hour of the night, and she departed from me and winged her flight upwards in the air; and I watched her until she disappeared from my sight. And thou didst say unto me, A white dove came unto me at the twelfth hour of the night, and dropped the letter from her beak into my tent. Our holy Lady, Mary the twofold Virgin, the God -bearer, hath wrought this hard and astonishing matter, the like of which I have neither heard of nor seen. Behold, from now and henceforth we shall understand and know well the helpfulness and greatness of her marvellous acts. From this day onwards we will abide in the hope of our holy Lady, and by the good pleasure of God, the Most High, let us persevere in the love of her, and let us study diligently to strive and to attain unto the salvation of our souls. And we will build a house in her name."" Then the king commanded them to build a church of beautiful appearance and splendid form, and they built a church nigh unto his palace; and they made the building thereof exceedingly beautiful. And the king prayed, and worshipped, and celebrated the Eucharist therein on the festivals of the commemoration of the Virgin Mary, and he caused to be painted a picture of our holy Lady, Mary the twofold Virgin, the Godbearer, whose name is sweet, the life of all the world, at the mere mention of whose name homage is fitting; and he continued to worship in the church all the days of his life. And that picture wrought many signs and wonders for him until he departed from this world and entered into the kingdom of the heavens. And all the people and the officers who were under his authority were gathered together in that church on the day of the festival of our Lady, and they paid honour unto her and loved her exceedingly; and it existeth even unto this day. A miracle of thy love, O flower of Hanna, was made known to the Khalifah. A bird, bearing a parchment letter containing royal commands, set out on its flight And at thy behest brought it unto a land afar off.

<p>He had gold, money, and precious clothing, servants and maids, bulls and steers, sheeps and goats, horses and mules, donkeys and camels - his wealth was very considerable.</p>
<p>Then occurred a deadly plague. It assailed the town of the man and many of his servants died.</p>
<p>He felt a great suffering and began to beg Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, Mother of God, to save him from this evil, him and the people of his house.</p>
<p>Our Lady Mary, who does not neglect the prayer of those who pray to her, heard his prayer immediately and did not neglect it.</p>
<p>One day, while he slept, the man saw a church grandly constructed, the structure was equally high; its right corner was close to the east,  and it had a window.</p>
<p>There appeared a fire in front of this window, outside of the structure of the church, from underneath the roof (?). </p>
<p>Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, Mother of God, went out the window under the appearance of a bird smaller than a dove, whose color resembled that of the heavens. She batted her wings, put out the fire, and reentered by the window.</p>
<p>The fire appeared again there where it had appeared previously.</p>
<p>The bird went again out the window and put out the fire by batting its wings, as previously.</p>
<p>Then the bird descended and its color became white from head to tail.</p>

210,"Thecla cycle: Thecla is taken to Alexandria to see her brother, Abba Esi, in a boat guided by the Archangels Gabriel and Sureyal (beginning of story)",,"<p> There was a man of the name Paesi and Thècle his sister, among the people of Abousir of the district of Echmouneïn .</p>
<p>        Paési had a friend among the people of the city of Alexandria, of the name Paul the Syrian, honored and virtuous.</p>
<p>        That man there, while he was in the city of Alexandria, suffered from a grave malady, to the point of brushing against death.</p>
<p>        He dispatched to his friend Paési, (making) it said to him, “My brother, hasten yourself to come so that I may see you before dying.”</p>
<p>        Paési rose and went in haste to the city of Alexandria.</p>
<p>        He arrived beside his friend Paul, saying, “Paési was called for the combat  of the martyr.”</p>
<p>        He bore numerous torments for the.name of Christ.</p>
<p>        As he was late, his sister Thècle left Abousir to go to Alexandria, in order to know that which had become of her brother.</p>
<p>        She went quickly beside the river of the city of Antinopolis [Antinoé]. She found a spiritual boat that took her to the exterior (of the city).</p>
<p>        Gabriel the prophet [l’annonciateur] found her there. The angel Souriel held himself before her.</p>
<p>        Our Lady the pure Virgin was sitting there.</p>
<p>        Elisabeth, the mother of John the Baptist [Jean Baptiste], was sitting next to her.</p>
<p>        Thècle went and approached the angels, because they seemed to be the masters of the boat. When Thècle reached the boat, the angels welcomed her, having taken on the appearance of sailors, and took her into the boat.</p>
<p>        They spread out a mat for her beside the blessed women and detached their boat.</p>
<p>        They started on their route then, because the wind was favorable to them by the will of God.</p>
<p>        Thècle said to the women, “Greetings to you, holy and blessed.”</p>
<p>        The women said to her in return, “Sister of the blessed, greetings to you. Welcome beside us, our sister.”</p>
<p>        (All) greatly rejoiced.</p>
<p>Thècle said to the angels, “Take from these provisions, from that which we have, food which you may eat.”</p>
<p>They said to her, “We do not have the custom of approaching people’s goods; indeed, if your goods disappear, you will imagine that it is us that took them. But if you want to give us something to eat, order your servant to present it to us, from their hand.”</p>
<p>Holy Thècle ordered her servant to take and present them bread, fish, a little honey and a little wine.</p>
<p>The servant did so.</p>
<p>        As for Thècle, it seemed to her that (the angels) were eating.</p>
<p>        When it was evening, Thècle saw that the face of the women had changed, and they were sad. She offered them the word [adressa la parole] and said to them, “My ladies, why do I see you so: you have a tormented heart?”</p>
<p>        Elisabeth said to her, “My sister, I will tell you that which has happened to me, by which I am distressed. I gave birth to a son after becoming old. I did not cease to rejoice in him. But one killed him after the murder of his father, there are long days, because of the name of God, our Savior Jesus Christ. Behold that one of his companions of the city of Alexandria has been called now to the (supreme) wedding [aux noces suprêmes].”</p>
<p>        Then Our Lady, the mother of life and treasure of clemency, spoke to Thècle.</p>
<p>        She said, “There remains for me only one son. One took him from my by jealousy and crucified him on the wood.”</p>
<p>        Thècle responded to them and said to them, “Truly, my ladies, a great misfortune has touched you. Only, I want you to tell me what city you are from.”</p>
<p>        They said to her, “We are from Jerusalem, the city of God – glory to him!”</p>
<p>        Then Our Lady said, “I entered once in the city of Echmouneïn. My infant son was suckling milk. When he had passed thirty years, one took him from me, crucified him on the wood and killed him. Behold that now, we have been called to the supreme wedding of the city of Alexandria. We are going to that.”</p>
<p>        Thècle said to them, “Who said to the fiancé that you had been called to their wedding from this faraway city?”</p>
<p>        Our Lady Mary mother of God said to her, “We go beside Paul the Syrian, because he made a great wedding for his friend Paési who is of the people of Abousir.”</p>
<p>        Thècle said to them, “I am the sister of Paési, my lords.”</p>
<p>        The angel Gabriel took the word and said to her, “We know you and we know your sister and father: are you not the daughter of Elijah [Élie], our companion? If we had not known you at first, we would not have taken you into our boat, with these blessed and honored ladies.”</p>
<p>        When Thècle heard these words, she hastened alas to give orders to her servant; she took out white bread, good wine, and fresh fish and brought them before the angels.</p>
<p>She implored them and said to them, “I want you to scrutinize my heart, spare [épargniez] my poverty and eat from these provisions of your servant.”</p>
<p>They appeared to her under the appearance of eating this food.</p>
<p>As for the pure mother of life, she said to Thècle, “You have made proof of mercy with us today during our voyage: until now you did not know us. We, we will stay with you, with your brother and your son.”</p>
<p>Likewise, the.angels held to Thècle this speech.</p>
<p>Thècle said to them, “Pardon, my lords, I am not worthy to extend the hand and eat with you. Indeed, it is not suitable for the servant to take the food and eat with his master.”</p>
<p>That happened at night [Cela se produisit de nuit] and there was no moon and no stars (?).</p>
<p>There was on the boat a light that shined brighter than the light of the sun.</p>
<p>Thècle said to Our Lady Mary, mother of life, “I have never seen such a boat, which moves forward without impetus. And in such a manner, as we were sitting on the ground, this boat cleaves (the water ?) without the need for sailors to pilot their boat from one place to another, because the wind allies with them and blows where they wish. Because of that, I am strongly astonished, (and also) because I see a light shining above us.”</p>
<p>Our Lady Mary, mother of life, said to her, “Have you not heard in the holy Gospel, where Our Lord Jesus Christ was – at his mention returns glory – with his disciples in the boat, ‘The sea was agitated above them, the Savior rose, he reprimanded the sea and there was a grand calm at that moment ’?”</p>
<p>We now, we are the disciples of this Christ.</p>
<p>As Our Lady Mary was saying that, encouraging the happy Thècle, they arrived in Alexandria.[Translation as of 05/21/22]</p>

218,"The story of Awr, the son of the princess and the magician, Abrasit.",,"<p>There was a king in a certain city called Muḍa'ä Ḍäḥäy [ሙፃአ ፀሐይ. Maybe Heliopolis; Where the Sun Rises (Sets?), but it is north of Fayum, basically Cairo]. </p>
<p></p>
<p>And he had a great sorcerer whose name was Abrasit [አብራሲት], perfect in all his sorcery. And all the time, at every moment, Abrasit praised the demons and bowed down to them. And they answered him and they did what he wished. And as for the children of that sorcerer, they were [also] skilled in sorcery. </p>
<p></p>
<p>As for the king, he was unaware of the [children’s] sorcery. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Now, the king had a daughter who was his first-born child. And her beauty was pleasing and her face and her figure were delightful and Abrasit wanted to sleep with her. He did not cease to follow her until [she slept with him and] she conceived. </p>
<p></p>
<p>And after this she bore him a son whose appearance was pleasing. And she named him Awr አውር [Arabic word means genitals, or defective, hinder, adopt, to seize, grip, befall--blind?; እውር means “Blind” in Gz]. And after this, the child grew up and was raised. </p>
<p>When he was eight years old, the king saw the boy one day and inquired [about him], “Whose son is this child?” </p>
<p></p>
<p>And they revealed to the king the secret about this child. And he became furious enough to kill Abrasit. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Immediately, Abrasit leapt up and hastily gathered his two children and Awr, whom he had fathered on the king’s daughter. He then left to go on the journey to Jerusalem, and [on the way] they went to the land of Egypt and they stayed in the city of Fayum. While they were there, their father Abrasit the Sorcerer died. </p>
<p></p>
<p>But Abrasit’s children built a house/fortress in that place. And they lived in it for a long time, calling out to the angels, each by their name, to get the angels to teach them and swear [fealty] with a vow. So, the angels came to them and they did what the children requested and wanted them to do.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But one day, while they were sitting [outside] to the west [where darkness dwells, opposite from the sun] of the house/fortress, doing their sorcery as was their habit, behold, the archangel Gabriel and the general of the heavenly host Michael, along with Our Lady Mary, the Virgin Two-fold, Mother of God, Holy and Chosen [appeared]! </p>
<p></p>
<p>And, look, they came to Abrasit’s children and said to them, “What are you looking to do here?” </p>
<p></p>
<p>And then they answered her, saying to the Mother of God, Mary, the Two-Fold Virgin, with puny [and wicked] hearts, “We are hoping, our dear Lady, that you will give us a little bit of milk from your breast so that we can drink it and escape from eternal death [without salvation]. For we have a treasury with a lot of gold, silver, and pearls, and we don’t have anyone to inherit from us.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>When Mary heard this, she pointed to Gabriel so that he might smite them down with punishment. And when the youth Awr saw the great punishment about to come down upon them, [he became terrified and] he sought sanctuary with the archangel Gabriel. </p>
<p></p>
<p>And our Lady, who is the Lady of All of Us, the Free, Mother of Mercy, the Mother of God, the Pure, the Holy, Mary, the Two-fold Virgin, with compassion and mercy commanded the archangel Gabriel [to not smite them]. And Our Holy Lady Mary, the Two-fold Virgin, was merciful and removed their fear. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Behold, O Christians, the generosity and compassion of Our Lady, Holy Mary, the Two-fold Virgin, who does not despise a sinner. Behold how she saved and liberated the evil demon sorcerers who were not [even] baptized in the name of her illustrious son. May her prayer be with her servant.[Translation as of 05/21/22]</p>

<p>And when the virgin said this to the Savior, all sinners loudly rejoiced because of their Mother Mary’s compassion. </p>
<p>And then the Savior said to her: “Oh my mother, you asked for favors today; and because of them, I rejoice today and say to you: Oh my mother, because of this I will take pity on all creation; for you asked for this on behalf of my creation not by your will, but by the will of my father and on behalf of his creation; and at once, overflowing compassion touched their hearts. Since you have looked on my creation with your pity, the Apostles above will pronounce your memory across time so that everyone will praise you and will be compassionate to the poor in memory of your blessed day.” </p>
<p>And at once, the Savior ordered the intercession of his mother Mary to be commemorated, and he commanded all torturers who dwelt in darkness [qui sunt in tenebris, qui sunt cruciatores] to release all of those Christian souls who were tormented. He said: “I declare that no soul of those who are baptized in my name will remain in torment, and they will all be freed and will all come saying with a great cry: ‘Our Lord Jesus Christ, your grace and your pity touches all of us among the living because of your pure virgin mother’s supplication.’”  </p>

Henceforth on this day, tell your sons the apostles to proclaim your memory in every corner of the earth, since whoever observes your memory on the pure day you asked for and on the day of your ascension into heaven, on the sixteenth day of Nahase,  and whoever eagerly observes that day in memory of your Sacrifice, look, when they leave their bodies, I will display their souls among the congregation of the Firstborn in the heavens. And whoever writes the book of the blessed acts you have done and your ascension into heaven, I will write his name in the book of life; and whoever builds a sanctuary in your name, I will give to him and to his sons an eternal home in the kingdom of heaven; and whoever clothes a naked person on behalf of your name, I will dress in a garment of light in a tent of light; and whoever offers sacrifice or incense in your name, I will give to him the blessing of paradise. Tell the disciples to make this known in today’s Liturgy [Sacrificium] across the whole world so that there will be peace and compassion because of it every year for all souls who are tormented.” </p>

And assuredly, I did not understand the things that had happened to me nor my return [from the previous vision of the assumption], when I found my spirit in Mary’s home in Asia. Again, a crowd approached me and many said to me: “Where on earth did your father [Saint] John go?”  </p>
<p>And I said to them: “He is in the place where the source [causa; lit. “cause,” “reason”] of the prophecy went.” </p>
<p>And while I was saying this, I saw myself standing to the right with my father [Saint] John. His face was full of light and joy and the [pleasant] scent of his garments smelled vividly and he said to me in the crowd: “Peace to you all, you who did not neglect celebrating in fellowship continuously. You administered the Eucharist on the next day and the day after and made known the mysteries which he had seen, the things which had occurred to the body of the blessed pure virgin and her home at the time of the assumption, since she is now in the dwelling of light that the Lord created, that is to say the foundation [crux; lit. “cross” or “beam”] of the sacred dwellings and the dwellings of his mother the virgin from the beginning of time. </p>
<p>“And now he himself [Jesus] beseeches his Father for all time, saying: ‘O Father, give me the portion of your glory that was mine before time. Now [give us], the virgin mother and her son, all honor and glory, because she was his dwelling on the earth, her holy womb in which he lived. Truly, it was Mary who was his [my] mother; and therefore the glory of the holy cross is owed to her. And likewise all the soldiers glorifying my holy resurrection and all eyes who watched my glory on the holy cross [are owed to her]. While my light was shining, my mother Mary was standing at my right hand.’”  </p>
<p>My father [Saint] John said these things to the crowd. And then he ordered me to write them all in a book and to copy them in multiple manuscripts so that they would pronounce the memory of our lady the pure virgin across the whole world and so that humanity could not pretend that her tomb is in the valley of Josaphat, nor would they say that her corpse is there; for it is by no means there. But let her tomb be remembered, just as our Lord Jesus Christ had ordered, so that her memory will not depart from Earth until the day of his holy resurrection, when he will summon his angels to assemble all the peoples and he will judge them, when his mother will beg on behalf of the assembly of all sinners that he extend compassion to them who were baptised in his  holy name. </p>
<p>This is the testimony of my father [Saint] John on the transitus of the blessed one and her ascension into heaven on the sixteenth day of the month of Nahase, so that whoever observes this commemoration zealously–if they have done so–their soul will be worthy to cross over and take their inherited place among peace and good, which last for all time.

These are they who kept their virginity from their youths and spilled their blood for the sake of the Name of my beloved son. Now, upon that board which you received from that rich man, take care not to paint my icon upon it, for the grace of the Lord has not come down upon it, as it is written: “But let not the oil of sinners annoint my head.” Instead, when you get up in the morning, go east to the entrance of the former church and dig two cubits into the earth.

Taking with me the archpriest Ira, the priest Theodore, and the deacons Felicius and Anestimos, I went to the place which my Lady showed me in the vision. I dug a little more than two cubits and found the board. Its appearance was like live coals and from top to bottom it was covered with a silk wrapping. When I saw it, I rejoiced greatly and said, ‘Truly this day is the day of peace which my Lady showed me.’ And when I uncovered wrapping which was around the board, I saw the face of the icon of Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin Mary, the Birth-giver of God, its radiant beauty shining gratly. I prostrated and, after I knelt to the icon, I was blessed. </p>

<p>“The icon, though, was very wide. We thought, ‘How will we lift this great icon?’ and the board moved from its place. It went out from the hole with its wrapping atop it and I marvelled at its size. We thought, ‘How will we carry it, given its width?’ Having heard us, a voice came out of the board upon which was painted the icon of Our Lady, saying, ‘How they neglect my carrying! Behold, my burden will be light and beautiful. For you, carrying it will not be strenuous.’ When I heard this voice, I rejoiced along with the priests who were with me. We picked up the board by its sides and brought it to the church, leaving it in front of the altar before we erected the pillars of the church.</p>

<p>“The congregation, when they saw the board, marvelled at its greatness. The icon, though, was covered with a wrapping and they did not know that an icon was painted on the board.

258,Saint Basil cycle: Saint Mary tells Saint Basil to take two pillars from a pagan temple.,,"<p>Saint Basil said, “Again, as before, Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin Mary, the Birth-giver of God, appeared to me as I slept. She said to me, ‘Why are you idle instead of seeking pillars to put above the board?’ I replied to her, ‘O my Lady, you know that I have gone everywhere looking for two pillars which are the size of the wall of the sanctuary but I have not found them.’ And she said to me, ‘If you want to erect pillars, behold the temple in the city. You will find two pillars standing by the idolatrous temple which they erected in the days of the pharaohs. Upon them are the names of demons. People tried to seize them but they were unable to move them. However, by the command of my beloved son, they will come.’ Having said this, Our Lady hid herself from me.</p>

<p>“Awaking from the vision, I thought to myself, ‘How shall I take those great pillars?’ And as I thought this in my heart, a voice came to me, saying, ‘O Basil! Basil! Why are you troubled in your heart over the pillars? The Lord, He Who took Habakkuk the prophet and placed him to the land of Babylon with food in his hands and he made him descend into the den with Daniel, He will move those pillars from their place.’</p>

<p>“When the sun arose, I had the people assemble and told them what I saw. Ira, the archpriest, responded to me, saying, ‘O my father, we will do this task. I believe in the Lord, that He will make right our hearts with which we search. Take some parchment and inscribe upon it the image of the Holy Cross, then the Name of Our Lord Jesus Christ and the name of the Virgin Mary and the names of the seven archangels. Take a rod and hang upon it the Cross and we will go to the idolatrous temple. I know that Our Lord Jesus Christ will accomplish for us what we ask of Him.’</p>

<p>“I did as he said, taking a rod and placing it upon the pillars and they rolled before us until they arrived near the city. Then, we came upon sorcerers (whom we mentioned earlier) and, performing works of sorcery, they seized the pillars in the middle of the city.

She said to me, ‘O Basil, why are you troubled in your heart over the pillars? Or have you not heard the words of David, “The words of the unjust have overcome us; And You O Lord will forgive us our sins.” And now behold! My son Jesus Christ will command the pillars to stand in their places in front of the wall of the sanctuary. As for the sorcerers, behold, they shall be able to see. The board on which my icon is painted with the two virgins is strong and fastened upon the pillar before the heron as before and the board will not move. Then it will be like His previous act of creation, since it will be built by the command of the Lord.</p>

<p>“‘And behold, I shall make a spring of water open beneath the pillar, and all who wash in it will be healed from every illness. Those people who practiced sorcery and were blinded as well as woman who was was seized by leprosy, when they went into the water and washed themselves in it, I made an abyss that stretched open its mouth and consumed them forever.</p>

<p>“‘And you, Basil, give gifts for the sake of the beautiful church and consecrate it on the 21st of Sane, for it was on that day that my beloved son commanded His apostles to build a church for me.’ And when she said this, Our Lady and the Mother of Our Lord hid herself from me.</p>

<p>“Awaking, I immediately went to the church and saw the two pillars standing there and the board of the icon was fastened to them. I also found that a spring of water had opened by the right wall of the sanctuary. Once morning came, the people gathered in the place where the pillars had been. When they did not find them there, they went to the church and saw the pllars standing in their positions with the board of the icon fixed upon them. They cried out with one voice, saying, ‘O Lord, have mercy on us, Christ! Great is Your miracle, O Lord!’ And all those gathered immersed themselves in the water and were healed of all their illnesses. But those who practiced sorcery became blind and were forced to feel around before the people and likewise a woman with leprosy, when they went and tried to wash themselves in the water, immediately an abyss devoured them. Their number was sixteen souls.</p>

While he went down the road, he saw the ground shaking. He also saw cows grazing, looking towards the sky, and he also saw a great stream nearby; when he went nearer in order to drink, he saw a flock of sheep looking towards the sky and standing still. Then Joseph raised his eyes to the hills of Bethlehem and saw a woman approaching, and when she had approached closer, Joseph greeted her. And she said to him: “Where are you going? What are you looking for?” Joseph responded: “I seek a midwife.” And the woman said: “Who is that woman who rests in the stable?” “Mary,” said Joseph, “who conceived by the Holy Spirit.” The woman said to him: “Do you speak the truth?” “Come to her,” said Joseph, and they both went together and entered the stable. And behold, a crown of bright aether enwrapped Mary, and a great light was emanating from the stable, and they beheld the whole region illuminated, and they saw an infant placed in a manger. Then suddenly, that woman shouted in a great voice, saying: “My soul glorifies the Lord on this day, since I saw a new light and great glory.” And heavenly soldiers arose in that same moment and descended to the place in which he was, he who on that day was born the God of Israel, who will save the people from their sins. And when that woman left the stable, look, another woman came, whose name was Salome, sent by the Lord to Mary, and the woman said to her: “Salome, come and see the astonishing thing, which has never happened from the creation of the world nor will it ever happen in the age of ages. For the virgin Mary has given birth and remains a virgin after the birth.” Salome responded, saying, “As the Lord lives, I will not believe this speech unless I see it with my own eyes.” And then they both went together and entered the stable. Then Salome, approaching close to Mary, extended her hands so that she could see, but a burning flame went from Mary’s body and Salome’s hands were burnt. Then with a great uproar she shouted and said: “Woe to me! Woe to me on account of my great sin and my defective faith.” And she prostrated herself on the ground and said: “You Lord and God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, do not leave me in dishonor and disgrace among the sons of Israel, but see my humility: heal me from my affliction, for all who call your name are freed from their troubles.” And suddenly the angel of the Lord appeared to Salome, saying to her: “The Lord has heard your prayer and entreatment; take the infant and carry him with your hands burnt by fire, and you will find great joy.” And thus Salome prostrated herself on the ground, and after she carried the infant with her hands, which had been burnt by fire, suddenly she was healed. Then she exclaimed: “Truly, this is the King of Israel.” And when she left the stable with great joy, behold, a voice came from heaven, saying to her: “Salome, watch yourself, and tell no one what you saw, until the boy goes to Jerusalem.” [Translation as of 05/21/22]</p>",,"Miracle of Mary: Salome's hands are burned when she tries to verify St Mary's virginity, but they are healed when she takes the Christ Child into her arms.",How the Salome the midwife glorified the birth of the Virgin Mary.,"Bethlehem; Burnings; Mountains; Punishments; Salome, servant of the Holy Family; Virgins",,15,65,1,LIT5230MiracleSalome,,,CAe 5230,"Chaine, Apocrypha, p. 14:1.",,,260,,36,36,3,"EMML (HMML) 3872, Ethio-SPaRe (UH) MKL-002, Ethio-SPaRe (UH) MKMG-006",ዘከመ፡ ውዕየ፡ እዴሃ፡ ለሰሎሜ፡ በገሲሰ፡ ሥጋሃ፡ ለማርያም፡ ወዘከመ፡ ሕይወ፡ በጸዊረ፡ ወልዳ። ጸሎታ፡…. ወእምዝ፡ አንሥአ፡ አዕይንቲሁ፡ ዮሴፍ፡ መንገለ፡ አድባር፡ ዘቤተ፡ ልሔም፡ ወናሁ፡ ርእየ፡ ብእሲተ፡ እንዘ፡ ትመጽእ,,,,በበዓለ፡ ልደት (Ethio-SPaRe QDQ-003),TRUE,,,,"Mary, Life: Pregnancy with Christ",,,No,Life of Mary,Rowan Williams,Published translation,,,,260,,,,,,"Salome's hands are burned when she tries to verify Saint Mary's virginity, but they are healed when she takes the Christ Child into her arms.",Yes,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,No,Yes,Yes,No,262,,TRUE,Elliot Galvis,Translation of a translation,,,1450,1500,,,"Joseph led Mary into a stable, then left to go find a midwife.

<p>        Before him, they had imprisoned abbâ Jean, the hegumen of the desert of Scetis.</p>
<p>        All two encountered each other there, they comforted each other. The master of abbâ Samuel was full of force and he was firm of heart.</p>
<p>        Next, he attached the foot of Samuel with the foot of a servant, under the counsel of Satan, and he sent them into the desert to graze the camels.</p>
<p>        His master thought that the saint abbâ Samuel would fall with her in sin and obey him in all that he told him, as for what the devil had advised him.</p>
<p>        Despite all that, abbâ Samuel was full of force, his heart was firm and he stayed in that way until his master fell ill and was close to death. The saint abbâ Samuel prayed upon him and cured him of his malady, because Our Lady Mary visited him continually.</p>
<p>        His reputation was known in all the country. One would bring him all those who were ill; he would pray upon them, anoint them with oil and they would be cured of their malady.</p>
<p>        When his master saw that, he was strongly amazed; he prostrated himself before him and said to him, “Pardon me all my sin that I have done against you.”</p>
<p>        He took him in great affection and interrogated him, saying, “Tell me that wich you want, I will do it for you.”</p>
<p>        The saint abbâ Samuel said to him, “I want to return to my country.”</p>
<p>        Immediately his master prepared for him numerous goods as presents, he took leave of him and sent with him servants until Samuel had reached his monastery.</p>
<p>        His spiritual children assembled around him, and increased until they were ten thousand.</p>
<p>        Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary mother of God, appeared to him and said to him, “This place will be my abode forever.”</p>
<p>        From that day, the infidels no longer came to the monastery of abbâ Samuel.</p>

276,"The fate of the monk, Giyorgis, who followed the heretical teachings of Za-Mika'el.",Africa Ethiopia confirmed,"<p>Listen, my fathers and brothers, holy and chosen, who are in the right faith and in the teaching of the faith of the pure apostles, to the telling of a miracle of Our Lady Mary that she showed concerning those who neglect Mount Zion and her? miracles.</p>
<p>There was a man, a monk by the name of George, among the sons of the rebels of the faith.</p>
<p>Za-Mikâêl, who divided the Church, had changed the teaching of the apostles and introduced another teaching, according to what Satan had made sprout in his heart.</p>
<p>When the king knew this, he held a reunion with three bishops: Abbâ Michael, Abbâ Gabriel, and Abbâ John.</p>
<p>The heretics were vanquished by the word of Scripture and excommunicated by the bishops because of Mount Zion and also because of the Sabbath.</p>
<p>As they had not abandoned their wrongdoing and their teaching, the king jailed George in the palace; he would declare him innocent if he [George] turned away from his heresy.</p>
<p>But George did not abandon his wrongdoing, saying from his mouth (only), “I turn away, have pity on me!”</p>
<p>And after this, he began (to speak?).</p>
<p>But, in his heart, he did not turn away.</p>
<p>When God who plombs hearts saw this, He kept him in prison for many days.</p>
<p>Then a terrible ache seized George, so much so that his whole body rotted.</p>
<p>As for the place where he stayed, it reeked from far away.</p>
<p>“When the moment of his death approached, he sent to me, me John the poor and the sinner, his guardian named Binaberây, making him say, ‘Come to me for God, for I have something to confess before dying and before my soul departs.’</p>
<p>“When I arrived beside him, I found him moaning with sorrow and anguish of death.</p>
<p>“I could not stand before the force of his stench.</p>
<p>“He was like a drunk man.</p>
<p>“Lying down, he grasped me with his hand.</p>
<p>“He said to me, ‘Make me do penance, father, for my (spiritual) father Za-Mikâêl is lost by the badness of his teaching.</p>
<p>“‘And he lost my soul.’</p>
<p>“I said to him, ‘What happened to him? What did you see?’</p>
<p>“He said to me, ‘So there came to me beings with dark faces, who frighten men; they took me. I saw cities, luminous like the sun. One city shone among them. Beside it was an elevated and very luminous throne. Upon this was sitting a man clothed in light, he was radiant like the sun.</p>
<p>“‘I said to those who were taking me, What are these cities of light? And this city that shines more than all? And this elevated throne? And the man who is sitting on it?’</p>
<p>“‘They told me: The cities that you see are the cities of the just. This city which shines more than all is the Mount Zion that you renounced. That against which your master Za-Mikâêl spread lies. As for the elevated throne and the man who sits upon it, that is he whose teaching you refused.</p>
<p>“‘They grew irritated with me, with vehemence and fury. I was frightened by their great shouts, I turned from side to side and I saw my master Za-Mikâêl dressed in darkness. The dark figures who had iron chains surrounded me. As for Abbâ Nob standing outside, beside the city, his clothing shone strongly while he wept.</p>
<p>“‘I said to those who were irritated against me Is this not Za-Mikâêl, the master of the lie that made me arrive at this mountain of tribulation? And Abbâ Nob, why did this affliction reach him: his life was good? And he walked in the way of the monastic life!</p>
<p>“‘They said to me: (He was doing so) by scorning in his heart the miracles of Our Lady, the holy twice-virgin Mary, Mother of God. Za-Mikâêl your master renounced Mount Zion. Now tell your faults: maybe you will be relieved of your punishment. Misfortune to those who walk according to your teaching, those who are like you!’</p>
<p>“When he had addressed these many words to me, he was like a drunk man. He lost sense. His eyes were changed. He shook his tongue. I had great fear and said, ‘Now he will bite me!’ I said (again), ‘It would have been better for him had the penance eût lieu de son vivant.  But we forget the day of our death. Satan offers us sweetnesses. And we arrive in this perdition/distress. But God is merciful.’</p>
<p>“He said to me, ‘Report this story to the king for me so that he might intercede with God and so that God might pardon my sin; I heard his teaching and I reviled it.’</p>
<p>He said to me (again), ‘If I were alive, I will speak (myself).’ </p>
<p>“He begged me greatly. Because of the force of his stench, I could not stay longer. I left quickly. When I left, he cried, his tongue stammering. He said to me, ‘Don’t abandon me, father, but return to me!’</p>
<p>“I said, ‘I will come to you afterward.’</p>
<p>“So I went into my dwelling. In the evening, He sent me again one of his guardians, by the name of Zarou, making him say, ‘Come to me, receive my confession and absolve me, do not abandon me!’</p>
<p>“But I did not worry myself to go there. That night, he died, saying many words. We did not understand his words because of the stammering of his tongue.</p>
<p>“(His guardians) said, ‘He pushed great moans.’</p>
<p>“The morning came, I went and found his body stretched out on the earth, naked, and I buried it.</p>
<p>“All this is what happened, I added nothing; simply, I made cuts in what he said.</p>
<p>“My witnesses are the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit in the hands of whom are mercy and punishment.</p>
<p>“If I had come again to him, at the moment when he had hurried to me, he would have said more things than this.</p>
<p>“Glory to God the Father, the Son Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit, trins? By the person and by the hypostasis!”</p>

<p>So Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, Mother of God, came in the middle of them, a great glory surrounding her.</p>
<p>“She made them drink a sweet drink in a golden goblet.</p>
<p>“Me, when I saw this, I burned with the desire  to drink with them.</p>
<p>“The angel that stood with her said to me, ‘You, do not go there; you do not deserve it, for you are lazy.’”</p>
<p>Now see, Christians, the greatness of carrying out [l’exécution] the chant in the church, how it is loved by God and by Our Lady Mary, Mother of God.</p>
<p>Happy is he who sings at the church and who praises in the middle of the congregation, according to what the prophet David said: “In the middle of the congregation, I will praise you, Lord.” </p>
<p>As for those who praise god with cries, they make all the parts of their body serve this purpose [y font servir].</p>
<p>When the priest sings with great cries, he whose throat swells, as well as all his fibres and all of his body - especially his heart - , his praise [glorification] is united with the praise of the 24 priests of the sky. </p>
<p>It is they also, the seraphim, who praise the Most High by crying and exclaiming until the sound of their praise fills the palace of heaven.</p>
<p>According to what the prophet Isaiah said, “I saw God the Most High, here he was seated  upon a throne and his glory filled (the House).</p>
<p>The seraphim were standing around Him, each had six wings; with two wings they covered their feet, with two wings they covered their face, with two wings they flew; they cried, one after another.</p>
<p>“They were saying, ‘Holy, holy, holy is the God of armies , the holiness of his glory completely fills heaven and earth!’ Then the threshold rose at the voice of those who cried and smoke filled the House.” </p>
<p>In particular, he who chants and prays in his cell and his abode by whispering without rest, and who chants in the church, his reward [rétribution] will be with those who serve [font le service]. As for the priests, while they make resound the sound of their song, this song is heard ten bow-lengths away  and their voice fills the mountains.</p>
<p>Thanks to this, God gives them as a prize for their praise what the eye did not see nor the ear hear, by the prayer and intercession of Our Lady Mary, Mother of God.[Translation as of 05/21/22]</p>

279,Zärˀa Yaˁəqob miracles: The inhabitants of Damot who would not observe the feast days of Saint Mary are punished by a storm that brings down a mighty tree.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed,"<p>How Our Lady made a komâ tree fall in the land of Dâmot</p>
<p>We have (never) heard nor seen such a miracle, our fathers did not speak of it to us and it was not done in the whole of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>Our Lady made a great tree fall when they violated her feast.</p>
<p>There was a great earthquake and much lightning fell in the summer days and not during the winter, as was customary.</p>
<p>Such a miracle as that which Our Lady did in the land of Dâmot had never been done before in the land of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>It was the 24th of the month of genbot during the feast of Our Lady Mary, in the land of Dâmot. Half the people of Enselâl observed the feast of Our Lady, the other half violated it.</p>
<p>Then, there was a great earthquake.</p>
<p>Much lightning fell.</p>
<p>There was darkness and wind.</p>
<p>During this earthquake, a great komâ tree fell in the land of Enselâl. </p>
<p>When the people of the city saw that this komâ tree had been torn from its roots and destroyed, they said, “Because of what did this occur?”</p>
<p>Some said, “Is it not the feast of Our Lady Mary: people of the country violated the day of her feast?”</p>
<p>All this occurred because the feast of Our Lady Mary had been violated on that day.</p>
<p>For in truth this day is (that of) the great feast of Our Lady, the holy twice-virgin Mary, Mother of God.</p>
<p>It is the 24th of the month of genbot, (day) during which Our Lady entered the land of Egypt carrying her small infant, as Isaiah the prophet said: See, God rides on a luminous cloud and comes to Egypt. </p>
<p>As for the komâ tree, it stayed fallen with the other trees that had fallen with it, for 153 days, until the 21st of teqemt.</p>
<p>While the people of the country cut its great branches, there was a man by the name of Zênâ Hawâryât.</p>
<p>He took an axe on the 21st of the month of teqemt, during the feast of Our Lady Mary the Virgin, and went to cut the komâ tree.</p>
<p>A man by the name of Zara Krestos said to Zênâ Hawâryât: “I recommend, in the name of Mary the twice-virgin, that you not cut this tree. For, on the 24th of the month of genbot, when you violated the feast of Our Lady Mary the twice-virgin, the earth quaked, there were flashes, crashes, and thunder in the sky, rain and hail fell. This komâ tree was torn from its roots and fell with all the trees that had fallen around it. As for us, we were thus saved from accuracy. Is today not the feast of Our Lady, the holy twice-virgin Mary, Mother of God? It is the 21st of the month of teqemt. So why do you violate the feast of the mother of the Savior of the world?”</p>
<p>The other dismissed him and began to cut the tree again.</p>
<p>The man by the name of Zara Krestos begged him again in the name of Our Lady Mary twice-virgin.</p>
<p>He said, “I recommend, by the virginity of the Pure, that you not cut this tree.”</p>
<p>This Zênâ Hawâryât, of thick heart, strongly impious, dismissed him.</p>
<p>He raised the axe and began to cut the tree.</p>
<p>Zara Krestos, accomplished in the faith and love of Our Lady Mary twice-virgin, began to rogue with he who had violated the feast of Our Lady Mary twice-virgin.</p>
<p>He said, “Man, why do you not listen to my word? When I begged you again in the name of Our Lady Mary twice-virgin, you scorned what I had begged you in the name of the mother of the Creator of heaven and earth, Our Lady Mary twice-virgin. Three times, you scorned (the warning) when I begged you in the name of the Mother of God, Our Lady Mary twice-virgin. You make me wonder at the patience of God, who did not swallow you in the depths of the earth, for you scorned the name of His mother twice-virgin.”</p>
<p>While Zara Krestos thus rebuked Zênâ Hawâryât who had violated the day of the feast of Our Lady, the holy twice-virgin Mary Mother of God, the axe that chopped (the wood) was in the hands of this man.</p>
<p>All the people of the city, men and women, were there. Some wanted to take the wood that Zênâ Hawâryât had cut from the trunk.</p>
<p>Some said to him, “You have done three great sins. One, for having scorned (the warning) when Zara Krestos begged you in the name of Our Lady Mary. Two, for having rejected (the warning) when he begged you in the name of Our Lady. Three, for having violated the day of the feast of Our Lady.” </p>
<p>And they began to rebuke the madman.</p>
<p>Then, the komâ tree picked itself up and rose.</p>
<p>The trees that had fallen with it picked themselves up at the same time and rose.</p>
<p>They budded and produced leaves.</p>
<p>But the komâ tree did not produce leaves; on the contrary, it alone stayed dry/barren.</p>
<p>Its height was 19 cubits and its thickness seven cubits.</p>
<p>It was completely similar to a pillar, for, by the greatness of the miracle of Our Lady Mary twice-virgin, it stood like before.</p>
<p>Before Our Lady, the holy twice-virgin Mary, Mother of God, had made it fall to show her miracle.</p>
<p>Then she had picked it up and raised it.</p>
<p>Where has this (ever) been recounted?</p>
<p>When did we hear that trees that had fallen picked themselves up and rose?</p>
<p>God made this miracle of Our Lady so that the power of His mother, of Our Lady, the holy twice-virgin Mary, might appear, raising up a tree that had died.</p>
<p>As for this Zênâ Hawâryât who had violated the day of her feast and who had scorned (the warning) when Zara Krestos had begged him in the name of Our Lady Mary twice-virgin, (so as for him), a great leper seized him and his hands and his feet became disabled.</p>
<p>Those who saw this astonishing thing gave thanks to God Most High.</p>
<p>The priests, monks, deacons, and all the people of Dâmot praised Our Lady, the holy twice-virgin Mary.</p>
<p>Again about the way Our Lady raised the komâ tree in the land of Dâmot</p>
<p>As we said previously, five months after (the day) that is the 24th of the month of genbot, after Our Lady had made the komâ tree fall in the land of Dâmot, she picked it up and raised it like (it had been) before, on the 21st of the month of teqemt.</p>
<p>Then, when the people of the city heard that the komâ tree was standing by the power of Our Lady, they all assembled beside it.</p>
<p>When they saw this great and astonishing miracle, such as had never been done before this, they said among themselves, “Come, let us hurry to the king Zara Yâqob (to inform him) of this great miracle. Our king Zara Yâqob, who is called Constantin, is at Dabra Berhân since [since as time, not causal] there was built there a church by the grace of God. So it is that Our Lady, the holy twice-virgin Mary, Mother of God, made this great and astonishing miracle.”</p>
<p>They sent him messengers who told him all that had happened. He felt great joy.</p>
<p>So he sent messengers so that he might see this extraordinary thing, as well as the intendants of the king’s house with an altar to Our Lady Mary twice-virgin, with consecrated vases, with a parasol and with a tabernacle.</p>
<p>The number sent was around 296.</p>
<p>The king gave his orders to those sent, saying, “If this story is truthful, build a church there.”</p>
<p>Having arrived in the land of Dâmot, those sent saw the tree that Our Lady, the holy twice-virgin Mary, Mother of God, had picked up after it had fallen, as well as the trees that had budded and produced trees after they had fallen with the komâ tree.</p>
<p>This one had not produced leaves. It alone stayed dry/barren and was standing like a pillar. </p>
<p>When those sent saw this great miracle, they wondered and were astonished.</p>
<p>They rejoiced and gave thanks to God. They praised Our Lady Mary, twice-virgin.</p>
<p>They bowed before her, having placed her icon upon the komâ tree that picked itself up and stood after having fallen.</p>
<p>They went around the icon with incense and songs, just as the king had ordered.</p>
<p>They built a church in the name of Our Lady, the holy twice-virgin Mary, Mother of God. </p>
<p>They made two interiors.</p>
<p>The tree was in the middle of the interior.</p>
<p>They made also tents on the outside, toward the east</p>
<p>The inauguration of the church took place on the day of the feast of Candlemas, which is the end (of the feasts about) the birth of Our Lord Jesus Christ, during which Simeon the priest received Him. </p>
<p>They added the altar with acclamations and praises, with steaming of incense and hymns.</p>
<p>The assembly was numerous. The number of priests was about 70. The people, men adn women, were very numerous. </p>
<p>They celebrated the feast by sacrificing bulls and lambs.</p>
<p>During the construction of this church, there were miracles and wonders.</p>
<p>Like many soldiers, innumerable, were those assembled; they finished without trouble, those who carried the trees and those who dug the earth.</p>
<p>Of those also who carried the thatch and the other (materials) necessary for the church, none objected.</p>
<p>All were joyous like he who drinks wine.</p>
<p>Their strength did not fade.</p>
<p>Their hands and feet were not injured by (the tools of) iron.</p>
<p>See, people of Christians, the greatness, the glory and the power of the miracle of Our Lady mary twice-virgin:</p>
<p>How a great leper seized the man who had scorned (the warning) when they had begged hi in the name of Our Lady Mary twice-virgin, when he violated her feast;</p>
<p>How Our Lady picked up and raised the great tree that had fallen;</p>

280,Zärˀa Yaˁəqob miracles: The judgment of the court of Zärˀa Yaˁəqob against the Stephanites (Ǝsṭifanites/Estifanites),Africa Ethiopia confirmed,"<p>More numerous is the series of tales referring to the negus Zärˀa Yaˁəqob (who reigned from 1434 to 1468). Elsewhere I have already published three of these stories (G n. 93 CR 52, 58; G. N. 94 CR 52, 59; G n. 95) concerning the war of Zärˀa Yaˁəqob against Sultan Badlrry ibn Sa'd ad-din. The volume published in Addis Ababa contains the following two stories of considerable historical interest as they refer to the struggle of the negus Zärˀa Yaˁəqob against the heresy of the Stefanites and another heresy -- that of the Mikl'E'elìti which we will determine below. Here too, if I am not mistaken, is the literary interest for the liveliness of the story joins the historical interest. It was written under the impulse of the emotion that the fierce struggle - one of the decisive moments of Ethiopian Christianity – which had to have provoked the contemporaries:  </p>
<p>(p.152) 24th Miracle. How convenient it is to venerate the Cross and our Lady. A miracle of Our Lady the Saint doubly the Virgin Mary and Mother of God – may her prayer and benediction be with us during centuries and centuries – amen. This is a miracle of the Cross of Her Son, Our Lord Jesus Christ, which He made for His Mother, Our Lady Maria the Saint doubly the Virgin and for His Holy Cross.  </p>
<p>There was a great country in the Christian Lands. And its Kings, the metropolitans, and all the many Christians who lived there loved Our Lady the Saint doubly the Virgin Mary and Mother of God, and they respected the holidays. And they venerated her and prostrated themselves to her. They then respected her feast of the Cross of Her Son and venerated it by prostrating themselves to it (the cross). And they adored it and carried it with faith.  </p>
<p>In that country, a black snake rose, similar to the false messiah and Christian in name. The man was a priest and monk. His behaviour was that of a true Jew, who was the son of the devil in his works. And this rebel and Jew said: ‘I am not venerating Mary. Nor will I come to the Cross of Her Son.’ And he taught many of his cowardly doctrine, which is viler than the carcasses of dogs. (p. 154) This black snake was expelled by the Christians. And our Lord Jesus Christ destroyed him there -- where he had been exiled -- by the intercession of Our Lady, doubly the Virgin and, by the might of His venerable Cross which is strength for Christians. And those followers of this black snake and son of Satan, who remained after him, said: ‘we do not prostrate ourselves to the Virgin Mary, nor do we prostrate ourselves to the Cross of His Son there.’ And many believed in their doctrine, a pernicious doctrine. </p>
<p>When the King and all the people of the country heard [this], they grieved greatly and pleaded with huge anguish to the Lord saying, ‘Show us, O Lord, the might of these Jewish rebels!’ And our King Zärˀa Yaˁəqob gathered those rebels. Then he brought together the Christian people who venerate with prostrations Our Lady Mary doubly the Virgin, and those who prostrate themselves to the Cross of His Son who is an aid to the Christians. (p155) The King and the Christian people said to those rebels ‘why don’t you prostrate yourself to Our Lady the Saint doubly Virgin Mary Mother of God nor to the Cross of Her Son, anointed with divine blood?’ And those Jewish rebels said, ‘we don’t prostrate ourselves to Mary doubly the Virgin, and nor at the Cross of her Son.’ And the Christian People asked them: ‘Did you find it in the Books (Saints) or is it by speculation of your mind that you say not to prostrate yourselves to our Lady doubly the holy Virgin Mary Mother of God or to the Cross of Her Son?’ And those rebels replied: ‘[we do this] according to what our teacher taught us.’ And the congregation of Christians sentenced them to death, saying ‘Death is convenient to those who say, with his mouth, he is a Christian -- and among them there are priests and deacons by name -- while his action is to act as a Jew, who pains the heart. (p156). Death is the sentence to those most damned.  </p>
<p>And the King ordered that their nose and tongue be cut off. And so, they cut them off for others to fear. But for this, these rebels were unable to perform their evils. Then the Christian people gathered and said: ‘why did you leave these Jewish rebels by only cutting off their noses and tongues? Now it is fitting that they are stoned with rocks because they say they do not prostrate themselves to Our Lady Mary doubly Virgin or to the Cross of Her Son.’ There were, at that time, in Ethiopia some envoys of the Patriarch of Alexandria named Abba Mattewos. There were three envoys: one hegumen (qomos), whose position was higher than the rank of a (simple) priest, an elected and elderly monk, lover of fasting and prayers, and connoisseur of the Books (Saints) of the Old and New (Testament). (p.157) The second (envoy) was a deacon, elderly and elected monk, connoisseur of the Books (Saints). And the third was also a deacon. And they had come on behalf of the Patriarch and the Sultan of Cairo to announce to the Negus of Ethiopia, Zare’a Ya’qob, good and joyful news: that the Sultan of Cairo had allowed the Christians of Egypt to rebuild the already ruined Christian churches and restore the old ones. And they had brought with them some gifts from the Patriarch to the Negus: three tabots and a golden effigy of our Lady Mary, which represented her when she was with her Son, the a Child at Mount Quesquam; and a golden effigy of the Crucifixion of Our Lord and a golden effigy of St. Michael the Archangel; and plenty of holy oil. The King ordered these envoys of the Patriarch to judge those who had refused to prostrate themselves to Our Lady and to the Cross of Her Son.  </p>
<p>(p158) The Patriarch’s envoys interrogated those rebels where they were gathered with the clergyman, the singers, the nebura and all the hosts, saying to them: “Why don’t you prostrate yourselves to our Lady doubly Virgin Mary? Don’t you know that Our Lady, doubly Virgin Mary, is the Mother of God? And why don’t you prostrate yourselves to the Cross of His Son? Don’t you know that Jesus Christ was crucified on it and that our life was for the Cross?” And those rebels replied: “We don’t prostrate ourselves to Mary or to the Cross of Her Son!” And (the Patriarch’s envoys) condemned those rebels to be stoned. And also, the Europeans and those of Constantinople and Syria – as they were all present at that meeting – judged that the infidels were to be stoned. (p159) And all those at the Christian meeting said that it was right that they should be stoned. And, concluded thus the judgement: the King ordered those rebels to be stoned. And so, the Christians organised an assembly and stoned them (the infidels) on the 2nd Friday of the Month of Yakkatit.  </p>
<p>38 days after the stoning of those rebels, allies of the Jews, the Lord made a great miracle for His Mother Our Lady Mary doubly Virgin and for His venerable Cross, on the tenth [day] of the month of Maggābit, Monday, the feast of the Cross of Christ. He came out and saw a great light in the King’s enclosure and even far around the King’s enclosure. And this light appeared in the Churches on their vestments and internal and external curtains, curtains of silk and curtains of… (p160) Then it appeared on men’s tents, on their veils, on the clothes that they wore and the belts that encircled them and, on all the (sacred) furnishings that light appeared. There was a great joy in the court of the King and that light remained visible for several days. And the sight of that light looked like a flame of fire, but it did not burn; and when someone approached, it brightened his face and the heart rejoiced at the sight of his light.  </p>
<p>There was a monk, a servant of the lord and beloved of the King. Before the light appeared, he had asked the King to allow him to go to his country. The King allowed him, and he went. And, after he had gone five stages [in his journey], the King grieved because his favourite monk would not have seen that light. So, he [the King] hastily sent some messengers on horseback to bring him back so he [the monk] could see that light. When they brought him back, he completed the five-stage journey in two days. (p161) This was for the help of God and for the faith of that King, worshiper of the Holy Trinity and learn-ed of the mystery of the Trinity. And that monk said: ‘when the King commanded that seven great messengers were to receive me, a poor monk, I was with five of my brother monks and the seven messengers were with their servants. When we went by this route  all together, there being no moonlight,  but being dark that night, the clouds had filled the face of the sky so that neither sun nor star could be seen, if not hardly once in a while; suddenly we saw a great light erupt in front of us. We all said, since there was no light and clouds filled the sky: “what is this light that guides us?’ Nor did we understand where that light came from. And when we could not pass a deep torrent, and before that torrent there were great mountains. I, a sinner and poor monk, my fellow monks, and the seven envoys of the King with their servants saw (p.162) -- all of us together, a great column of fire whose summit reached the heavens, and in whose light, there were no impurities of smoke. Indeed, it was as clear as sunlight. When we saw this great miracle together, we said ‘what is this fire whose height reaches the sky? Has the great house of the King burned down?’ Therefore I, the poor monk, was astonished. And I said, ‘My Lord called me to joy to see the light come down in his court! And now instead it pains me because a great fire came out of his court.’ I said this because it seemed to me that it was an earthly fire; [but] God is a witness to me in this matter: as I saw that great column of fire, I and my fellow monks and the messengers of the King and those who were with them. And the light guided us. And when we arrived at the city of that King, that column of light disappeared.  </p>
<p>And that King, who had a fondness for that monk, (p. 163), before sending the messengers to bring back that monk, had pleaded with our Lady Mary, standing before her effigy and saying ‘O my Lady Mary, bring that beloved monk of mine [to me], without any harm to him during the route; because, I ordered them to take him at night and bring him to me in times of darkness, but the way is bad and rough. Even in the daytime if you go that way, you go with difficulty. And that which hastened me to order them to bring him at night is my desire to tell him about this miracle.’ And our Lady Mary doubly the Virgin accepted the plea of that King and made the great column of fire appear in his court until the light reached where that monk was with his five brothers, the great messengers of the King, and with them their servants. And, after guiding them to the light of that pillar of fire, they arrived at his court.  </p>
<p>The King asked them: ‘Is this story true?’ They replied: ‘yes! It is true, because God (p164) is testimony to how we, the five monks, saw the pillar of fire together; and we were guided by its light until we came to your court.’ And also, the seven messengers with the others who followed us said: ‘We too saw that pillar of fire as the monks saw it and we were guided by its light together with the monks until we came to your court, o our Lord. And God is a testament to this: that we do not say what we have seen and what we did not see.’ The King rejoiced, having heard that this great miracle was done by Our Lord Jesus Christ, with the appearance of the column of fire for His Mother Mary, doubly the virgin, and for the veneration of His Cross. And therefore, he praised the Lord with His Mother the Saint doubly the Virgin Mary. He then ordered the King to be shown to that monk who returned from the journey with his monk brothers, the light descended in honour of Our lady Mary doubly virgin and in honour of the Cross of Her Son. (p165) And those to whom the King had given the order led those monks and brought them into Church on Thursday night at the time of the rooster awakening, the 1st of the maggabit, on the fifth day since the light had descended. Before the monks had put their clothes away that light moved. And the light appeared from that garment like a flame of fire no did that light burn. When the monks saw it, they marvelled and went wild with great joy and prostrated themselves on the ground and praised the Son of God who had made the light appear like a blaze of fire that flames in honour of His Mother Mary, doubly the virgin and in honour of His Cross and His pure Blood. Whose prayer and blessing together with mercy of His beloved Son be with us forever and ever! – Amen”[Translation as of 05/21/22]</p>

283,A Christian community is attacked by a neighboring Muslim community.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed,"How the Faithful Fought Back the Infidel ~ There was, in a Christian country, a dabra with a high elevation and whose top was proportionally wide. On top of it there was a church built in the name of God the Father, the creator of all creatures; and in the name of his only Son, who is glorified by the diligent, who put on the flesh of Our Lady Mary daughter of David and Solomon; and in the name of the Holy Spirit, Paraclete, who made the Prophets speak and whom the Apostles drank in the Hall of Zion. The three tabots, in their [respective] names, were there decorated with gold, silver and pearls and placed on silver altars not shaking at all, but very firm. ~ Now there lived a distance from there, on the right, left and eastern sides of that church, a multitude of infidels [=Moslems] who had wished it evil ever since it was built through many years. They gnashed [their] teeth upon it whenever they saw it with [their] eye[s]. They wanted to burn it and destroy it with iron. The priests and the deacons and all the Christians were grieved because of these infidels. The tongue of a mortal cannot count how many Christians fell by the spear while fighting in its defense. ~ Once a priest was appointed by the king to rule many countries and to protect that church. When those filthy infidels heard that a priest had been appointed, they rejoiced and broke forth into singing [instigated] by Satan saying, ""Who shall fight us now that a priest is appointed?"" They thought that God is delighted in the strength of the horse and that the Lord of the mighty will be pleased with the legs of a man. But God, the Lord of the mighty, makes the mighty fall at the hands of the weak. He can make the jubilant sorrowful and the sorrowful jubilant; whatever he pleased that did he in heaven and in earth, on seas and in the depth of seas. 16 Let us pray God, therefore, that he might protect us and guide us with his help and that we might not boast by the power of kings and rulers and by many thousands of soldiers, but keep us firm in the Orthodox faith forever. Amen. ~The Mari of the Moslems, moreover, heard from those who came from the church, from those who corrupted the religion of the Son and believed in the religion of Mohammed. They said to him, ""Come, so that we might guide you and bring you to the däbr which you wanted, where there is gold, silver and precious clothes which are impossible to count and recount."" They also said to him, ""Some of the Christians sent us [here] saying: 'Tell him to come quickly'; you should know whether they are two or three. What we told you is as they told us."" ""Would you really bring me there?"" he asked them. ""If we do not bring you there,"" they said to him, ""pierce us with your spear and take us, binding us in chains and driving us before you. If we bring you there you may decorate us. If we do not bring you there cut off our heads."" ~ The Mari of the Moslems sent one of his confidants, whom he loved dearly, with many horses which they ride, [which were] equipped with many saddle[s] that have gold, many reins of gold, many golden trappings, many golden sticks and many spears of gold and many drums called nagarit. The number of the horses which were [so] dressed were, as the spies told us, three hundred. The number of bearing horses that were unsaddled was unknown because of their abundance. The infantry, too, was, like them, countless. They came to that däbr to us, by the power of Satan, led by Satan. They besieged the däbr on all sides on the holy day of Our Lady Mary Twice Virgin. Those who guided him to the däbr, who were infidels although Christians in name, said to him, ""As for us, we have brought you here; do quickly what you wanted to do."" The arrival of those Moslems was sudden; neither the priest- ruler nor the people nor anyone in the army was informed. The ruler and all of the army heard [of it only] after the army crossed the river that was between them. The priests and the monks held prayers. ~~ A priest saw [a vision] before they started the fight. He said: I saw a woman sitting without a chair near a church beneath the outer side of the thresh hold of the door facing to the West. The woman was clothed in a white dress. Her veil spread all over the face of the whole yard of the church. A green cloth came out of her cloth and the cloth which her baby Son put on. The garment had hair on it. There was a man in front of her; she said to him, ""Come, raise me up with your hand so that you may bring me into the church."" The man was afraid to raise her up and to come close to her. She said to him, ""Come, raise me up! Be not afraid, for I am light; I am not heavy."" She held him by his hand, and so the man raised her up. That great woman entered the Church with him guided by the Child, her Son. Honorable people who looked like Egyptians received the great woman with lamps. They rejoiced in her. They all surrounded her. The number of lamps was more than one thousand. I became happy when I saw this. Waking up in happiness I thanked God and praised Our Lady Mary. I knew that that woman was our Lady Mary saviour of the whole world. ~~ He told this vision which he had seen to two men who loved him. He had seen this dream living in another country, before hearing any news, good or bad. ~ Now let us go back to our earlier story of the war. That Infidel came to the däbr and camped at the bottom of the däbr. He then wanted to ascend it; the day was the 21st of the month of Mäggabit, the holy day of Our Lady Mary Twice Virgin. The priest-ruler was on the däbr with a few of the army. The Infidel strengthened himself to ascend the däbr. But the ruler fought back the Infidel with the few of the army and became four times as strong so that the Christian army conquered him and sent him away in shame by the power of the Holy Trinity and by the prayer of Our Lady Mary Twice Virgin, Mother of God. ~ While he was fleeing, he turned around and burned down a small church built in the name of Our Lady Mary Twice Virgin. The Infidel [then] said in arrogance, calling to the Christians who were fighting him, ""Why did she not save her house, she of whom you say, 'Our Lady Mary saves us'."" (But we say, ""bowing is proper to mentioning her name for salvation."") He ran away from them in fear, turning his face towards his country. The priest-ruler followed him with the army which was with him. on the däbr . He first sent the infantry that was stinging with bows. 22 The infantry caught up with the Infidel and his army, chasing him before the priest-ruler and the cavalry arrived. The priest- ruler arrived with [his] army and gave the order to cut off their heads and strip them of their possessions. Many officers were arrested; and they cut off the head of the Infidel. They took booty, by the power of the Trinity, the boxes with their camels- the boxes which the Infidel brought loaded on camels to put in the gold and the silver which he would take from the däbr of God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit! They took as captives all that were left from the fight. They also took many clothes and tunics of silk. All this happened by the prayer of Our Lady Mary, Twice Virgin, when she beseeched the Holy Trinity and prayed to [the Trinity] for the sake of us, we the sinners. Now, too, may her prayer and blessing be with us forever.

284,Zärˀa Yaˁəqob miracles: A renegade monk who had become a Jew is hunted down by the troops of the king.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed,"A miracle of our Lady Mary Twice Virgin, Mother of God, God (of) Sabaoth, Mother of Jesus Christ, King of Glory. [As] she conceived him in virginity of mind and in the virginity of body and bore him being virgin in mind and virgin in body (so) Our Lord her beloved Son showed her miracles and wonders by showing a great power unto a certain Jew who was, however, first a Christian. May her prayer be with Galasəyos. Amen. ~ There was a certain country, a country of Christians. Her kings were Christians living together with metropolitans and bishops. Many priests, deacons and monks lived in that country. Now, there arose a Jew from among the Christian clergy and learned the theology of the Jews. He then ·taught (it) to a small village and converted the people of that village. God smote that Christian who became a Jew. Since then that village has lived for many years with its people practising Judaism. Then a priest, who was also a monk, who had become a Jew in his heart, came to that village. He became at one with them and defiled churches with all filth. He lived blaspheming our Lord Jesus Christ and blaspheming Our Lady Mary, too. ~ One day he ate and drank with the Jewish community. The Jewish community became full with him and slept. That Jew, who was a Christian before, roared like a bull, as a bull would roar when slaughtered. The whole Jewish community awoke in a great shock and woke him up. They asked him, ""What happened to you?"" The Jew, who was a Christian before, said to them, ""Listen, that I may tell you: Jesus Christ came to me putting on the flesh of Our Lady Holy Mary, Twice Virgin, and garmented with fire and said to me: 'I am Christ! You, while a Christian priest and a monk, blasphemed me and my mother, Mary, and defiled my temple with your filth and then joined the quaternitarian and became at one with all the numerous traitors, my enemies. I, for my part, shall make seven pieces out of you by the hand of a servant of mine.' For this reason I am scared and my soul is shocked and so I roared like a bull."" When he woke up he was dizzy, without a clear mind. He told them all this when he regained consciousness. The whole Jewish community said to him, ""Are you doubting in your mind that you say all this? Do you want to be a Christian? Why did you come to us (in the first place)?"" The Jew, who was a Christian before, said to them, ""Do not say that Christ is not a king. Daniel, too, said about~: 'And there was given him dominion, and glory, and wonder, and all people and nations and tribes should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed!"" When he said this to them they murmured against him. However, they did not separate from him but lived with him according to the law of the Jews. ~One day, after his vision, God sent against him a Christian army. When the Jew, who was a Christian before, heard and saw the coming of the Christian army, he said, ""O Jewish community, take me up to (the top of) the mountain which people cannot reach either on horse or by foot."" They took him up to a high mountain. He was pleased and said to them, ""You truly did a good thing to me. As long as I am on this mountain, nothing will really happen to me. Even if the birds of the sky become horses and the stars spears, they will not be able to come here. The feet of people and horses will not be able to come here."" soon after he said these words the Christian army arrived at the bottom of the mountain. By the power of God, they ascended the mountain of the Jews and seized that Jew, who was a Christian before. They brought him down from the mountain and brought him to the one who sent them, to the one who ruled the Christians. Their ruler was pleased and prostrated himself before God three times; and with the sword which was in his hand, he struck through his neck and completely cut (his head) off. They took him out and brought him to many churches and stood him at a distant place. There, they completed dismembering him and made of him seven pieces. They then burnt his body with fire and made him ashes and gave him to the wind, as had said earlier the Son of Mary, Our Lord Jesus Christ. Truly, his dominion is an everlasting dominion which shall not pass away. ~ O Our Lady Mary, may your multitudinous goodness [be with your servant] for ever.

285,A Jew is led to baptism by a dream about a lion and a monk; afterwards he curses a Jew at the latter's request.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed,"<p>It was in a place where mostly Jews lived.</p>
<p>The Christians who lived there were few.</p>
<p>When a young Jew heard these [the Christians] speak of the Christian teaching, he began to say, “Is the faith of Christians true, or is it the faith of Jews?”</p>
<p>One day, while he was sleeping, he saw in a dream a fire surrounding him to the right and to the left, and many flashes of lightning. The fire left its dwelling toward the house where he was and seized him. </p>
<p>The Jew cried out in his dream.</p>
<p>While he cried, a lion came from the east, roaring.</p>
<p>The young Jew was afraid and said, “I devote myself to the God of Daniel.”</p>
<p>To the fire he said, “I devote myself to the God of Hananiah, of Azariah and of Mishael. ” And he invoked the name of God.</p>
<p>When he had said this, the lion mellowed (?), as if it were laughing.</p>
<p>Behind him was (a being), resembling a monk, in whose hand was a staff [bâton] of iron.</p>
<p>When the lion grew closer to either the fire or the flashes of lightning, these grew afraid and flowed backwards.</p>
<p>The fire was covered by a veil (?) to the left.</p>
<p>The lion called the young Jew by his name and said to him, “Come.” And it arrived beside him and took him by the right hand.</p>
<p>Then the lion made a cross (upon his hand) with its claws and said to the monk, “Take the staff of iron that is in your hand and place the whole of this staff of iron in the blaze: it will be as an ember.”</p>
<p>It said (again) to the monk: “Come, make a cross.” The monk made a cross with the burning iron there where the lion had made a cross with its claws.</p>
<p>The lion said to the young Jew, “You happen to rot of a great putridness.” </p>
<p>The young Jew said to it, “Do the best for me, as you wish it.”</p>
<p>The lion said to him, “Come, so that I might lead you to the clear sea that is beneath the chasm.” And it led the young Jew to the clear sea.</p>
<p>The lion said to the young Jew, “Throw yourself down, in this clear sea, and your putridness will be taken away from you.”</p>
<p>The young Jew threw himself in the sea and immersed himself.</p>
<p>When he immersed himself in the clear sea, he awoke and cried in terror.</p>
<p>From that day, he began to love the Christians with a perfect love.</p>
<p>After that, he was baptised and became Christian.</p>
<p>After that, he became a priest, made himself a monk, and learned the Holy Scripture. He returned to his birthplace to preach the name of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>One day, a Sunday, he began to teach the Christians and the Jews.</p>
<p>One of the Jews who loved him previously said to him, “Come, so that I might tell you something one-on-one.”</p>
<p>This Jew spoke to the young Jew, who was a priest and monk, and said to him, “Monk, is it from your heart that you love Christ and have faith in Mary, or is it (only) from your mouth, as you had previously been?” </p>
<p>The Jew, who was a priest and monk, began to curse him in the name of Jesus Christ and in the name of the Virgin Mary, saying, “May Jesus Christ, Son of God, annihilate you, and may Mary also annihilate you.</p>
<p>“May he who drowned the Pharaoh in the Red Sea drown you as well.” And he cursed him with every curse in the name of Jesus Christ and in the name of Mary.</p>
<p>When he had cursed him, the other Jew let out a great laugh, rejoiced, and said to him, “Curse me again.”</p>
<p>And this Jew left, laughing.</p>
<p>He was the prefect of the town.</p>
<p>The young Jew, who was a priest and monk, returned to his house crying and saying, “O my Lady, show me your miracle upon this man.”</p>
<p>The young Jew, who was a priest and monk, while meditating, met a companion, a young Jew who was a priest and a monk.  Both were children of Jews.</p>
<p>He [original young Jew] told him [the new young Jew] how the other Jew had blasphemed against Our Lady Mary and her Son. The children of Jews both cried.</p>
<p>They were priests and monks.</p>
<p>They said to Our Lady Mary, Mother of God, “Listen to what we ask of you: show us one of your miracles upon this Jew who blasphemed against you and against your Son, so that we might not be in doubt, we your servants whom the love for you and the love for your son have made captives far from our fathers and far from our parents.”</p>
<p>When they had finished praying, they went to sleep in distress and in tears.</p>
<p>On Monday, the Jew [the one who blasphemed] began to go to his house beside his wife and his children. He arrived at the river, crossed the river, and stripped to plunge himself in the river.</p>
<p>He sat upon a big rock that was on the river bank, of an unmovable base. (?)</p>

The miracle and wonder which she worked for a wife of a ruler, by the power of her beloved Son. May her prayer be with her slave Ma'eqäbä Egzi' Amen. There was a ruler in a great country from among the countries of the Christians. He had a wife from a family of good people. He loved her dearly. The woman lived for some time with her husband. She, however, was very sorrowful that she could not have children. She lived praying to God the highest and to Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary that she might give her a blessed son who would please her. There was also the mother of the woman whom we mentioned earlier, a good and God-fearing woman, a lover of saints and lover of Christians, of good family. She lived praying to Our Holy [f.l76r] Lady Twice Virgin Mary that she might give her/daughter a blessed and chosen child saying, "" saying, ""How long will you remain barren like God and to Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary who would fear God and please Our Holy Lady daughter answered her saying, ""Yes, I am praying; Lady Twice Virgin Mary that she would give please us and delight Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin with all good deeds. They asked Our Holy Lady she might fulfill their wish and comfort them in them.  Once the ruler, the husband of the woman whom called her and said to her, ""How long will you rogation for forty days and forty nights and ask Mary. You pray persistently; I, too, will pray Twice Virgin Mary because she is tender-hearted; prayer and give us a good son who will delight Having admonished her so, he let her go to her mother all that her husband had ordered her. When her mother heard this matter from her daughter (the idea) pleased her. They both prepared them- selves to fast and started to fast the holy fast of Lent.3W hile they were fasting for God and for Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary, the tender-hearted, before they finished the fast of Lent, three days before its end, the wife of the ruler saw a wonderful and an astounding vision while sleeping by night. The woman who saw (the vision) said:  While I was asleep in my bed, I found myself praying in a certain place. While I was praying, a certain man of light appeared to me suddenly holding a cane in his left hand and a cross of light in his right hand. He came to me and said to me, ""Peace to you, rise up egälit 4. Behold, God has heard your prayer. You shall bear a child who shall be useful to the whole [world], who will be a chosen one in the kingdom of God."" Having said this, he brought out with his right hand clean incense. Two (grains) fell down on the ground. When they fell down, I said, to the man, ""I doubt,"" and I explained to him saying, ""Of those you gave me, two fell down on the ground while I was receiving, but before I had received (them) from your hand; however, I took into my hand the one which is the best of them."" The man of light answered me again saying, ""Leave those; the best one which you took suffices you."" When he spoke like this to me, I was pleased. I took that clean incense in my hand and asked the man of light saying, ""What is your name, my lord? Who are you sent from?"" The (man) of light answered me saying, ""I am Bârtâloméwos [= Bartholomew], the Apostle of Our Lord Jesus Christ. God Our Lord sent me to you."" I asked him with pleasure, saying, ""What is this in- cense? And what is its significance?"" The (man) of light interpreted for me like this, saying, ""God sent me to you to tell you and to announce (this) to you. This is the significance of the incense: This incense which you saw, the one that is better than the other two, which you took with your hand, is a sign for the son whom God shall give you, who will be useful for the whole world.""  When I heard this annunciation from the mouth of the man of light, [f. 176r] thanked God, /who is praised through me, My Lord, and my Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary, the support of my head. She went on: ""While I was standing with the man of light, Satan came behind me. In the likeness of a beast called chamelion, he came in haste, opening his mouth, wanting to do evil to me. By the mercy of God, I turned my face to the man of light, and said to him, 'That animal wants to destroy me. O, Holy God, My Lord, help me and save me from the death of Sheol.'  Then the Apostle stirred with anger at the beast that was elated. The Apostle thrashed the beast heavily with his stick, and scattered it like burned pieces of cloth, and made him like nothing, that had never been conceived."" And now may God cover us with hi$ great compassion, and grant us entrance into the bright and shining house of his Trinity, and to me his slave, too. Amen.  When the wife of the ruler woke up from her sleep, she told her mother all of the vision she had seen. When her mother heard, she thanked God and Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary saying:  ""God has heard me; he who is not aloof from his own is not aloof from me, but heard me, for he has accepted my word."" She was stunned and astounded by the vision because she was filled with relief. May God clothe me, his slave, the flowery purple cloth of his Trinity.""  When the wife of the ruler completed the rogation of the forty days, when the days were over, the ruler called his wife and was admitted unto her. The woman conceived by the prayer of Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary, Mother of God. Before (the child) was conceived and before it was born and also after it was born, good saints and those to whom Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary appeared bore witness saying, ""It is fulfilled for you; Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary shall give you a male child who will be useful and pleasing."" From here on, she lived thanking God and Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary. Her day of delivery came, and she gave birth to a male child on the memorial day of Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary, on the 21st of the month of Terr. When the ruler heard that his wife had given birth to a male child, he praised God and thanked Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary. When the (period) of forty days (since his birth) was completed, they took the child to the church of Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary to baptize him. They baptized the child and called his name, his baptismal name, Bäsenˀa Maryam. But the mother of the wife of the ruler called the name of the child of her daughter Bârtâloméwos [= Bartholomew]. Then everyone went home. The mother of the child, too, went home in peace. They lived in great pleasure, making the memorial of Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary every year on the 21st of the month of Terr. They thanked Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary.  The child grew up by the power of God, his God, and by the power of Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary, his support. His father called the child and saw him and was pleased. He said to the nurse, ""Did my son grow like this without suckling?"" The nurse of the child said, [f.l77r] ""Yes,/ your son, my lord, grew without suckling. He did not suckle more than five months."" When the father heard (this), he admired and said, ""Truly, Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary nursed this child of mine. As of now, may the name of this child be Bâtârgéla Maryam"" Since then the child was called Bâtârgéla Maryam. After sometime, the ruler took his son, the child, to the church of Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary and incised his face with a razor and gave him to Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin [Mary], and made him take refuge with her to guard him with her hand in this world and in the world to come. The child grew up by the prayer of Our Lady Twice Virgin Mary Mother of God, the Mother of Our Lord Jesus Christ. May Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary bless today our community; she is the ladder of our prayer and our power forever. Amen. Listen my fathers and brothers, the Christian Orthodox people. This child was conceived and born by the petition of our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary and from her Son because he became the son of her house.6 The child said: ""My Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary became my support. When my soul was about to come out because of the severity of the pain of my illness, she brought me back and healed me well by the mercy of her beloved Son. And her compassion was on me all of a sudden."" And now, may Our Lady Mary grant me entrance into the Kingdom of Heaven, to me your slave.

There rose against the child envious and corrupt people whom Satan used as lyre and horn. They accused many of the children of the ruler, and many were destroyed by the accusation of the cursed Satan, some with flogging and some with imprisonment. Many of the messengers of Satan accused him to the ruler saying, ""This child is at one with them; he did not separate from them."" When the ruler heard (this) from many fraudulent people, he imprisoned the child. The child remained with his two imprisoned brothers. In those days there broke on the whole population a fatal pestilence that was unspeakable. On a certain night, while the child was asleep, he saw before him an icon of Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary with her beloved child, and an icon of the Crucifixion of her Son, too.

When the pestilence intensified on the whole earth, the ruler gave an order to his son(s) and his daughters at the palace of the ruler - he gave orders to all men and women - to hold rogation to God the highest and to Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary. Bâtârgéla Maryam was in constant attendance, with his brothers, at the palace of the ruler, his father. A brother of Bâtârgéla Maryam died of pestilence while he was together with him. As for Bâtârgéla Maryam, no pain did touch him at all, because he did not experience pestilence at all; he was guarded by the hand of Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary. There was a man, a nephew of Bâtârgéla Maryam, a wicked man cut off by the sword of anathema. He was the father of Satan, (his) equal. Although I say to you ""equal,"" he was not strong but weaker than women. (Furthermore,) he never knew the work of God nor learnt all arts of war like the children of kings and governors. He only lived accusing Bâtârgéla Maryam with his brothers. There was also a man whom they call Mâsârréy at the palace of the ruler who accused Bâtârgéla Maryam to the ruler, his father. Listen my fathers and brothers: It was not two or three persons who opposed him but many people; God knows their number. But Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary delivered him from them. And as for his enemies, she crippled them by the power of her beloved Son. This is Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary, the pride and the power of Christians. When the wicked and fraudulent increased the (false) accusations against Bâtârgéla Maryam to his father, the ruler, and the ruler listened to the accusations of the rebels, the ruler became angry with his son Bâtârgéla Maryam and gave the order that his hands be shackled. They shackled him with two persons in order that they might watch him. There was a wicked man called Sebbuha Amlak. He, together with the son of an infidel, accused Bâtârgéla Maryam to the ruler many times. Even after he was imprisoned, he never ceased for an hour accusing Bâtârgéla Maryam to the ruler, his father. But Bâtârgéla Maryam cried and lamented to Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary saying, ""O Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary, I was conceived by the order of your Son and born by the power of your prayer. Have not my father and my mother delivered me to you by incising my face? Delay not your help from me, but have compassion upon me quickly."" Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary is tender-hearted to all creatures; she had compassion on him; she made the heart of the ruler tender. The ruler gave order that they untie his left hand from the shackle, twelve days after he was shackled. When he was united from the shackle of the left hand those pernicious ones were put to shame, but they still continued accusing him. Listen my fathers and brothers, the sheep of the Gospel, Bâtârgéla Maryam incised himself with a razor for Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary on the day of her conception by Joachim in the womb of Anne on the 7th of (the month of) Nâhasé. And on that day his left hand was untied from the shackle, and the ruler called him to a church to take with him the body and the blood of Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, which was given for the forgiveness of sin and for the preservation of the soul and the body. He lived praying diligent y to God, the Lord, and to Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary, daughter of Judah and daughter of Levi the sacrificer. Bâtârgéla Maryam started in faith the fast of (the month of) Nâhasé, which is called the fast of Mary, until the day of the Assumption of Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary, from this world of darkness into the Garden of happiness. When the Holy day of the Assumption of Our Lady Twice Virgin Mary came, the ruler called that wicked man called Sabbuha Amlak, who accused Bâtârgéla Maryam, on the eve of the holy day of Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary. In the morning, when it was (time of) Communion, the ruler went to Church, for he was a beloved one of Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary. He sent to Bâtârgéla Maryam saying thus, ""Let them untie you from the shackle of your right hand for the sake of the name of Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary. Come quickly so that you may take the Communion with us."" When the messenger told this message to Bâtârgéla Maryam, Bâtârgéla Maryam was happy and joyful. They untied him from the shackle. He went to the church and took the Holy Mystery which is the body and blood of Jesus Christ. They spent the day rejoicing and thanking God in canticles and songs. When they finished singing the canticles of Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary, everyone went home with the ruler. Bâtârgéla Maryam, too, went to his lodging in pleasure and joy. On the third day, Our Holy Lady Twice Virgin Mary, through the hand of her slave the ruler, thrashed that infidel called Sebbuha Amlak who lived accusing Bâtârgéla Maryam.

290,"Däbrä Məṭmaq miracles: When the destruction of Däbrä Məṭmaq is reported in Ethiopia in the time of Patriarch John of Alexandria (d. 1452), the king Zärˀa Yaˁəqob  orders the construction of a new monastery to take its place.",,"<p>        There was in the days of Achraf  king of Cairo a great persecution against the churches, in the days of the pontificate of our father John [Jean], patriarch of the city of Alexandria .</p>
<p>        Alas, all the Muslims who were at Sandafâ, al-Mehallâ and Dabra Metmâq assembled by the design of Satan their father. They contemplated an evil design, saying “This day is that which we wish.”</p>
<p>        They said to themselves, “Come, let us go beside the king Achraf and inform him of the history of this church which seduces our people, so that the king may order for it to be destroyed. And so, we will have tranquility in that which concerns the church [it]. Before, the bishop abbâ Michael [Michel] forbade us from demolishing it, because it was his diocesan seat [siège].”</p>
<p>        After saying this to themselves, they went beside the king Achraf.</p>
<p>        They said to him, “Our Lord, in your days the faith is upright, and our people go [marche] according to our law. We came now before you to inform you, knowing your zeal. There is a church which was constructed in the name of Mary on the territory of Sandafâ, which is called Dabra Metmâq. Each year there appears the one called Mary with an assembly of angels, for five days during the month of genbot. Because of that, all the people are seduced. Certain people embrace the Christian faith.</p>
<p>        “When Michael the bishop was there, he seduced many people by the flattery of his speech. When there appeared overtly the one called Mary, he brought them into his faith and made them Christians. After he brought them into his faith, we do not know what happened.”</p>
<p>        When the king heard that, he was strongly irritated and said to them, “This bishop who seduces our people, is he here?”</p>
<p>        They responded and said to him, “Actually no, because he went beside the king of Ethiopia on a mission.”</p>
<p>        The king said, “If he were here, I would have had him burned alive!”</p>
<p>        He interrogated them again, saying, “The one called Mary, does she truly appear in the church?”</p>
<p>        They said to him, “Yes, she appears. She does not appear alone, but angels who have wings appear as well. There come too spiritual men who ride horses, whom the Christians call ‘martyrs.’ Once arrived, they descend from their horses and prostrate themselves at the feet of the one called Mary. Luminous angels prostrate themselves as well before her, when we, we see them . If the Christians ask her for their relatives who died long ago, she brings them and makes them see their relatives. The Christians say that they appear to them under their appearance of before. When Michael the bishop was here, she threw him a handkerchief.</p>
<p>        “He said to his people, ‘Is it you who threw it to Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary mother of God?’</p>
<p>        “They said to him no, and he did not believe them until he had made them swear upon his cross. Next, Michael the bishop instituted that this handkerchief was for them a blessing, when we, we saw that affair.</p>
<p>        “With similar things, they seduced our people. And they joined the Christians. Now, o king, order the demolition of the church so that we may be at rest in that which concerns it. If this church is not demolished, there will not remain anyone in your kingdom who holds [tienne] in the law of the Muslims.”</p>
<p>        When Achraf the king of Cairo heard this speech, he was amazed. He hardened his heart, like Pharaon the king of Egypt had hardened his heart, so that the power of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary Mother of God, would be revealed.</p>
<p>        Next, the king ordered the demolition of the holy church.</p>
<p>        He sent, with the informers, the soldiers of Satan to demolish it.</p>
<p>        When the Christians learned of that, they felt a great affliction with the patriarch John. They promised to the Muslims to give them a lot of gold.</p>
<p>        The Muslims refused, because Satan had filled their heart with a choleric zeal. They hastened to demolish the church. When they had demolished Zion [Sion], the Christians lamented by saying, “How has the city of our salvation been ruined? Upon you has arrived that which Isaiah said : How has God covered Zion with clouds !</p>
<p>        “That which Micah the prophet said has arrived: Because of you, one will plough Zion like a field and the House will be like a wood .”</p>
<p>        And the people cried.</p>
<p>        The people [it, il] said, “In truth it is because of our sins that you have been ruined, house of God and house of Our Lady Mary the Virgin!”</p>
<p>        The day when the church was ruined, Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary mother of God, appeared to the impious king and to all the dignitaries with whom he had decided to destroy the church; to all (she appeared) at the same moment, saying, “Do not say, ‘It is by our power and by the force of our hands that we have destroyed the church of Mary.’</p>
<p>        “Simply, I have delivered it in your hands because of the sins of my people. As God said, ‘The holy city of Jerusalem, I delivered it into the hand of Nabuchodonosor, king of Babylon .’</p>
<p>        “Now, know that on this day I will show my power against you, to the point where you will be a subject of discussion for all the people who are around you .”</p>
<p>        The next morning, all the great dignitaries of the royal house assembled and all recounted with the same voice this vision.</p>
<p>        The king said to them, “I as well saw this vision.”</p>
<p>        When they were assembled, they were amazed by this vision that they had all seen on the same night.</p>
<p>        And so, the impious king became crazy with his dignitaries. They began to tear themselves apart like dogs. The king also gave an order and sent soldiers to burn the city. Next he died of an evil death with his dignitaries, becoming the object of mockery and derision for all.</p>
<p>        After that, the Christian people assembled with the patriarch abbâ John. They sent a message to our king Zara Yâqob, saying, “Know, o our lord and our king, that because of our sin the sanctuary of God Dabra Metmâq was ruined, the mother of monasteries, the river of milk and honey, the pride of the Christians, the place of their glorious splendor. Now it is a pasture for sheep and cows. Because of that, cry upon us, faithful people of Ethiopia, because of our glory which is lost. Cry upon us because of Zion, our mother who nourished us with her mammary and perfumed us with the aroma of her perfume. Now, she has abandoned us to make us orphans.”</p>
<p>        When our king Zara Yâqob, the friend of God, heard this speech, he felt a great affliction.</p>
<p>        He made George [Georges] enter, the spiritual son of abbâ Michael, and said to him, “Happily, happily that our father has not seen nor learned of the loss of Dabra Metmâq! On the contrary there was justice and peace during his days, as said the Scripture .”</p>
<p>        He said to him next, “Read the letter which came from the part of our father the patriarch abbâ John.</p>
<p>        George received the letter and read it.</p>
<p>        When he arrived at the ruin of Dabra Metmâq where, little child, he had been nourished –and he had grown at the mammary of its delights –he shed tears and strongly lamented.</p>
<p>        Next our king Zara Yâqob, the chief of kings at the upright faith, began to console him, as is said by Ezra the prophet, “Console Zion .”</p>
<p>        Likewise, he consoled him by saying, “Having left your affliction and this lamentation of yours, be enduring towards the pain that has reached you, because if God returns justice to your wish, you will find Dabra Metmâq again.”</p>
<p>        Next, he constructed a church in a beautiful manner.</p>
<p>        He called it Dabra Metmâq.</p>
<p>        The word of the prophet was accomplished, which said: The glory of the final house is worth more than that of the first .</p>
<p>        And so, our king said, “Today is accomplished the word of David the prophet, who said: Jerusalem, built as a city, those who are like her are united with her .</p>
<p>        “From now on, too he will be flustered [confondu], he who will say, ‘Happily, happily!’”</p>
<p>        Glory to God the Father, God of gods, who chose Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary mother of God, among all the women, and made her the abode of her Son, source of life!</p>
<p>        Praise to the Son who covered [revêtu; put on, adorned] his body without sin!</p>
<p>        Blessing to the Holy Spirit who made her a virgin in two manners, which were not given to the angels! [Translation as of 05/21/22]</p>

291,"When Satan destroys the oven of a monastery, he is compelled to serve the monks for twelve years in punishment.",Africa Egypt probably,"<p>        It was in a city in the territory of Egypt, there was a monastery of monks.</p>
<p>        Seeing the zeal of those there, the devil tried them, knocked over their oven and filled it with dust.</p>
<p>        As the monks no longer had something to bake their bread, they begged Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, the maker of miracles and wonders.</p>
<p>        Accepting their request, she said to them, “He who knocked over your oven is the devil, he will serve you like a slave for twelve years. From now on, do not be distressed, because I have interceded beside my Son so that you may subjugate the devil by the power of the divinity of my Son. Do not rejoice for this, because you will obtain a greater grace than that, by the power of my prayer, in the skies. Have you not heard that which my Son said to his disciples in the holy Gospel, ‘If the demons obey you, do not rejoice for that; but rejoice, because your names are written in the skies ’?”</p>
<p>        For the accomplishment of the word of the Gospel, the devil served them by the power of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, the maker of miracles and wonders.</p>
<p>        They commanded him first to take out quickly the dust from their oven, which he had filled it with. They commanded him also to grind (grain); he grinded it and brought it to them quickly. They commanded him again to knock down a tree; he brought it to them, carrying it, (a tree) that two hundred men could not carry.</p>
<p>        Seeing that, the monks admired Our Lady Mary, mother of God.</p>
<p>        To the devil they said, “With what were you able to carry it?”</p>
<p>        He responded and said to them, “If it does not suffice for you, command me to add that which your heart wishes.”</p>
<p>        The people in the city said amongst themselves, “First we had been tried by this devil and we were distressed. Now, we rejoice, because we rest of all our pains since Our Lady Mary gave us this devil, so that he may serve us as a slave.”</p>
<p>        The monks commanded again the devil to bring them fish. In compliance, he brought them a whale.</p>
<p>        Upon that whale was a great boat with its merchants, with sailors and numerous treasures, innumerable, of these merchants.</p>
<p>        As for the sea (which it had traversed ?), she was as vast as the equivalent of a year long voyage.</p>
<p>        (The sailors) made the whale approach rapidly, the boat and all that there was.</p>
<p>        When the monks saw that, they trembled and said to the devil, “By what artifice have you done this?”</p>
<p>        He said to them, “I have brought them to you so that you may buy what you want. You have commanded a single thing of me, regarding fish; but I, I have done many things for you, that you have not commanded of me, so that you may let me go to my companions.”</p>
<p>        The monks said to him, “We will not let you leave before you have reached where was commanded of you by Our Lady Mary, to (the term of) twelve years.”</p>
<p>        They said to the people of the boat, “Why have you obeyed one who you did not know before, and who is not your master?”</p>
<p>        The people of the boat said to them, “We did not know our thought: he removed our heart and brought us beside you in an instant.”</p>
<p>        The monks responded, saying, “It is not he who made you come by his power, but it is by the power of Our Lady Mary that you have come. Do not admire this devil for this, but admire the queen of the skies above, Mary, who have given us this devil, so that he may serve us. First, he had stayed to try us by knocking over our oven, now he does all that we want by the power of Our Lady Mary.”</p>
<p>        Having heard this miracle, the pagans said, “Your faith is better than our faith. Baptize us so that we may become Christians.”</p>
<p>        The monks baptized them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>        They taught them belief in the holy Trinity and in the unique baptism for the pardon of sin.</p>
<p>        Next, the merchants gave all their goods to the church of Our Lady Mary.</p>
<p>        (The wood of) their boat was for the door, the windows and the needs of all kinds.</p>
<p>        Its iron was for the nails, the keys and the instruments of work (?).</p>
<p>        The people of the boat all made themselves monks in this monastery. They became priests and pleased Our Lady in their priesthood and in their monastic state.</p>
<p>        As for the devil, having finished his service after twelve years, he went to his companions.</p>
<p>        Commemorating this miracle, the assembly of this monastery of monks praised Our Lady.</p>
<p>        The people of the boat who had become Christians redoubled love for Our Lady Mary and celebrated her festival.</p>
<p>        That was marvelous for those who heard of it. They returned grace to Our Lady with numerous actions of grace.</p>
<p>        As for us, children of this monastery, praise her in glory and honor so that she may guard us from the hand of the unknown Enemy.</p>
<p>        That her prayer and her intercession may be for us a rampart, and encircle us like an effective shield, for centuries upon centuries, amen. [Translation as of 05/21/22]</p>

Fol. 71b.] NOW there was a certain man who was washing his clothes in a stream, and another man came and turned aside the water thereof into another channel. And the man who was washing his clothes said unto that man, ""By the prayer of our holy Lady, the Virgin twofold, Mary, the God-bearer, let this water alone""; but the man filched away the water in spite of him, and cursing him that was washing his clothes twice and thrice refused to let the water alone. And at that moment the running water turned backwards and flowed up the hill, and all the people gathered together [to see it] and they marvelled at what had taken place. And the water continued to flow up the hill for many days, and then, by the Will of God, the river returned to its former bed. Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933.

319,King Dawit (1382-1413) miracles: Saint Mary makes a covenant with King Dawit of Ethiopia.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed,"A miracle of Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin, the Holy Spirit, Mary, Mariham; may her intercession be with our Dengel, with Abunä (= Metropolitan) Mareqos and with all of forever. Amen. There was a Christian king, a lover of God, whose faith was orthodox, and whose actions were good. He loved Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin, the Ark of the Holy Spirit, Mary, Mariham, with all his heart and with all his soul. Out of his exceeding love for her, he had an image (icon) statuette made in her likeness and adorned (it) with gold and silver and precious stones. He prayed constantly with this image, day and night. He honored it exceedingly in fear and trembling. Whenever he would stand for prayer by that image, it seemed to him that he was standing before his Creator, and so his eyes would shed burning tears and all his members would be trembling and terror-struck, Whenever he would pray (standing) by that image, all his concern(s) and the desire(s) of his heart would be granted and fulfilled. There were times when the image spoke to him openly; and there were times when it spoke to him through visions. One day he prayed with persevering heart, lamenting and weeping, f. 63v/ while standing by the image (of) Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin, the Ark of the Holy Spirit, Mary, Mariham, saying, ""O My Lady, I ask you that you receive the yearning of my mind, testing my heart and reins (to see) that I love you from the depth of my heart. Behold, this is my petition, O My Lady. If you do not let me inherit the Heavenly Kingdom as well together with the elect kings who have pleased you with all their hearts, take my soul away from this kingdom of the corruptible world, whose passing away is like a shadow and a borrowed garment. I just take refuge in you that you may say, ""yes,"" to me, and may not neglect the supplication of me, your sinful servant, because it has been vouchsafed to you from the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit that you receive the prayer of us, your people, and obtain the remission of our sins, for to you is meet thanksgiving, glory, worship, power and might at all times, forever and ever. Amen. When he finished his prayer, Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin, the Ark of the Holy Spirit, Mary, Mariham, came to him openly, not in a vision or in a dream, and said to him, ""O My beloved one, behold I have obtained for you from my Son, Jesus Christ, all that you have asked f. 64r from me. It is not only to you alone that the Kingdom/ of Heaven shall be given; but to all of your children who have come from your loins the Kingdom of Heaven shall be given. As for the earthly Kingdom there shall be some among your children that shall reign and some that shall not reign; the Kingdom of Heaven, however, is vouchsafed to all of them, without discriminating against any one of them. I have given you this convenant while you are alive, that is, that you and your children inherit the Kingdom of Heaven."" Having said this, Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin, the Ark of the Holy Spirit, Mary, Mariham, was hidden from him. All this that happented (was) because of the love of Our Lady. See, O doves of the Gospel, the greatness of the generosity and the goodness of this damsel, the Mother of Emmanuel. To a man who loves her from the depths of his heart, when he asks and prays, she bestows an earthly kingdom as well as the Heavenly Kingdom, which is the greatest and the highest. May her prayer and her blessing be with all of her servants and maids, forever and ever. Amen. Now, too, we pray and supplicate you O Mary, Virgin, Mother of the Sovereign.

321,"Holy Family journey cycle: The rich Egyptian woman who refused to give water to the Holy Family. (321, 322, 325, 431 similar)",,"<p>When Our Lady Mary heard that Herod had killed children, she raised her eyes to heaven and said “Lord, judge between us and Herod. We have done anything evil against him but he [Herod] persecutes us. Immediately, an angel appeared and said “Be patient for a little while, O my Lady. For the day in which Herod will be killed is approaching. Rather, [that day is approaching] not just for Herod but all of those who hate your son and you.”  After speaking thus the angel disappeared from her [Mary’s] eyes. Our Lady Mary dwelt in the wilderness for three days. Then, she prayed in Hebrew “Kiermyal, Afdakoda, Yoda, Halmna, Yasoros, Bnyakaiel, sorobosb, Rossab, Erdad, Lamyanos, eilmas, Ttierattienbyos, listen to me, your servant. Save me from this suffering.” </p>
<p>Immediately two angels named Mersobyos and Mesobyos  came to her. They stood before Mary holding bread and a cup. They gave it to Our Lady Mary. Our Lady Mary gave it to the people of the town.  </p>
<p>The angels bowed down before Our Lady Mary and ascended to heaven. Our Lady Mary and those with her ate that bread and drunk that cup and remained in that place for three days. Then, they moved on and reached a mountain named Arkisan . They stayed there for three days. They did not eat or drink anything. </p>
<p>Then, Joseph said to Our Lady Mary “O My Lady, behold there are houses near to us. Let us go to them. For they [the people who live in the houses] are also humans like us. Our Lady Mary replied “Leave us to stay in this wilderness. If Herod sends spies, they will follow us and our life will perish.”</p>
<p>Joseph said “How can Herod know that we have come down from Egypt?”</p>
<p>Our Lady Mary replied “Alright. Let it be as you say, O my Father.” </p>
<p>They went to the city at the 6th hour . They reached a city named Ttlmieda.  They entered the house of one noblewoman who was greater than all the people of the city. Our Lady Mary said “[Please,] give me milk for my son. If you have, [please give me] bread too.” Our Lady Mary put down the child on the ground. The noble woman [began] to question Our Lady Mary, “From where is this traveller woman?” </p>
<p>Lady Mary replied “From Bethlehem of Judah.”</p>
<p>The woman said “Why are you wandering around, woman? Did you do such and such [bad] things? You should avoid such a habit. Your countenance is beautiful. But your power is weak, your heart is wicked and slothful.”    </p>
<p>When Our Lady Mary heard this replied “Where did you know me before now?” </p>
<p>The woman said “A person is known by the manner of his travel.”</p>
<p>Our Lady Mary replied “All what you said is true. For I have received all this because of my sin.” </p>
<p>Our Lady Mary began to beat her chest. She raised her eyes and began to weep remembering the nature of her father and her mother. </p>
<p>A stone would have been broken. A wall of light would have been broken. But, the heart of T ‘eman  did not return [to compassion]. Rather she [T ‘eman] was laughing like a wine bibber. </p>
<p>Joseph said to T ‘eman “It would be fitting to give to a guest something, if one has. If one doesn’t have anything to give, it is also fitting to send the guest away in peace [without ridiculing them]. Why are you speaking such a bitter speech that spikes the heart like an arrow?”</p>
<p>T ‘eman replied “I am justified to call you ‘goat herder!’. How dare you try to teach me manners?” She glanced at him in wrath from head to toe. </p>
<p>When T ‘eman’s servant saw her mistress’ anger, she came out rumbling the earth. That servant was from the tribe of Kam. She was as dark as the Crow. She had one five years old son. She picked up the child [Jesus] with her right hand and threw him away. The child rolled on the ground like a rock. Our Lady Mary, Joseph and Salome rose up and picked up the child [Jesus]. They returned back to that woman to see what was going to happen to her.  The earth opened its mouth and swallowed that woman like Dathan and Abiram.    She went straight to Sheol in body and soul together. Her servant became a rhinoceros whose skin was half balck and half white. The son of the servant, the husband of T ‘eman, all of them [her family] became Baboons. They fled together to the mountains. There was no one left from their family. The people of the city became terrified. </p>
<p>Our Lady Mary and her family entered the house of T ‘eman. They found a golden bed with a canopy over it, three containers of wine, three epah (66 Liters) of 7 years old mead, 7 cor [1540 kilograms] of Wheat in sealed [containers], 7 cor [1540 kilograms] of oil, and many more other numerous blessings. Our Lady Mary and Joseph prostrated themselves on the ground because they were terrified [of the divine justice that happened against their enemy and the blessing they were bestowed]. </p>
<p>Our Lady Mary said in Hebrew “Sorosoroyarosok, Yakarmiel, Pipiyaiel, Pprsbos, Gwurguasebay, Adielie’, Mtwafon.  I praise you! I bless you! You have made the wild animals martyrs and the humans into wild animals. You humble the conceited and lift up the humble. There is nothing impossible to you, who have bestowed on me the house of T ‘eman. As she laughed at me, others laughed at her.” </p>
<p>Joseph became the steward of the banquet. He rises up and pours out from the wine and gives it to them [the Holy Family].  First, Our Lady Mary, Joseph, and Salome drank. Then, the three children of Joseph drank. </p>
<p>Our Lady Mary said to the child “Drink more of what they refused to give you a little bit! Come drink more!”</p>
<p>Joseph said to Our Lady Mary “O My Lady, I have never seen or heard anything like this! How wonderful is what the Lord has done on that woman and her entire family!” Our Lady Mary replied to Joseph “Yes, the Lord has done wonder that it might be a remembrance for the later years.” </p>
<p>They [the Holy Family] stayed there for 2 months and 5 days. May her prayer and her blessing be with her servant Gebre Maryam forever and ever. Amen.                    [Translation as of 05/21/22]</p>

327,The three pious priests and monks who wore fine clothes.,,"<p>There was, in a monastery, three chosen priests, good and versed in the word of the books of the Old and the New (Testament).</p>
<p>They loved to don precious clothing, pectoral and pantaloons. They placed a silk turban on their hood. They also loved spiced food and delicious drinks. And the beautiful beds and the soft mattresses which softened adolescents [qui amollissent les adolescents]. But they had been guarded in the nave of their body  [corps] and had in no way been submerged by the power of winds and waves of the desire of the flesh.</p>
<p>All those who saw them would mock them because of the beauty of their clothes, and they would insult them because of their youth without knowing the purity of their body.</p>
<p>Besides, more than the love of their fathers and mothers, more than the love of their soul, they felt love for Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary.</p>
<p>When they mentioned her name, they leaped, reveled and stomped their feet [frappaient des pieds] until the hymn of celebration of her name was concluded, without resting and without ceasing for a single instant. The sweat of their face and of all their members was as if they had a fountain of water on their head. </p>
<p>After the three monks were continuing [furent restés] for numerous days to  don and put on precious clothing, a brother amongst the spiritual children of the monastery came beside them, wanting to go in another monastery to celebrate a festival. He asked one of these three monks to give him his ornate clothing.</p>
<p>This monk here gave it to him and the brother went where he wanted, to celebrate the festival. While the brother was coming back from there where he had gone on his voyage, the three monks sitting together in the courtyard of the church saw him clothed in the precious clothing which he had borrowed.</p>
<p>When he who had lent it saw him, he said to his companions, “See this brother, my friends, is it that, like him, I am odious and held in contempt in the eyes of all the people, the same as he is today, for me, held in contempt and odious when I see him?”</p>
<p>His companions responded and said to him, “To us too, when we see him, this clothing appears to us as dirtiness and garbage.”</p>
<p>From that day, these blessed men no longer put on their finery of clothing. </p>
<p>See, my brothers, how the Holy Spirit united these three men as if (they spoke) from a single mouth, as says Our Lord in the Gospel of the kingdom, “There where two or three are gathered in my name, I am amidst them .”</p>
<p>He says still, “By the mouth of two or three witnesses the whole affair is established .”</p>
<p>These holy men each took then their clothes, tidied them each in three furnishings [meubles] at the altar and exited, having kissed and greeted the numerous altars which were there.</p>
<p>They went again to the tomb of their holy fathers, who died in upright faith, by saying, “If the good pleasure of God brings us to the city of Jerusalem, may there be our death and our tomb.”</p>
<p>They left in haste to the countryside like the man of war who leaves to assail the enemy of his master. These blessed men left to the assault, having clothed themselves with cow skins, by saying, “This is the clothing of our father Adam, our father of all.”</p>
<p>They abandoned all the hymns that they knew, save the psalms of David and save the salutations of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary Mother of God. They were akin to senseless people while they were wise by the books of the Law and the Prophets and also by the books of the Gospel and the apostles, contemplating the warning of saint Paul, tongue of balm, according to that which he says in saying, God chose the senseless of this world to bring shame upon the wise .</p>
<p>While they were in such a state, they arrived in a monastery when the time of winter approached – on the road which they wished to follow. They stayed there, awake day and night, in fast and in prayer, devoting themselves also to the needs of the holy men, according to the commandment of the community.</p>
<p>One amongst them was working at the millstone, the second chopping wood and the third, collecting water. All three resided in this way.</p>
<p>When the days of winter were past, they left from there and arrived at a church which had been constructed in the name of Our Lady Mary, which was a place of gathering (?) of all travelers.</p>
<p>He who went away from there and he who stayed were known.</p>
<p>The holy men, when they arrived in this place, heard a voice saying, “Return to your monastery, because the supplication of your abbot and your brothers reached the ear of the God of armies. Your glory in the skies will not be inferior to the grandeur of the glory of pilgrims.”</p>
<p>Because of these words, they returned to their city [ville], saying, “May the will of God come to be.”</p>
<p>When they were close to arriving in their city, having a stage [étape] of a single day, they arrived in a large wadi close to their city. While they had passed a little beyond the course of water of this wadi following the road of their city, a terrible serpent came out from the midst of the stones and bit one among them.</p>
<p>The venom of the serpent spread in him, into his members; seeing that, his companions were frightened and shed abundant and bitter tears.</p>
<p>They said to him, “Let us make for you a remedy, our brother and friend, before your soul may depart.”</p>
<p>When the brother heard this word of remedy by the voice of his brothers, he admonished them. </p>
<p>He said to them, “Like a dog, do we return to our vomit and again, like a sow, do we go return to a mountain of mud after we are washed ?”</p>
<p>He said to them again, “My brothers, the useful remedy and salutary medicine, ask for them for me to God the Almighty and his mother, the Twice-Virgin Maru Mother of God.”</p>
<p>After that, they lifted the brother from there where he had fallen and transported him, having laid him down in the manner of a cadaver. They brought him to a church close to their road and made him enter the courtyard.</p>
<p>Having sat down to his right and to his left, they began to cry. When the brother heard their tears, he took the word and said to them, “What could your tears accomplish here for me? Leave me instead here and enter, you, into the church, because I hear the consecration of the Eucharist. Pray for me before the body and blood of Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and before the icon of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary.”</p>
<p>After the brothers went into the church to pray for him during Mass, that brother, while he had been tormented by the bite of the venom of the serpent, began to be truly sick, lying down and in a doze. He began and set himself to recite the salutations of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary. </p>
<p>He prayed and said, “Greetings, greetings to all your portraits, mother of God, my mother, my Lady Mary!”</p>
<p>He arrived there where it is said, “Among the children of men, there is no one who will be like you, Mary virgin of mind and virgin of body; blessed of your hand the sheep of the Gospel your people.”</p>
<p>Once he finished this prayer, Our Lady Mary came beside him and said to him, “My friend Untel, behold that I have come beside you when you called me of a love burning from the bottom of your heart. I arrive thus quickly, in haste, towards those quo call me with a faith coming from the heart of their thoughts.”</p>
<p>Having said that, with her fingers she touched the brother there where he had been bitten by the hooks of the serpent: at once, he was cured of all his ills.</p>
<p>Our Lady said to him, “Rise quickly and go beside your brothers in the church, because they are crying on their feet before my icon. From now on, do not have fear in this world, nor in the world to come, because you will be with me in the kingdom of the skies, with these brothers of yours.”</p>
<p>He rose then and prostrated himself before Our Lady. She [celle-ci] ascended to the skies in a grand glory.</p>
<p>Having arrived beside his brothers, he told them everything, to the point where Our Lady Mary had spoken to him about himself and concerning his brothers.</p>
<p>Having heard that, these holy men celebrated God, the celebrated and glorious, and lauded Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary.</p>
<p>They added beautiful acts to the preceding ones and returned to their monastery. The sound of their virtue was heard in many countries. Their death of all three was like the death of martyrs: the same day.</p>
<p>In the same way that they had been united in this world, likewise they were so in the kingdom of the skies by the intercession of Our Lady Mary, receptacle of requests and treasure of all good men [tous les biens]. [Translation as of 05/21/22]</p>

And all the holy men laughed at him and made a mock of him in the matter of intercourse with women; now he was a chaste man and had never touched the impure thing. And one day they all gathered together, and they talked as Satan made them, and they reviled him according to their wont. And they said unto him, ""O abbot, we will ask thee one question; thou must answer it."" And he said unto them, ""If ye will ask the question I will answer you""; and they said unto him, ""Father, hast thou ever sinned?"" And the abbot said unto them, ""Who hath moved you? Or perhaps Satan is speaking in your mouths. Be patient, and depart not from the Law."" And they said unto him, ""We have not seen thee, but it hath been told unto us that thou hast had intercourse with a woman."" And the abbot rose up and went into the sacrarium weeping and crying bitterly, and he prayed to God and to our Lady Mary, saying, ""O thou who art full of grace, remove from me disgrace and the corruption of this world; save me, and make me to rest from the mouth of the holy men."" And as he was praying and saying this our Lady Mary came to him at the ninth hour in the sacrarium. And she said unto them, ""O ye holy men, why do ye sin? Why hath the love of the Enemy entered your hearts, and why do ye teach abuse? Ye shall be a laughing-stock for ever.""

<p>There was a church which had been constructed in the name of Our Lady Mary. Many sick and suffering people were cured when they arrived early in the morning at this church.</p>
<p>There was a woman whose husband was taken by a prostitute, she was always sad and lamenting because of the prostitute who took and pleasured her man.</p>
<p>One day, when she encountered the prostitute on the street, she challenged her by saying, “You are a prostitute and an evil woman who took my husband and took the joy from the days of my life.”</p>
<p>When the prostitute woman heard the other’s challenge, she gave her assurances by saying, “I have not approached your husband in carnal union.”</p>
<p>The afflicted woman responded in turn and said to the prostitute, “I say to you, I am sure of it, that you took my husband from me, and the fruit that is in your belly is my husband’s.”</p>
<p>The prostitute said to her, “No, and this fruit of mine is not your husband’s.”</p>
<p>The other woman said again, “I make an oath before the altar of my Lady Mary by saying, ‘May my Lady Mary show a miracle of hers by me if I have lied about you (in saying that you are pregnant) without having approached my husband.”</p>
<p>The prostitute said to her, “I accept these words with the oath that you, you have said to me.”</p>
<p>This sinner-woman thus swore, by fear of saying her sin and by fear of revealing her fault, “May my Lady Mary make a miracle against me if I approached your husband in carnal union.”</p>
<p>Because of these words, this woman gave birth to four horns [cornes], all full of worms and blemishes – two bull horns and two ram horns – in great pains and many torments, crying and screaming.</p>
<p>While she was lying down [couchée], saying to all the strangers and people, “See what my Lady Mary has done to me,” this woman who had sworn died, having become mad and lost reason.</p>
<p>The four horns are in the windows of the church of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary mother of God.</p>
<p>Those who saw the miracle were greatly amazed, and also the king with his people and the metropolitan (bishop) with his prelates.</p>
<p>As for this king of upright faith, he constructed this sanctuary with precious stones.</p>

<p>        While he was in the days of his childhood, he learned the psalms of David beside a spiritual father, tied with the children of the rich.</p>
<p>        He finished the apprenticeship of the psalms of David, of the written and the apostles, of the Acts of the Apostles and of the writings of Paul.</p>
<p>        After that, his master refused him (any more [davantage]), saying, “Give me my salary.”</p>
<p>        The student gave his salary in proportion to that which was possible; his father, indeed, was poor in the goods of this world..</p>
<p>        As for the children of the rich, they learned of all the books of the Old and the New (Testament) in proportion to that which they could absorb. Just as the riches of their parents were abundant, and abundant too were the words of their instruction.</p>
<p>        When this monk saw that they prevailed over him in the familiarity with the Scriptures and in the execution of the chant of Yared , he cried and lamented.</p>
<p>        He said, “If my father were rich in the goods of this world, I too would be versed in the word of the Scriptures like these children of the rich. What to do then, and what to say? Beside whom to cry and to beg? Who will console my distressed and saddened soul? By the lack of goods, I am prevented from acquiring instruction! Now, I will go pray and beg my Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary mother of God, because she liberates the unhappy, consoles the afflicted and lightens (the burden of) him upon whom It weighs.”</p>
<p>        Having said that, the monk rose and went into the church of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary mother of God. He stood facing the altar, uncovered [découvrit; discovered] the icon of Our Lady and prostrated himself numerous times, to the point where his sweat became like clots of blood  while he was mangling his body.</p>
<p>        He made this a habit day and night. He ceased to eat and to pronounce a word with anyone, besides the confession to his master.</p>
<p>        He did not taste anything besides the Eucharist. As for water, he would take it with a sole hand, a half of a palm, in the vase that washed the hands of priests.</p>
<p>        He began fasting and prayer with a harsh labor, to the point where the skin of his stomach adhered to the bones of his sides.</p>
<p>        Because of this affair, when she saw the great vigils and the efforts of this monk, Our Lady went beside him openly with two archangels, bringing two goblets [coupes; cups] the color of gold, which (were) full of the beverage of intelligence and knowledge.</p>
<p>        When the monk saw Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, he trembled, was afraid and fell upon his face on the ground. Our Lady commanded then to the angels to lift up the monk.</p>
<p>        She said to the monk, “Do not be afraid, my friend, and do not tremble, because I have come beside you when you have called me with a love that burns from the bottom of your heart. I have come beside you for mercy and not for anger. I have come beside you for blessing and not for curse. Indeed, I have come beside you for honor and not for shame. Now, my friend, ask of me all that you wish and that which your heart will think: I will make and accomplish for you all your wishes.”</p>
<p>        When he heard openly these words of joy and enthusiasm from the mouth of Our Lady Mary, the monk prostrated himself and reveled.</p>
<p>        He opened his mouth and told Our Lady all his wishes and his thoughts, how he would seek knowledge and how his master had refused to teach him the Scriptures because of the poverty of his father and his lack of goods.</p>
<p>        The Blessed One responded to him and said to him, “Why, my friend, do you have this thought: to augment the glorifications and seek a great knowledge? Are not a righteous faith and good actions better?”</p>
<p>        The monk responded and said to Our Lady, “If you are not pleased with me, O Blessed One, and you are here to visit your servant – me, sinner and astray -- , could you make for me the will of my heart, o you whose thoughts are tender! Water me with your full cup of that which does not run dry, because you are the one who waters those who believe in you. These are Yared the priest, George [Georges] the monk  and others too who have found beside you the beverage of knowledge and the spirit of intelligence, so well that they saw the mystery of the sky, adorned with the purity of the angels while they were beings of dust.”</p>
<p>        Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, responded to the monk and said to him, “The cup which you have recalled that they had drunk from long ago, is the one which is in the hands of the archangels. While the portion of those there, which were drunk long ago, were to augment their knowledge and understanding of the Scriptures and exegesis, your part is not like theirs; but on the other hand, this (ascetic) struggle [combat] that you have undertaken, it is profitable to you since you began it with firmness (and it will stay) until you have finished it.</p>
<p>        “It will make you a friend with my Son, his Father and the Holy Spirit. Of me too, you will be the friend and faithful if you cease to drink from this cup. Behold that I have spoken to you so that you know well all that is suitable and profitable to you.”</p>
<p>        The monk responded again to Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, and said to her, “My will and my wish is to drink from this cup that will give me the understanding of your praise, o my Lady, and to multiply your glorifications in this world.”</p>
<p>        The Blessed One responded to the monk and said to him, “Why praises from your part? Do you not know that I, I am praised by the east of the sun to the west, and from the north to south by the mouth of angels and of men? Thereby am I praised and glorified at all times and all hours, day and night, upon the stretches of the earth and in the sky. As for you, I love for you this life of solitude, these trials and this retirement far from the people of the century, and the recitation of the psalms of my father David, the prayer of the gospel of my Son and the salutation of my angel. I authorize for you this (ascetic) struggle that you have commenced.” garbled</p>
<p>        Having heard this word from the mouth of Our Lady Mary, the monk rejoiced and reveled; he said, “May it be as you have said to me.”</p>
<p>        After those words, Our Lady blessed the monk, embraced him in her breast, kissed him upon his lips and, of her breasts, suckled him with an eloquent and blessed milk.</p>
<p>        She said to him, “My Christian son, I will not draw away from you until I have removed you from this transitory world.”</p>
<p>        The monk stayed to serve Our Lady in his life of solitude, through long days.</p>
<p>        Then he died in honor and in glory.</p>
<p>        Our Lady gathered his pure soul according to her promise and the grandeur of her generosity and placed it with her in the kingdom of the skies.</p>
<p>        All that came to be by the intercession of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary mother of God.[Translation as of 05/21/22]</p>

332,The new tabot of Saint Mary that was found outside the box in which it had been placed.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed,"<p>        This is a miracle, made by Our Lady Mary in the days of a king, her friend, and also a friend of her Son Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>        There </p>
<p>, strictly speaking, a shelf, generwas in the palace of the king an altar which was inscribed [engraved; inscrit] in the name of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, that one had placed in the interior of a chest before consecrating it.</p>
<p>        Next, one found it taken out of [sorti de] the interior of the chest, without the locking of the bolt of the chest being opened, placed upon a clothing [blanket; vêtement] of silk.</p>
<p>        Seeing that, the guardians of the treasures of the king trembled strongly; they went in haste and narrated to the king that which had come, concerning that altar.</p>
<p>        The king said to them, “Bring and show me this altar of whose splendor you have told me.”</p>
<p>        They brought it to him.</p>
<p>        When the king saw the beauty of the altar, he was amazed and rejoiced. Immediately, at once, he sent it to the archbishop [métropolite]  with numerous archpriests, priests and deacons, so that he would consecrate it.</p>
<p>        The altar was consecrated by the hands of the glorious father, the archbishop [métropolite] of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>        One brought it back in honor and glory, with numerous hymns.</p>
<p>        One announced to the king the coming of the altar. Immediately he went out to welcome the altar among the plentiful ovations, the sound of horns, trumpets and zithers, the voice of lyres and harps, the rolling of drums.</p>
<p>        Beautifully, he prepared for it an abode: he planted a somber tent of scarlet (?) and made it enter so that it would dwell there.</p>
<p>        When it was the next day, that somber tent had become white like snow.</p>
<p>        One told the king of this miracle of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary mother of God.</p>
<p>        The king gave, as gifts, many things that were necessary for the installation of the church. For the church, he also set up many servants who sounded trumpets. For the church, he also instituted priests and deacons who would minister, each in his time, night and day.</p>
<p>        After the king, friend of the church, made and finished all this, they commenced, each according to his duty, the servants sounding trumpets and the priests singing hymns with fierceness and with pride, with pleasantries [banter/jokes; plaisanteries] and multiplying laughter as they would do habitually in the other churches.</p>
<p>        And so, Our Lady Mary was irritated with them.</p>
<p>        The throat of certain ones among them closed, certain ones suffered in the head, certain ones were ill in their entrails.</p>
<p>        All suffered, each of his malady.</p>
<p>        Our Lady appeared also to the king and said to him, “Do not make these arrogant and proud people approach me, because their singing and their glorification do not please me, according to that which my father David said: Only by the unctuousness of sinners, may my head be anointed .”</p>
<p>        After hearing these words from the mouth of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, (the king) ordered that no one enter in the enclosure of that place but pure priests, at the moment of offering the Eucharistic sacrifice.</p>
<p>        He placed the altar close to him and, at the moment where sadness and affliction touched him, he would pray  close to it and obtain that which he had thought of and that which he had wished.</p>
<p>        He named it for [l’appela du nom] Mary the Solitary One.</p>
<p>        This altar is in the royal palace to this day, the kings multiplying for it, each in his epoch, grandeur and honor. To this day, no one enters nor approaches it who has the stain of a fault or the blemish of an evil thought.</p>
<p>        As for those who approach it with irreverence and human turpitude, they fall into a great malady to the point of saying, “Woe to us, woe to us!”</p>
<p>        They say, “This calamity has attained us by our irreference: we know well that we have been destroyed by the fear [crainte] (inherent to) the human person.”</p>
<p>        Listen thus, you, the assembly of the holy Church.</p>
<p>        Do not institute the habit of entering the church without purification or confession, because they are vigilant and pure, the angels who guard the church continuously.</p>
<p>        They avenge the church of anyone who approaches it in the filth of sin, because her [son] celestial betrothed made her a promise by saying, “If there are sullied ones there who are not pure, may they be moved aside.”</p>
<p>        This is not only in the case of the sexual stain that God commanded to be removed from the church, but the slanderous and the murderer (must) also go away.</p>
<p>        May anyone who has placed prosecution and desire for vengeance in his heart not enter there, for that would be a great fault.</p>
<p>        As for you who are here to hear of the miracle of Our Lady Mary, the mother of our Lord, men and women, old and young, each according to your names, may God place her [son] fear [crainte] into your body/bodies [corps].</p>
<p>        May it be with you during the day; may it be among you during the night.</p>

333,"A monk, while guarding a church, has a nocturnal emission and finds himself suddenly outside the courtyard of the church.",Africa Ethiopia confirmed,"<p>Now listen to the prodigious and wondrous greatness of the miracle of Our Lady Mary, which was done in the days of a king who was a friend of her and a friend of her Son, Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>In the greatness of his love for Our Lady, this king constructed for her a church – in the name of Mary blessed and pure, Mother of God – and adorned it with gold, silver, and fine, precious clothing.</p>
<p>He appointed also for her many priests and deacons who did the service there, night and day, with the recitation of the Psalms of David, with the chant of Yared, and with the Book of Hours of the blessed George.</p>
<p>Because of these great goods of the church that the king had given at the altar of Mary, no one entered the church who did not know the king and who was not known by the ministers of the church.</p>
<p>The priests of the church did not leave it, neither night nor day, guarding it in turns.</p>
<p>One day, while the priests were on guard all through the night, sleeping in the interior of the wall [enceinte] of the church, one among them had a nocturnal dream and the seed of his body spread upon his bed.</p>
<p>While the man who had dreamed was asleep among his companions, an angel of God took this man from the church, with neither himself nor his companions knowing; he made leave, without waking him from his sleep, this man who had dreamed. He made him (continue to) dream, having made him leave to the exterior of the wall of the church.</p>
<p>He took him to a distance of 24 cubits away from the wall of the church and the man stayed there until morning came, without being woken from his sleep.</p>
<p>When he woke, at the moment of morning, the man looked high and low and did not know what had happened to him and who had made him leave to this place.</p>
<p>As for those who had slept with him, they held among them slanderous words and said to each other, “Where has our companion gone for the whole night, without our knowing, having abandoned the guard of the king’s altar?”</p>
<p>Having risen from his bed, the man called his companions and said to them, “See where I stayed, I do not know who made me leave the interior of the wall and who took me from among you.”</p>
<p>His companions responded to him and said to him, “What happened to you because of the bad actions upon your bed? ”</p>
<p>He said to them, “I dreamed in my sleep; at the moment when I was dreaming, I was not conscious of it; but when I woke from my sleep there where he who separated me from you laid me down, at the moment, I found the sign of the dream in my flesh.”</p>
<p>When they heard the speech of the man, they took him and led him to the archpriests.</p>
<p>An archpriest questioned the man and the man told him all as it had happened.</p>
<p>Then the archpriest led him and made him stand before the king’s tribunal. He made a speech to the king’s advisers so that they might inform the king.</p>
<p>Having heard this affair, the king wondered and was astonished.</p>
<p>He gave thanks to Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, for having done for him this miracle, during his days.</p>
<p>Immediately a herald came from beside the king and beside the Metropolite, saying, “If someone from among the priests, deacons, and monks, or from among the laypeople enters the wall of a holy church, in the whole of our towns where God gave us power, while he is polluted by a nocturnal dream, may he be anathematized by the word of our fathers the apostles.”</p>
<p>Previously, no one who experienced a nocturnal dream had kept himself from entering a church; this only happened one day, when there appeared the miracle of Our Lady Mary upon this man.</p>
<p>After this event, the king and the Metropolite went together into the church that had been constructed in the name of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, Mother of God, and offered the sacrifice.</p>
<p>They gave many gifts because of this miracle that had been done for them by Our Lady during their days and served her finely.</p>

335,The Ethiopian general who went off to fight the Muslims without the consent of the king.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed,"<p>There was a governor and general of the king [an emissary of the strength of the king] who went into a battle with the Elwan/evil ones/heretical without the consent of the king and those evil ones overpowered this governor. </p>
<p>And there was with this governor, the tabot of Our Lady Mary, because he had the order from his forefathers [to have it in battle]. When it was the time to go into battles, he would never leave the tabot of Our Lady Mary behind. And as for the priests ordained to the governor, they were following him with the tabot.  </p>
<p>And on that day when he went into battle without the permission of the king and with an arrogant heart, then that wicked day surprised him. Those evil ones conquered the governor along with his soldiers. And so the Arami/Muslims/Pagan captured the tabot. </p>
<p>So, when one among the evil ones, whom the snare of Satan had seized, saw that tabot of Our Lady Mary, he said to his evil companions,“Behold, look at this tablet of the Christian worshippers!”   </p>
<p>And having said this, he arose with the wrath of Satan and that evil one sat on top of the tabot. Immediately, it tore him and split him into two parts.And his entire being was like his flesh had been cooked in a red hot copper cauldron.  </p>
<p>And when the Arami/Muslims/Pagan saw this miracle of Our Lady the-fold Holy Virgin Mary, [that is,] the Tabot of the Holy Spirit, Maryam, which in Hebrew is Mariham, there was some of them who believed, but there were some among them who fled lest they should see the tabot. </p>
<p>And after these happenings, they returned the tabot of Mary Mariham to her town with honor and praise. May her prayers, intercessions, and blessings be with all of us forever and ever. [Translation as of 05/21/22]</p>

And also [that second woman] left him and she committed adultery with another man. And then a terrible jealousy entered into his heart and he took fire and he got up and he went and burnt the house of that woman in his jealousy. And [those] two people [the woman and husband??] died in that fire.  </p>
<p>And when the people of the town heard, they held a meeting and investigated while saying, “Who is the one who did this great crime and sin?” And all the people of the town truthfully denied it and said “far be it from us [to do this]” and “we did not do this.” And they said amongst themselves “come let us and go to the church to the Virgin Mary, two-fold, the ark of the holy spirit, Mariham, which is in Hebrew Mariham, let us swear all of us so that she can reveal with her miraculous might the one who did this evil.” And all of them entered and swore saying, “If we have done this crime, let Mary reveal her might and a miracle against us?” And also, that man who had done this, pledged a more amazing pledge that was greater than all of the rest. And to this man who swore in falsehood, his [first] wife became pregnant. And when the day of her child-bearing drew near, she gave birth for him two dogs and a child. And as for those dogs, that first wife hid [and buried] them in the muck of a field. And our Lady Mary appeared to yet another woman in a vision of the night, and she said to her that “because the wife of so-and-so [the arsonist] has hidden my sign, [go and] tell the people of the town and you will find in that place the sign, which is not false. [secondary hand for “which is not false”] And dig and bring out from within the muck those dogs.” Ahd she got up from her slumber and she told the people of the town and they went and dug and found the two dogs in the muck, just as our Lady Mary instructed. And they brought out those dogs and they carried them in a basket. And when that man heard this sign, fear and trembling entered into his heart and he came with his wife to the assembly of the people, saying “I am the one who begat those dogs because I vowed in falseness in the church of our Lady Mary, two fold, the ark of the holy spirit, Mary, which is in Hebrew Mariham.” And all the people marvelled because of this sign. And this report was heard in all of the regions until it was heard in the ear of the king and the king having heard, marvelled and was amazed by the sign of our Lady, the holy Virgin two-fold, Mary, in Hebrew Mariham. Immediately, he commanded that they bring that man to him. At that time, the messengers of the king seized him and they were bringing him and while they were bringing him on the road, the eyes of the messengers of the king went dark and one of them slept a little while. And our Lady Mary appeared to the one who slept and she said to him, “Leave this man! Having seized him, don’t take him to the king. If you do this, your eyes will be opened.” And that messenger of the king arose from his slumber and he told his companions how he saw our Lady Mary in his dream and how she commanded him to leave that man. And immediately they abandoned him, and he returned to his home. And after that man had returned, our Lady commanded him to slaughter three cows in the three gates of the church and he did just as our Lady Mary commanded him. She forgave him his sins. And then he died/rested and entered into the kingdom of heaven by the intercession of our Lady Mary the compassionate.

And then, another woman arose next to his house and burned his house down with fire. But, it seemed to that man that his wife had burned his house down. And he made the wife swear by the name of Our Lady Mary. And after this he seized the people of the town and also that woman who had burned down his house. He had seized them [arested them] by the mighty word of the judge and he took them to the church of the Our Lady Virgin Mary… ark of the holy spirit, which is in Hebrew…, and made them swear before her icon. And that woman swore falsely, with deception, and without fear. That woman became pregnant, and at the time of her childbearing, she gave birth to one sheep and one goat and one person.  And she concealed the sheep and the goat in the land. But the goat cried out and howled while he was concealed in the ground  And the people of the city came and marvelled, “What is this sign which we hear within the heart of the ground and they dug in the ground and they found one sheep and one goat. And at that time, that woman came and told them how she swore falsely, at the icon of Our Lady Mary and how she gave birth to them and they marvelled at the might of Our Lady, holy Virgin, ark of the holy spirit, in hebrew… And as far as that woman, she remained going around all the towns and preaching her great miracle up until her death. May the prayer of our Lady Mary be with all of us, amen.</p>

341,The thieves who stole the furnishings of a church of Saint Mary and refused to restore them when she appeared to them.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed,"<p>One day among days, on a Sunday night, thieves entered a church of Our Lady Mary, breaking the doors and taking all the sacred vases.</p>
<p>As they were leaving, the guardian of the church said to them, “May what you have taken not seem to you the goods of men or the goods of the governor, but these are the goods of Our Lady Mary. Do not commit this theft, for it will not result in anything good for you.”</p>
<p>When he had said this to them, they struck him with great blows, injured him, and left, boasting in the arrogance of their heart.</p>
<p>As they were on their way, suddenly, Our Lady Mary appeared to them, dressed in clothing the color of lightning, at which it was impossible to gaze and which delighted the eyes. She said to them, “Where are you taking my goods? Leave them and return them, for you will not receive anything good. If you refuse, I will make retribution and calamity come upon you.”</p>
<p>They refused and advanced a little.</p>
<p>Our Lady appeared to them openly again and spoke to them as before; they refused (again) .</p>
<p>She appeared to them a third time and spoke to them with irritation and great anger. They did not listen to her word and went on their way.</p>
<p>When they were tired on the way, they sat down to eat and drink. But the head of the thieves, when he wanted to eat, had a closed throat and could not swallow.</p>
<p>Then (his companions) brought him water, having drawn it with a goblet from the church, so that he might drink.</p>
<p>When he raised the goblet, his hand became hard as stone and he could not bring the goblet to his mouth. As for his neck, it was twisted and turned around toward his back.</p>
<p>As the thieves were in such a situation, Our Lady Mary went in haste to the house of the governor, having assumed the guise of a widow. She appeared to him in a vision that night and woke him.</p>
<p>The governor was afraid, trembled, and said to her, “Where do you come from? In this town, I have (never) seen someone that looks like you.”</p>
<p>Our Lady Mary said to him, “My town is Wâdâ and I have come to you so that you might do for me what I desire.”</p>
<p>The governor responded and said to her, “What is it, then, that you desire?”</p>
<p>She said to him, “So it is that tomorrow, they will bring you my goods. Do not bring my goods into your house, but place them together with the goods of the church.</p>
<p>“Remember this.” [Garde-toi; idiomatic with flexible meanings]</p>
<p>Having said this, she disappeared from his sight.</p>
<p>The next day, the robbers arrived before the governor and gave him the goods of the church, just as Our Lady had said to him.</p>
<p>The governor, having forgotten what Our Lady Mary had said to him in the vision, welcomed the robbers with joy and gave them food, drink, and a sheep.</p>
<p>After this, Our Lady Mary appeared to the minister of the governor, who was loved and honored by him, and said to him, “Say to your master: ‘Why have you forgotten me, I who appeared to you in a vision concerning my goods? Now, if you do not act as I ordered you - do not welcome these robbers - I will enact my vengeance upon you.’”</p>
<p>Immediately, the minister of the governor rose and told his master how Our Lady had spoken to him.</p>
<p>Having heard, the governor was afraid and trembled. He understood the vision that Our Lady Mary had made him see, he immediately seized the robbers and imprisoned them.</p>
<p>These told the governor all that had happened.</p>
<p>After this, he sent a messenger to the church so that they might fetch the head [of the church].</p>
<p>When they had delivered to him the governor’s message, the head of the church rose and arrived before him.</p>
<p>The governor told him how Our Lady Mary had spoken to him, how she had said to him, “Place my goods with the goods of the church”, and how also he had forgotten.</p>
<p>Having heard this, the head of the church wondered and was astounded by the miracle of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, Mother of God.</p>
<p>So the governor sent to the people of Wâdâ someone who would tell them how the goods of their church had been found.</p>
<p>Having heard this message, all the people of the town of Wâdâ came, from eldest to youngest, Christians and Muslims, in joy and jubilation, wondering and admiring.</p>
<p>When they had arrived before him, the governor told them what he had seen from beginning to end.</p>
<p>Then the governor gave all the goods of their church to the people of Wâdâ. They went in peace, praising God and praising Our Lady Mary, the doer of miracles and wonders.</p>
<p>As for the robbers, some among them became mutes, some became mad and perished, and the governor put out the eyes of the others.</p>
<p>All died in such a way.</p>
<p>END PRAYER: </p>
<p>May her prayer and benediction be with us all who are assembled here to hear the miracle of Our Lady.</p>
<p>May, as of these robbers, she enact vengeance upon those who attack us, for ever and ever, amen. [Translation as of 05/21/22]</p>

349,The Ethiopian pilgrim who was expelled from the Church (of the Resurrection) in Jerusalem during the Easter services.,,"<p>Now listen to the wondrous, astonishing virtue of the miracle of Our Lady Mary, Mother of God, a miracle that she did in Jerusalem, the holy city of God.</p>
<p>In those days, when they committed persecution and murder against Christians, the pilgrims’ path was interrupted by the aggressions of destructive bandits.</p>
<p>So, on the day of the holy feast of Easter, during the descent of the light according to the accustomed institution, the pilgrims were missing.</p>
<p>There was no one to be found except for an Ethiopian pilgrim.</p>
<p>Then there assembled to celebrate the feast of Easter, each according to his ritual, the people of Persia, the people of Greece, and the people of Armenia, Syria, Georgia, and Alexandria with their bishops and their patriarchs.</p>
<p>It was a numerous assembly.</p>
<p>The people sought pilgrims among the Ethiopians and only found one.</p>
<p>They called him, made him stand in the middle of the assembly, and said, “What did you do, so that your Ethiopians companions are not here? What do you have (in common) with us, dazed face and shameful person!</p>
<p>“Now leave our assembly.”</p>
<p>Having said this, they put him outside, insulting and mocking him.</p>
<p>They spoke among themselves, saying, “Finally, we will see today the doctrine of the Ethiopians who boast over us!</p>
<p>“In fact, they boast, saying, ‘Without us, the people of Egypt could not (celebrate) the descent of the light of the resurrection.’”</p>
<p>Having said this, they chased and put outside the Ethiopian pilgrim.</p>
<p>The pilgrim thus left the middle of their assembly, exclaiming and lamenting with great tears.</p>
<p>He entered the Station of Mary and said to her, “O My Lady Mary, consider how I was insulted, scorned and chased from all this great assembly; is it not for the love of you and your Son that my pilgrimage took place in hunger and thirst, in sweat and fatigue?”</p>
<p>Having said this and similar words, he began to pray, standing in the Station of Our Lady Mary - which is Marihâm in Hebrew - , which is built opposite the Golgotha.</p>
<p>As for the reason for which they called this place Station of Our Lady, (it’s because) on the day Friday, as her Son was crucified on the wood of the Cross, Our Lady cried in this place. Because of this, they called this place Station of Our Lady Mary.</p>
<p>Whoever among the pilgrims who has an affliction or grief, when he implores and prays in this place, quickly receives the recompense of his prayer to Our Lady Mary.</p>
<p>Because of this fact, when the pilgrim was in this place in prayer and supplication, evoking his insult and his expulsion to Our Lady Mary, a light descended from the sky in this place for the pilgrim, insulted, chased and scorned from the assembly of many important people.</p>
<p>But as for him, his heart was raised to the sky, continuing to pray and supplicate Our Lady Mary. He did not see the luminous torch that burned on his hands.</p>
<p>But the Jews, seeing from far away the light burning on the hands of the pilgrim, were astonished, filled with wonder, and stunned.</p>
<p>They said, “Marvellous and right is the faith of the Ethiopians!</p>
<p>“See the insulted for whom a light descended from the sky!”</p>
<p>They called the pilgrim and said, “Don’t you see, man of God, this torch that burns on your holy hands?”</p>
<p>So the pilgrim regained his senses.</p>
<p>His affliction turned into joy and enthusiasm.</p>
<p>When he considered the power of the aid of Our Lady Mary, (manifested) by the descent of the light for him alone, because of his insult, he rejoiced.</p>
<p>Seeing this, the assembled people who had insulted and scorned the pilgrim were ashamed and troubled.</p>
<p>They said, “Truly, in truth, the faith of the Ethiopians is right and just!”</p>
<p>And so the assembled people went there where the light had descended and begged the pilgrim to pardon them for having insulted and scorned him.</p>
<p>He pardoned them.</p>
<p>Love and peace were between the pilgrim and the assembled people.</p>
<p>From that day, there was elevation and honor for the Ethiopians.</p>
<p>The (witnessed/demonstrated) favor by the Egyptians to the Ethiopians was great because of the descent of the light.</p>
<p>And the fact was quite certain that the light did not descend for the Egyptians where there were not Ethiopians of right faith.</p>
<p>These [Ethiopians?] love Our Lady Mary.</p>
<p>All this took place by the greatness of the miracle of Our Lady Mary.</p>
<p>And because of the insult (done) to this pilgrim.[Translation as of 05/21/22]</p>

350,"The icon of Saint Mary in the church of the ""Romans"" that rebuked the Ethiopians for approaching with their shoes on.",Africa Ethiopia probably,"<p>A marvel and miracle which Our Lady Mary made in holy Jerusalem, the country of the great King. </p>
<p>There was an effigy of Our Lady in the oratory of the Romans;  and all the Egyptians and Europeans and Alexandrians and Syrians and Galatians came near that effigy without loosening the shoes from the feet or lowering the veil from [their] head. </p>
<p>And the Ethiopians, seeing that the aforementioned entered and exited near that effigy with shod feet and a covered head, followed the bad habit of the Egyptians; and they entered with shoes near that effigy. </p>
<p>Therefore the heart of Our Lady Mary grieved and spoke openly from her effigy to the Ethiopian pilgrims saying to them: “Why have you taken up the wicked action  and bitter precept in the likeness of the Egyptians, to enter near my effigy with shoes on your feet, while I call you part of my Covenant and a portion of my Heritage,  given to me in you by My Son who said: ‘Look, I gave you the Ethiopians who celebrate your memory and are your sons and servants!’” </p>
<p>Speaking in such a way, she reproached the Ethiopians with the words of the effigy. And from that day on they left behind the custom of the Egyptians and they did not enter near that effigy with the shoes, that was the trait of pride.</p>
<p>It was that effigy in Jerusalem in the oratory of the Romans. There was no one from that day who entered with shoes, not even the Egyptians, the Romans and the Alexandrians, where there was the effigy of Our Lady the doubly-holy Virgin Mary, Mother of God, whose prayer and blessing is with us in the ages of the ages.  Amen.>></p>
<p></p>
<p>51.</p>
<p>Mount Zion and the Chapel of the Passing.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This second story therefore refers to the custom of entering into a sacred place of the Virgin in Jerusalem without shoes and without a headdress, a custom which was introduced for the first time by the Ethiopian  community.</p>
<p>What sacred place is it? The Ethiopic text speaks of << an effigy of Our Lady in the oratory of the Romans.  It seems probable to me that it is one of the localities sacred to the Virgin included in the Upper Room. The establishment of the Franciscan on Mount Zion, where the Custody of the Holy Land was based, was in fact the center of the Roman community; and an Arabic document of July 15, 1337 already calls it hawš al-Ifrang << the cloister of the Romans>>. The Upper Room, as it is known, included the chapel of the Transit of Mary, the most venerated place and which gave the name of Saint Mary of Zion to the whole sanctuary. The chapel, already adorned in the Byzantine era of marble and of mosaics, was then ruined in the Islamic era. Since the early days of the arrival of the Franciscans to Mount Zion the project to restore the chapel of the Transit had arisen; and, for example already Gregory IX in his note of March 1, 1373 had spoken about the idea of the Franciscans to repair the hospital (of Mount Zion)  << and it is alleged that in a contiguous place to the hospital itself in which the Most Blessed Virgin Mary the Mother of God often remained and stretched out and ascended into heaven, they founded and built a certain church or oratory….>>.  But the purpose was not able to be realized due to the opposition of the Muslims; and also, the other holy places related to the life of the Virgin, annexed to the Upper Room, were not able to be protected by dry stone walls; so that it is not at the place of the Transit to which our Ethiopian story could refer.</p>
<p>But at the southern edge of the building the place is found where, according to the tradition, <<holy John the disciple, said the mass to the Virgin Mary after the death of her dear Son>>;  while <<[the place] where the Virgin Mary stayed seven years is, returning to the door of the said church (of Zion), on the left side of the door attached to the wall. There is a room, long and wide like a cell of brothers and the Virgin dwelt there for seven years>>.  This news of Niccolò of Poggibonsi is confirmed, for the fifteenth century, by Faber who, in the view of Mount Zion came<< to the exterior corner of the church and there is the place in which the blessed Virgin Mary had her oratory. In that place therefore we prostrated ourselves and, praying, we accepted forgiveness>>.  The place, to which the Ethiopian story alludes, therefore may be the oratory of the Virgin or the location of the office of Saint John, both annexed to the Upper Room. It should be noted that the tradition of Saint John which, before the Transit, it communicates, officiating like a priest, the virgin and the Apostles is not only entered in Ethiopia, but is included in the same <<Miracles of Mary>> (manuscript Zot. 60 below the numbers 97 and 98).</p>
<p>It reports this topographical data, also for this story in the fifteenth century. Because the Franciscans held Mount Zion from 1335, the date of purchase, up to March 18, 1523, the date on which they were driven out by the Turks.[Translation as of 05/21/22]</p>

<p>There was a priest who loved Our Lady Mary with all his heart and with all his strength.</p>
<p>He performed [célébrait] only the liturgy of Our Lady Mary.</p>
<p>One day, during the feast of the Dormition of Our Lady, the 21st of the month of Terr, he began to perform the liturgy of Our Lady Mary, as was his custom.</p>
<p>Many people, rich and poor, were assembled there to celebrate the feast.</p>
<p>With them was a rich man who boasted of his great wealth and was proud of the solidity of his power.</p>
<p>When he heard the liturgy of Our Lady Mary from the mouth of the priest, who was saying, “My heart overflows with beautiful words and I know the liturgy of Mary,”  he said to the priest with a blasphemous word, “Overflows with blood!”</p>
<p>Having said this, he exited the church in the middle of the anaphora, on the day of the great feast, when misled in temptation by the enemy of good, the adversary of the human race. </p>

352,The rich persons who stored their wealth in a church.,,"<p>There was a church which had been constructed in the name of Our Lady Mary.</p>
<p>Many rich people and homeowners dwelled in this city. They were very rich in objects of gold, in money [argent] and in clothing stitched with precious gold.</p>
<p>As for that church, its construction was elegant – with stone of price and with (beams of) wood of the same (width ?). The sacred vases and the ornate clothing of festivals and Sundays were many, abundant and magnificent in this place.</p>
<p>The people put all their possessions below the crypt (?) in the interior of the sanctuary, below the vault.  The landed proprietors and the homeowners who dwelled in this city put together their finery in the interior of the sanctuary, joining them with the clothing of the church. </p>
<p>While many days had passed in such a way, Our Lady Mary spoke to a priest who believed in God and dwelled on the forecourt of the church.</p>
<p>She said to him, “Listen, my friend: I suffer a great torment because of these rich people and homeowners, because they put their property in the interior of my home. Now, having risen, go and tell them this commandment of mine: that they quickly remove their property from the interior of my home.”</p>
<p>Our Lady spoke of many days to this priest in saying this to him. </p>
<p>He himself, not neglecting the commandment of Our Lady, spoke to all the rich people and homeowners by saying, “Remove your property from the interior of the sanctuary, because Our Lady Marry is very irritated against you, as you put your property in the interior of the sanctuary.”</p>
<p>Having heard his words, the rich people and homeowners [they] opposed him with a refusal. No one amongst them yielded to his warning, because the spirit of the Enemy had troubled their heart.</p>
<p>When Our Lady Mary saw that they had hardened their heart, she felt a great anger, (to the point of wanting) to destroy the church while numerous people had been assembled in order to celebrate the Nativity of Our Lady Mary on the first day of the month of genbot – at the moment of the Eucharist, as the priest was distributing the holy mystery.</p>
<p>When he began to distribute it, first to a man to whom the grace of God had been imparted, a bolt of fire came suddenly from the sky and fell in front of the altar.</p>
<p>Seeing this, the assembled people were terrified and all escaped: priests, deacons, and believers. No one stayed, and no one found force in their faith with the exception of the priest and the deacon who were officiating at the time for the service of the holy mystery.</p>
<p>The assistant priest was also terrified, he doubted in his heart and said to his colleague, “Let us go and flee like all our companions before the bolt of fire consumes us.”</p>
<p>When his colleague heard this, he reprimanded him and said to him, “Is it correct for us to flee far from the table of God, as it is him who bestows death and life? He also makes one descend to sheol and makes one rise back up. Is He not the God who saved the three children from the inferno of the fire of Babylon ? And us, he will save us. Only, be strong and courageous, my brother, do not doubt; if we are enduring and strong in the presence of this celestial table, we will not have any more penalty in the skies. If we were to flee and, abandoning them, let this spiritual nourishment and divine cup be lost, God will collect us and make us pay on the Day of Judgement. Have you not heard that which the apostles said in their Sinodos ? ‘If it happens that a little of the body of Our Lord falls, and if it happens that a drop of the cup of his precious blood falls, know, priest, that it is you who has disowned, scorned, and fooled your creator.’”</p>
<p>When he made this entire reproach to the assistant priest [him], he terrified him. And he reassured the heart of his colleague.</p>
<p>After this speech, he commanded the deacon to say, “We praise Him.”</p>
<p>And so, the deacon cried out, as the bolt of fire blazed from all directions.</p>
<p>He said, “We praise God, having received his sanctity… ” up to the end.</p>
<p>Next the priest, with upright faith, took the rest and cried out with a great voice, standing in the middle of the fire.</p>
<p>He said, “I exalt you, my king and my God .”</p>
<p>Having finished that which was prescribed by the habitual rite, he entered in the interior of the sanctuary and held himself standing with his companions in the holiest of chancels [le saint des saints] . All three together glorified and recited psalms, standing in the middle of the fire, because Our Lady Mary guarded them and protected them so that the heat of the bolt of fire would not consume them. </p>
<p>Those who saw this miracle, these three men upon whom it was manifest as they were safe, said, “Since we entered in the interior of the sanctuary, our Lady to all, Mary the Virgin, did not withdraw from among us, encouraging us and saying to us, ‘Be courageous and do not have fear.’ We stayed in that way for seven days until all the embers of the fire cooled down. Seven days afterwards when the heat of the bolt of fire had cooled, the entire assembly of the church arrived beside us and found us in the midst of prayer. On us, there was no scent of fire . The fire touched a little in the middle of the beard of one amongst us, who was the assistant priest. It appeared there like a color of leprosy, because then, he had wanted to leave the church with the assembled people who had fled.”</p>
<p>Next, having exited, these priests, chosen and pure, reunited with the entire assembly of the church and said to these people, “While the order of Our Lady Mary was communicated to you, you refused to listen and, by your disobedience, the church burned. And if Our Lady Mary had not guarded us, we too would have perished. But she showed upon us her miracles and her wonders. Indeed, Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary Mother of God, did not separate from us until you, you would appear before us.”</p>
<p>Having said that, they said to the assembly [them] again, “From now on, we will not reside with you. But we will go to the city of Mary which is Jerusalem.”</p>
<p>Having exited from the sanctuary, without even entering their homes, they left for Jerusalem.[Translation as of 05/21/22]</p>

May her intercession be with her beloved [Habtä lyyäsus] forever. Amen. Listen to a miracle of Mary. There was a merchant in the land of the Agcazi (= Ethipia) who feared God and who greatly loved Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin, the Ark of the Holy Spirit, Mary, Mariham. One day he purchased a slave from the market of Damot for a little money and went off to make a profit in the market of Bärara, on a Thursday. But the slave escaped from his master in the midst of the market and went off with another man on a long journey. When his master missed him, he toured the markets once, twice and a third time in search of his slave but he could not find any trace of him wherever he went. Now, when this good man lost his slave, he bought a small amount of incense and three candles and hurried to a church which was built in the name of Our Lady Mary saying thus (to himself): ""The power of My Lady Mary's assistance is better for me than the assistance of men."" While the man was walking in the street carrying the incense and the candles, he met Our Lady Mary in the likeness of a noble lady (f. 208v) with two handsome young men standing on her right and left sides. She addressed him saying, ""0 man, where are you going? From where did you set out to arrive here?"" He spoke to her and informed her of all the grief and sorrow that had befallen him in connection with the loss of his slave in the market of Bärara. She further addressed him saying, ""So where are you going now to find your slave that escaped from you?"" He answered her saying, ""I am going to that church which is built in the name of Our Lady Mary with incense and candles to see the power of Our Lady Mary's assistance."" Our Lady responded saying to him, ""Show me the incense and the candles that you have brought."" He showed her the three candles and the small amount of incense. Taking the candles and the incense in her hands, she said to him, ""What is this bit of incense and (these) candles? Are you hoping for the assistance of Mary for the sake of this little offering?"" He said to her, ""If Our Lady Mary helps me in view of this little offering, I shall please her very much and serve her until (f. 209r) I depart from this world."" Having said this, he took the offering from the hands of Our Lady. She went ahead of him to the church with the two young men. Then she disappeared from him. Following behind her, the man entered the church holding the incense and the three candles. He gave them to the priest saying, ""With this incense and (these) candles intercede for me with the Virgin Mary, My Lady, about my slave who escaped from me in the market. If she shows in my regard her miraculous power by finding my slave, I shall celebrate her commemoration till the day of my death."" After he had told this matter to the priest, he, too, started praying and supplicating Our Lady Mary with fervent intension, that she might show him the power of her assistance by finding his slave that had escaped. When he had finished his prayer and come out of the church, he found his slave that had escaped standing outside the door of the church. He questioned him saying, ""Where have you been since you escaped from me? And who took you and brought you here?"" (f. 209v). The slave spoke to his master and said, ""After I escaped from you there came to me where I was living in a distant land, in the house of another man, a noble lady, young men, and she said to me, 'Rise up quickly and go to your master, praying and supplication in my church. Having said this, she disappeared me, her order brought me here although I did not know my way, and you see me, my master'."" When the master of the slave saw the power of the assistance and the miracle of Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin, the Ark of the Holy Spirit, Mariham in Hebrew, he donated the slave to be a servant in that church, the name of Mary, in cutting wood and fetching water for needs of the of his death. And the master of the slave lived on celebrating the commemoration Lady Mary, and so pleased God and departed from this (f. 210r) passing into the Kingdom of Heaven by the intercession of Our Lady Mary. May blessing be with her beloved [Habtä lyäsus] forever and ever. Amen, amen 0 my Lady Mary who is Mariham in Hebrew, the citrus rod of Aaron, and the horn of ointment of Samuel, the Prophet, as you appeared by your goodness to that slave and his master, so that they saw the light of your face and so that they heard your appear to me as (you did) to them and speak to me every day and every And bring it about that I be an invited (guest) with your elect when wedding feast of your Son to be bestowed upon and receive the reward of treasure for their praise,  your servant Tänsa'a Krastos who trust fully in you, forever and ever.

354,King Dawit miracles: The monasteries summon King (Dawit) of Ethiopia to abdicate.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed,"<p>So listen, you assembly of Christians, to the great marvel and the astonishing miracle that Our Lady Mary did upon a king, her servant who was loved by her Son.</p>
<p>And how she did for him numerous miracles and astonishing, astounding wonders that please the heart of those who listen and create surprise in the circle of assembled people.</p>
<p>This is the first of the miracles that Our Lady Mary did for this king.</p>
<p>When God placed him at the head of the kingdom of his fathers David and Solomon, he sent messengers in all the countries of his kingdom where there were holy men [saints], who in the mountains and the plains, in the islands and the caves, to (spiritually) combat in the fast and the prayer, clothed in a sack and wearing a constraint (?) , donning goatskin and sheep fleece. He hurried also to all the people of faith, saying this, “Listen, you the holy men of the Most high who received the mind/spirit of God which is not the mind/spirit of the age.</p>
<p>“In truth, it is about you that Our Lord and Savior said in the gospel of the kingdom, “Happy are the pure of heart, for they shall see God! </p>
<p>“Now, my blessed brothers, implore for me God Most High and my Lady, my crown of glory and my jewelry of grace, Mary the Virgin.</p>
<p>“This is my entreaty and my supplication so that God might make me stay on my royal throne for a long time, so that he might not hunt me in the middle of my years, so that he might not make my hope in vain, and so that he might give me always what I wish.”</p>
<p>It is all this and other similar words that the king sent to say there were the holy men were, in their caves and in their cells.</p>
<p>Having departed, the messengers of the king returned quickly after having arrived near the ascetics.</p>
<p>They reported to the king a terrible, terrifying news, those who (had gone) far like those who (had gone) nearby, those from the mountains like those from the islands.</p>
<p>Their words were in complete agreement, without divergence.</p>
<p>When the king heard the agreement of his messengers’ words from which none differed or diverged, he was stunned and astonished.</p>
<p>He quickly rose from his throne and prayed for a long time, which was his custom.</p>
<p>Having finished his prayer, he sent messengers with haste so that they might bring his general.</p>
<p>This was the leader of his advisers, who gave orders to the king’s officers in his place and directed his leaders, like him, with wisdom.</p>
<p>Having arrived, the king’s general bowed before his face.</p>
<p>When he saw the king despondent and worried, he trembled, was astonished and stayed quiet.</p>
<p>He was afraid to ask him a question and stayed lying on the ground.</p>
<p>So the king addressed his speech to his general and said to him, “Did you not hear that the messengers that we sent to the holy men have arrived?”</p>
<p>The general replied and said to him, “What news did they bring, my lord, for I see your clear and luminous face become dark and despondent?”</p>
<p>The king responded, “They delivered and reported to me a frightful and terrifying news that shakes the bones, slices the entrails, separates soul from body, and tears the tendons from the limbs.”</p>
<p>The king’s general responded, “Inform your servant exactly and tell him, lord, the news that reached you.”</p>
<p>The king responded, “This is the news that reached me from one single voice on the part of all the holy men: </p>
<p>“‘The days that you have lived on earth suffice.</p>
<p>“Only, put your house in order and entrust your kingdom to your son. Your departure from this world is near, thus says to you the Lord - Lord of armies is his name.’”</p>
<p>Having heard this, the king’s general responded, “May your heart not tremble, my lord, because of this affair. Only listen to your servant who has pondered an opinion in his heart.”</p>
<p>The king said to him “Speak, please, so that I might know in my heart if (your opinion) is good or bad for me.”</p>
<p>The general responded, “This is my opinion: let us say that we absolutely refuse this news that has come back to us.”</p>
<p>Having heard this opinion from his general, so the king hurried to his master the Guardian of Hours  whose name was Saraqa-Berhân and said, “Come, my master, for I have encountered something strange.”</p>
<p>When the Guardian of Hours Saraqa-Berhân had arrived, the king rose from his throne surrounding him with consideration and honoring him. He said, “Sit, my master.”</p>
<p>The Guardian of Hours said to the king, “What happened to you that you so called me?”</p>
<p>So the king told his master all the news that came back to him on the part of all the holy men, news of affliction and mourning, and also how his general had told him, “Let us absolutely refuse this news that reached us.”</p>
<p>Having heard the king’s story, his master grieved greatly.</p>
<p>He said also to the general, “Why did you say : Let us refuse the word of the living God who spoke by the mouth of the holy men who are timeless?”</p>
<p>The general responded, “I did not say : Let us refuse the word, by pride and by insolence, but simply knowing that God is merciful and mild, distanced from anger and rich in mercy and justice, He who [puts back? forgives?] [remet] sins and lightens burdens.</p>
<p>“He who gave to the king Hezekiah the length of his days. </p>
<p>“He who saved the people of Nineveh from destructive death. </p>
<p>“This is for this that I said: May the heart of my lord the king neither grow sad nor tremble.</p>
<p>“Only, let us implore and beg in tears and moans, like the lamentation of Hezekiah, donning a sack and (sitting) upon a bed of cinders, like the people of Nineveh, so that God might come back to us and be merciful to us.</p>
<p>“This is my opinion, I your servant, my lord.”</p>
<p>Having heard this, the master of the king said to the general, “Your opinion pleases me and your speech satisfies me.</p>
<p>“But it is fitting that we put your opinion in practice.” The king and his master agreed with this opinion.</p>
<p>The king rose from his throne and left his ceremony. He donned a sack and made himself a bed of cinders.</p>
<p>His master and his general made, like their lord, a great lamentation, donning a sack and sitting in the ash.</p>
<p>On the seventh day that the king lamented in this way, Our Lady Mary came near him in a great majesty, with numerous soldiers of heaven following her.</p>
<p>She said to the king, “Salutations to you, my friend and the friend of my Son; so I came near you when you invoked me with profound love and fervent thought.</p>
<p>“Because of what affair did you thus multiply lamentation and mourning, to the point that your prayer and your supplication were heard before me, my friend?”</p>
<p>The king put forward all the news that had come back to him on the part of all the holy men.</p>
<p>Our Lady Mary replied, “These holy men spoke truthfully, none among them lied.</p>
<p>“But when my Son considered your moans and your mourning - yours, that of your master and that of this your servant who desired and wished this vehemence lamentation and of mourning - , because of this, so the Lord your God showed himself merciful and mild toward you.</p>
<p>“As for your days, I begged my Son for you and He gave you a long duration (of life), so much so that you will see your children’s children. And the kingdom of heaven is prepared for you and for all those who will spring from your loins.</p>
<p>“This pact and this promise, I have them already for you close to my Son, close to His Father and close to the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>After having put forward this announcement to the king, Our Lady gave peace to him and climbed to the heavens in a great glory.[Translation as of 05/21/22]</p>

<p>Many people and priests resided there.</p>
<p>The guardian of this church was prideful and insolent, he did not carry out his service in purity.</p>
<p>During many days, the bishop admonished him, reprimanded him, and corrected him in the assembly.</p>
<p>But the prideful man did not listen to the word of the bishop and did not accept the reprimand, for his heart had been injured by the poison of the enemy of good.</p>
<p>While he was in such bad behavior, on the 27th of the fifth month, on the day of the great feast, Our Lady descended from heaven to bless the people assembled who were gathered to celebrate the feast.</p>
<p>She appeared to the bishop in a vision.</p>
<p>So she commanded that they make the bad and insolent guardian come.</p>
<p>The angels whipped him with a concealed hand, the bishop watching this through the eye of the spirit.</p>
<p>When it was morning, the bishop set off, trembling and frightened of the reprimanding word of Our Lady Mary that he had heard in the vision.</p>
<p>Having arrived there where the guardian was, he commanded that they make him [guardian] come before him [bishop].</p>
<p>When the envoys had gone there, they found the guardian lying like a corpse, fallen on his face.</p>
<p>Having entered there, the bishop questioned him about what had happened to him. The guardian told him of all the reprimanding torment that had affected him on the part of Our Lady Mary due to the fact that he had shown himself prideful about the church and with regard to all its priests.</p>
<p>He said to the bishop, “Listen/Mind, O master, to you Our Lady did not hide anything from you and she did not punish you like me. </p>
<p>“But because you reprimanded me and because you corrected me before the assembly; because, therefore, of this your virtue, Our Lady Mary has shown herself merciful and mild toward you.</p>
<p>“As for me, all this punishment happened to me because I transgressed your command and your admonishment, O master.”</p>
<p>When all the assembled members of the community of the church saw that the whole body of the guardian was colored black like a root that one had removed from a boiler/cauldron, they all cried and shed bitter sobs.</p>
<p>They spoke among themselves, saying, “May these reprimands and punishments of our brother bring us intelligence and knowledge.”</p>
<p>The doleful man spoke to the priests and the deacons, urging them, “Be careful, my brothers and my fathers, and do not be insolent and prideful of heart like me; do not officiate with disrespect during the proceedings of the holy mysteries, having seen the misfortune and punishment that affected me on the part of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary.</p>
<p>“On the contrary, beg and pray in my favor for the pardon of my sins.”</p>
<p>When he had said this to them with sorrowful sobs and bitter tears, his soul departed from his body.</p>
<p>When they saw the death of this man, many people and priests rejected the century; abandoned heritage, houses and position; and devoted themselves to God the Most High.</p>

He constantly read her praises and greetings, without interruption.</p>
<p>While this monk was acting in such a manner, a rich man invited him to celebrate the feast of the Assumption of Our Lady Mary on the 16th of Nahasê. The monk headed for the place where he had been invited.</p>
<p>While he was en route, he arrived at a great river. He wanted to cross, but the current of the river took him, for it was the time of the rainy season.</p>
<p>So he removed his clothes, placed them upon his head, and entered the water to cross.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a demon emerged from the river’s depths, touched the monk, and dragged him into the depths, trying to make him perish.</p>
<p>Then the monk lost hope of his life and was abandoned within the depths.</p>
<p>While he was in such grave danger, the poor monk recalled the help of Our Lady. He said to her, “Where has it gone, the pact that you received from your son Jesus Christ concerning he who commemorates you and invokes your name: he must not see destruction in this world nor in the world to come? </p>
<p>“Is it not in remembering your pact, my Lady, that I left on a journey in the time of the rainy season for the solemn feast of your Assumption, while my eyes were seeing and my heart well knowing that rivers with (violent) currents were on my route?</p>
<p>“O aid to those who are in danger and mountain of refuge for the oppressed, may your aid make itself seen upon me so that I recount and proclaim your justice by my greeting.</p>
<p>“May glory, honor, and adoration return to you from the mouths of all generations for ever and ever, amen.”</p>
<p>While he prayed thus, submerged  in the bosom of  the great river, Our Lady Mary came beside him and reprimanded the spirit of the demon who tormented the poor monk whom she loved.</p>
<p>She commanded the monk, saying to him, “Rise, stand upon your feet, and recite the book of my praises and my greetings, as is your custom.”</p>
<p>She showed him where to stand up within the river. He remained and stayed there, within the river, to recite the praises and the greetings of Mary without interruption until there arrived beside him all the people and priests who had learned of his submersion in the river.</p>
<p>Having arrived on the river bank, all the people and priests stopped and asked the monk’s disciple, who had followed his master, what he had seen when the river’s current had taken him [the monk], to the extent that he had been submerged within the river.</p>
<p>He [the disciple] showed them the path by which his master had entered the river and where he had been submerged, to the extent that he had disappeared from view.</p>
<p>Having entered the depths, the men who knew how to swim found the monk standing, reciting the praises of Our Lady Mary.</p>
<p>He delivered the praises there where it is said, “Mary the Virgin cried in the Temple, saying, ‘God knows that I know nothing else than the sound of the voice of the angel.’” </p>
<p>They found him reciting these words, standing. They made him get out onto the dry land. His clothes had not been moistened by the river’s current. All greeted him, amazed that he was alive and safe.</p>
<p>They questioned him about everything: how the danger of the river had touched him, how he had been invited to celebrate the feast of the Assumption of Our Lady Mary, and how Our Lady had visited him and saved him from the demonic spirit and the submersion in the river.</p>
<p>He said to them again, “It would have been better for me if you had not come beside me, for I would remain light of heart and surrounded by the grace of the majesty of Our Lady Mary.”</p>
<p>Then he went with his companions there where he had been invited for the feast and returned to his house. He devoted himself to God the Most High and finely promised to serve Our Lady Mary until he should die and leave this transitory world.[Translation as of 05/21/22]</p>

<p>There was a rich man who celebrated the feast of the Assumption of Our Lady Mary in the same way as the resurrection of her Son: by satiating the famished, giving water to the thirsty, and clothing those who were nude.</p>
<p>His story was heard in all the towns. There came by him, from distant regions, many sick men, poor men, men who were nude, who desired alms from the hands of this rich man.</p>
<p>After this, the rich man invited a priest to celebrate the feast.</p>
<p>This priest did not have eyes; he was born blind from his mother’s womb.</p>
<p>But the eyes of his heart were luminous; he taught many priests and deacons and made them understand the holy books of the Old and New (Testament).</p>
<p>Immediately, the priest came to celebrate the feast there where he had been invited, leading with him in his wake many young people to whom he was teaching the Psalms of the prophet David and the writings of the holy apostles.</p>
<p>The number of these adolescents was forty one.</p>
<p>One of these adolescents was good in his behavior and loved his master as himself, more than all his companions.</p>
<p>While they were on their way, they arrived at a great chasm that was in the middle of the road.</p>
<p>So the adolescents contemplated an evil plan against their master: they were going to throw him in the chasm.</p>
<p>The boy whose behavior was good begged his companions, saying, “My brothers, don’t do so evil an action against our master. How has he done you wrong?</p>
<p>“Did he not make us understand and taught us the voice of God? Therefore, do not do wrong against this elect man if you do not want God to hold you accountable for the blood of this just man.</p>
<p>“Will we not be named as Cain, the murderer of his brother, and as Judas the impious, seller of his master, husband of his mother and murderer of his father?</p>
<p>“And so too will we become like those children that were killed by the bear in the days of Elijah.” </p>
<p>While he made all these entreaties to them from the books of the Old and New (Testament), none turned to the words of the boy full of knowledge. Indeed, the poison of Satan, the adversary of the human race, had turned their heads and intoxicated them.</p>
<p>When the boy saw that they refused his entreaty and did not welcome his words, he separated himself from them and left them, saying, “Me, I am going in order to not join myself to your assembly of blood.”</p>
<p>Having said this, the boy, when he wanted to go, approached his master; he [boy] kissed [baisa] his [priest’s] mouth and, having kissed [embrassé] his neck, shed bitter tears, crying and lamenting vehemently.</p>
<p>He could not free nor save his master from the hands of his companions, for they outweighed him thanks to their number, and it was a deserted place.</p>
<p>Because of this, the boy went with haste, saying, “(I will see) if ever I find someone who will help me to carry the corpse of my master.” And he went quickly, crying and moaning, until he arrived at the place where his master had been invited and called on to celebrate the feast.</p>
<p>As for the evil adolescents, they did as they wanted and acted as they had contemplated. So they threw their master in the depths of the great chasm, of which one could not see the bottom and from which one could not get out.</p>
<p>As soon as they lowered and threw this just man in the depths of the chasm, this man placed his hope in the aid of Our Lady Mary.</p>
<p>While he recited, without interrupting his mouth,  the greeting of Gabriel, the priest was thrown in the chasm. Suddenly, at the same moment, came beside him in a great majesty the mother of the poor, sweet of thought; the liberator of those who are in danger, the support of those who stagger, Mary - Mârihám. She said to him, “Do not be afraid and do not tremble, my friend.</p>
<p>“Indeed, it is by love for me that you departed on your journey. I too, departed on my journey and came rapidly to help you when I noticed your dangers.</p>
<p>“In this way do I rapidly arrive, in the moment of their danger, beside those who love me with a valiant heart.”</p>
<p>And upon the wings of the angels who serve her, Our Lady rapidly took the priest, in the blink of an eye, to the place where he had been invited to celebrate the feast.</p>
<p>Our Lady herself was with him, but no one saw her except for him.</p>
<p>Having entered in this place that had been constructed in her name, there where they celebrated the assumption of her body, Our Lady Mary blessed the priest who had been mistreated at the hand of these evil dogs, sons of cruel vipers. She gave him a pact according to which he would be with her in the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p>She also blessed the rich man who celebrated the feast of her assumption.</p>
<p>All the people assembled whom the rich man had invited, Our Lady Mary blessed them.</p>
<p>As for the adolescent who had separated himself from the assembly of these evil dogs, she rewarded him with the grace to be associated with his master in the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p>As for the evil adolescents, she commanded the powerful Angel of Death to beat them with a lance of iron without sparing them; they perished and disappeared, all in only one day.

Indeed, my Son had decided upon the loss of this man, like the Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and like Herod, king of Galilee, when he recalled his many honored martyrs, whose names he wrote in the heavens, who were killed in the days of the reign of Diocletian the impious.</p>
<p>“As for me, it is because of this that I came, to tell you this and to announce to you that you, Theocleia, your son Aboli, and your beloved Juste will be martyrs by the hands of Diocletian.</p>
<p>“Do not have fear of death when life in heaven is yours.</p>
<p>“Now rise, Theocleia, and mind to attire yourself in the crown of glory that never ages nor withers in the kingdom of heaven.”</p>
<p>When Theocleia had heard this announcement from the mouth of Our Lady Mary, she rejoiced greatly [fort] and was impatient to be a martyr.</p>
<p>She said to Our Lady Mary in a great joy, “May it happen to me, my Lady, as you said to me.</p>
<p>“Only, O my Lady, may your aid not separate itself from me, nor from my son Aboli, nor from your servant Juste.</p>
<p>“Be with us until we drink and empty the goblet to which we were called, so that we might not be seduced nor made to stumble by the serpent who seduced our mother Eve and made Adam our father leave the Garden of delights.</p>
<p>“So that this serpent might not seduce us, may your aid shepherd us until we have fulfilled our fight and our martyrdom to which we were called, I your servant Theocleia and your servants Juste and Aboli.</p>
<p>“O my queen, it is suitable that I offer you glory and thanksgiving, honor and adoration, for you journeyed toward me even though you are the queen of heaven and earth.</p>
<p>“Praise, greatness and benediction by my mouth, to me their servant, suit those who journeyed with you to visit [rendre visite] me.</p>
<p>“Here are your mother Anne, the queen, and your sister Elizabeth, the blessed.”</p>
<p>After she had pronounced all these praises, the blessed Theocleia was impatient to be a martyr.</p>
<p>So Our Lady Mary rose and blessed the blessed Theocleia.</p>
<p>She said to her, “Be firm and strong for this to which you have been called, and I will not separate myself from you until you have completed your fight.”</p>
<p>After this, she [Mary] blessed her and ascended to the sky in a great glory with Anne and Elizabeth, her beloved [plural].[Translation as of 05/21/22]</p>

364,Giyorgis's writing: The abbot who rejected the horologium and other works of Abba Giyorgis of Sägla,Africa Ethiopia confirmed,"Augustine Dickinson: A miracle of Our Lady, Saint Mary ; may her intercession be with her beloved, [ Habtä Iyyäsus ] , for ever and ever. Amen and amen. The wonderful and marvellous grace and (deed of) power that Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin, the Ark of the Holy Spirit, Mary, who is Mariham in Hebrew, wrought on behalf of a certain priest (who was) her beloved and the beloved of her Son, Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. There was an abbot of a certain monastery who was perfect in all good works and faith. And yet he used to hate and (f. 234r) reject the Mahəlet (= hymns)  of Abunä Giyorgis, and look down on those who chanted his Sä' atat (= Horologium). And those who read the books of his treatises he used to forbid lest they read them and would bind them under anathema with a strict oath. He abrogated them in all his domain, so that no one might chant his Horologium and so that no one might read his books, which were revealed to him from God, those holy writings whose titles are the Mäşəhafa Məsțir (= The Book of Mys tery), the Arganonä [ Wəddase (= The Harp of Praise), the Inzira ] Səbhat (= The Lyre of Glory) , in addition to the Mä şəhafä Säkatat zä - Lelit wå - Mäalt (= The Book of the Night and Day Hours), the Hohətä Bərhan (= The Portal of Light), and the many (other) treatises (dealing with) the Old and New Testaments  that the Holy Spirit inspired him (to write). He abolished and abrogated all these in all his territories so that no one might read and chant (them). Furthermore, he accused [ lit. “slandered "" ] (Abba Giyorgis) of other things and abused him with big words of ignominy that cannot be mentioned, as the prophet has said, “Boast not, talk not very proudly and let not words of arrogance come out of your mouth for the Lord God is the discerner of hearts ”. “God has established his throne (f. 234v) in heaven ; and he rules all in his kingdom "". While the abbot was (occupied in saying) all these things, Abunä Giyorgis was also (occupied) in speaking and appealing  to God in heaven and to Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin, the Ark of the Holy Spirit, Mary, who is Mariham in Hebrew, about the wrongs done against him, he said to Our Lady, “See (and judge), O My Lady, according to what you know is hidden in my heart. You are aware whether (or not) the knowledge for my treatises and the understanding for the word (s) of my writings have come from the wisdom of men, which consists) in words of asmat (= magic) and the cutting of plants and leaves (i. e. chemistry). According as you have tested me, you my Queen, from the beginning to the end, (and know) whether I have ever added another beloved besides you or whether I have taken a lady other than you, my redeemer, and according as you know and are aware of all my deeds, judge me, I beg you, and let me appear in judgement with the abbot who reviles me and ridicules me before his (spiritual) children, seeing that it is you who justify me or convict me, O my Queen”. Because of the wrongs done against Abunä (f. 2350) Giyorgis, there came forth a word of command from her Son, Jesus Christ, that they should transport the abbot in haste. Thereupon they transported the soul of the abbot suddenly without agony or pain. They made it ascend according to the rite for the ascent of the souls of the righteous elect. At once the angels of light came up with the nine Archangels in order to receive the soul of the abbot. The great Abunä Giyorgis came with honour and grace along with the Archangels, being equal and decorated like them. The abbot wanted to greet them because he was pure in his monasticism, fragrant in his holiness, and perfect in his virginity, and his labour in (ascetic) combat was extreme. When he wanted to draw near to greet them, the Archangels answered the abbot saying, “Behold, Giyorgis appeals against you recalling the wrongs done against him”. Having said this, they refused an exchange of greeting and left him and went to their assignments. Then they made him ascend higher where the Seraphim were hallowing around (f. 235v) the throne of God. Giyorgis, too, was there incensing, ranked with them. When the abbot drew near to greet them they refused him because of the wrongs done against Abunä Giyorgis. Then they made him ascend where the Cherubim were hallowing on (all) sides of the throne. (There too,) he found Giyorgis ranked with them, carrying the throne of the Righteous Judge. When the abbot drew near to greet them, the Cherubim refused him saying, “Behold, Giyorgis appeals against you, recalling the wrongs done against him”. In a manner similar to this, there came up to the abbot in order to receive him the company of the Prophets in their ranks from Adam to Abraham, from Abraham to Moses, from Moses to John (the Baptist) and from John to Joseph and Nicodemus, who shrouded the body of Jesus Christ, and with them was Abba Giyorgis equal in majesty and grace. When the abbot drew near in order to greet them, they answered him saying, “Greet us not, because Giyorgis appeals against you, recalling to us the wrongs done against him”. After the Prophets, there came the Apostles (f. 236r) of Jesus Christ, from our father Peter to our father Mathias and from our father Paul to all the disciples and doctors – Basil, Gregory and John Chrysostom – and with them was Abunä Giyorgis ranked equal in dignity and authority. He prevented them from greeting the abbot, recalling to them the wrongs done against him . After the Apostles of Our Lord, there came the Martyrs of the Most High : St. Stephen, Blessed George (who is) the King of the Martyrs, Basilides of Antioch, with Theodore, Claudius, Blessed Justus and his son Aboli, St (s). Victor and Mercurius, Blessed Peter, Patriarch of Alexandria, the last of the martyrs, and all the Innocents of Galilee, whose blood was shed in witness to the truth, and with them was Abba Giyorgis, equal in beauty, grace and crown of glory, and like the chosen Innocents, in the adornment of (his) garments. When they wanted to greet him, Abba Giyorgis prevented them (from doing so), recalling the wrongs done against him. Then there came our holy (Desert) Fathers, Abba Paul, Abba Anthony, Abba Macarius, Abba Shenute, Abba Cyrus, the son of the (f. 236v) Emperor (º), Abba Bishoi, who washed (the feet of) Jesus , with all the monks who lived in caves and those who lived) in cells, and with them came Giyorgis adorned with chastity and sanctity like the angels. When the abbot drew near to greet the monks, they answered him saying, “Our son Giyorgis appeals against you, recalling to us the wrongs done against him”. Then, after all of them, came Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin, the Ark of the Holy Spirit, Mary, who is Mariham in Hebrew, and together with her there were Hannah / Anne and Elizabeth, her faithful ones, and all the holy Virgins, Maria and Martha, Mary of Cleophas, (the other) Mary, Salome and Mary Magdalene, and Sts. Sophia, Eupraxia , Anatolia  and The ocleia  and Blessed Barbara and Juliana, and Inbamärena  and the Blessed Tekla, sister of Abba Esi . There, there were also our mother Eve, our mother Edna , our mother Barä ka , and our Matriarch (s), Sarah, Rebekah, Rachel, Leah, Dinah, Deborah and Judith, together with Esther and Asenath  Our Lady Mary came (f. 2376) escorted and encircled by the choir of angels ; Our Lady Mary came while the Prophets were praising her, the Apostles were blessing her, all the company of the Saints and Martyrs were proclaiming her beatitude and Abunä Giyorgis was singing and chanting before her the Arganonä Waddase (= The Harp of Praise) and the Inzira Sabḥat (= The Lyre of Glory)  until the hosts of heaven were amazed at the greatness of his honour. When he came up, the abbot prostrated himself before Our Lady the holy twofold Virgin, the Ark of the Holy Spirit, Mary, who is Mariham in Hebrew. Then, when he wanted to greet her, she answered him saying, “My beloved Giyorgis appeals against you, saying about you : You did me wrong and you reviled me '. But to the extent that I known and have in vestigated the hidden (thoughts) of Giyorgis, I shall make peace between you and him”. Then she said to her beloved Giyorgis, “Behold, the one about whom you say, ' He has done me wrong ; he has reviled me ; he, together with his (spiritual) children, has slandered me'. Behold, I have commanded him in your regard, that he compensate you generously for having slandered you and reviled you in his ignorance”. She then commanded the abbot to submit to Abba Giyorgis. And so Our Lady Mary, who is Mariham in Hebrew, made peace and amity between (f. 237v) the two of them. After that the abbot returned to his former existence by the command of Our Lady Mary. He immediately) went back to his place and gathered together all his (spiritual) children and told them all the grief and affliction that had befallen him in heaven because he had reviled and slandered Abunä Giyorgis. Then he commanded them all to chant his Horologium and (read) the books of all his homilies in all (the churches) built in his domain . The abbot himself, too, from that time on, began to chant the Horologium of the night and the day (hours) and read the book (s) of Abunä Giyorgis without interruption. He persevered in proclaiming and telling everywhere how he had seen with his own eye (s) and heard with his own ear (s) the great ness and honour of Abunä Giyorgis that was given him in heaven. All this happened to the abbot because of his virtue and goodness and because of a miracle of Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin, the Ark of the Holy Spirit, Mary, who is Marihan in Hebrew. May her prayer and petition be with all of us, the children (f. 238r) of baptism, forever and ever. Amen, amen and amen. // O my Lady Mary, who are Mariham in Hebrew, who are / shod with the moon and are clothed with the sun, you who, for the abbot who pleased you, made peace and amity with your faithful one, Abba / Giyorgis, O holy and pure Mary, who are without blemish, for me, too, your devout [ Habtä Iyyäsus), who hopes ever / in you, weaken my opponent by the power of your help.

365,Giyorgis's writing: Saint Mary cuts short her visit to a pious monk when she hears her name invoked according to the horologium of Abba Giyorgis of Sägla,Africa Ethiopia confirmed,"A miracle of Our Lady Mary, Mariham; may her prayer, petition and blessing be with her servant (Habtä Iyyäsus ] for ever and ever. Amen. Now listen, O children of the Church, to the miraculous deed of power of Our Lady which she wrought for those who were devoted to her and were serving her with all their hearts and were chanting the Säatat (= Horologium) of Giyorgis, her beloved, day and night . There was a monk who loved God the Most High with all his heart and all his power. Our Lady Mary, who is Mariham in Hebrew, was continually visiting him (f. 238v) because of his sanctity and because of the purity One day, while Our Lady was with him at the third hour of the day, where she was a guest to visit him, those (devoted) clergymen began to chant the Sä'atat (= Horologium) of Blessed Abba Giyorgis according to their custom. When they came in the text of the hymn to (the place) where it says, “Come, Virgin, with the Prophets to receive our trust (in you) at (this) third hour. Come, Virgin, with the Apostles to bless our community at (this) third hour. Come, Virgin, with the Martyrs to obtain the remission of our sins at (this) third hour.

The monk responded saying to Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin, the Ark of the Holy Spirit, Mary, who is Mariham in Hebrew, “Where are you going, O my Queen? And for whom are you leaving me? Is there any other (person) who loves you as much as I do? And is there any other person who takes refuge in you from the depth of his heart as much as I do?” Our Lady Mary answered the monk saying, “I am going where the community of the Church is invoking me, to those who are invoking me in trust with my fathers the Prophets. I am going where they are invoking me to bless (their) community with my sons the Apostles. I am going where they are invoking me to absolve their sins with my children the Martyrs.

And to those who have invoked me with the spiritual Angels, I go running and hurrying to offer up the prayer of the children of the Church to the throne of my Son and his Father and his Holy Spirit.

<p>“It is the replica of the rags (?) of Jews who, then, surrounded your Son, Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>“Reminding you of all this, O my Lady, deliver my soul from the nets of Satan.</p>
<p>“If your heart accepts that I be your servant, O my Lady, destroy for me this sinful dream, which is a trap in the flesh of all creatures, so that I might tell of your justice, being safe without pollution.</p>
<p>“And so that I might glorify you always during my life and so that I might tell of your miracles without sin. This desire of my heart, accomplish it for me in the greatness of your goodness, O Mother of God. If not, remove my soul from the sojourn of this transitory world.”</p>
<p>So Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, Mother of God, appeared to him and said to him, “Do not have fear and do not be afraid; may doubt not enter into your heart. Is it not by love for me that you contemplated this beautiful plan for those who put it into practice?</p>
<p>“As for the glorifications, they will stay forever and ever, for it is concerning those who are like you, as the prophet said, ‘Happy are they who are pure in their path and they who walk in the law of God!</p>
<p>“‘Happy are they who seek your testimony and seek it with all their heart!’ </p>
<p>“My Son also, the God of armies, said thus in the doctrine/gospel [not capitalized] of the kingdom, ‘Happy are the pure of heart, for they will see God!’ </p>
<p>“My Son Adonaï said again, ‘If you do not change and do not become as little children, you will not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.’”  Having said this, our Lady Mary blessed with her holy and pure hands, without stain [tache].</p>
<p>She said to him (again), “Here I will do for you all the wish of your heart and the will of your thought.</p>
<p>“I will cover you in the purity of angels.</p>
<p>“From now on, this stain [tache] that you hated will not harm you again.</p>
<p>“From now on, this stain [souillure] that you disdained, rejected and reviled will not touch you again.</p>
<p>“Thereafter, it will not approach you again, this sinful pollution that makes flee and moves away, far from love of God and far from love of me.</p>
<p>“Because of this, rejoice and exult with all your heart, for I did for you the desire of your thought.”</p>
<p>She said to him again, “Listen, my friend, believe in me and do not doubt. I will never distance myself from you and, at the moment when you invoke me, I will respond to you and grant you[r wishes].</p>
<p>“Give me your hand, so that I might make for you upon it the sign of good things and (give you) a great power of healing by your hands.</p>
<p>“From this day, I will be with you; I will not separate myself from you until my Son takes you from this transitory world.”</p>
<p>And according to how she had made him this promise, Our Lady made for him great miracles and many wonders, by her hands, so well that kings and princes, bishops and heads of church marveled at his virtue.</p>
<p>The nocturnal dreams did not assail him again until he died and left this world.</p>
<p>He entered into the Kingdom of Heaven by the intercession of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, Mother of God, treasure of mercy and doer of miracles and wonders.</p>
<p>May her prayer, her intercession, and her benediction be with us all, men and women, old and young, priests and deacons, we who stand here to listen to these miracles. </p>
<p>Glorious, Good, and Most High, make us hear today the voice of joy and of exultation, amen and amen.</p>
<p>May she tell us with her mouth, “In this world, I will protect you from bad days and from hours of misfortune – amen – and in the world to come, I will make you inherit the Kingdom of Heaven – amen.</p>
<p>“May none among you create a separation by the death of sin.</p>
<p>“I will write your names with a quill (dipped in) the bed blood of my only Son, the God of armies, there where are written the names of the prophets and the apostles, there where are written the names of the just men and the martyrs.”</p>

367,"When a couple tries to marry their son whom they had dedicated to Saint Mary, he falls sick to the point of death.",,"<p>There was a virtuous and God-fearing man; he loved Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, Mother of God.</p>
<p>He was very rich; his wife also was virtuous and accomplished in good deeds and in faith.</p>
<p>But they grew sad and were very upset about not having children. They distributed and gave their goods to the poor, the needy and the destitute.</p>
<p>After this, the reputation of their virtue was known and spread everywhere.</p>
<p>Every day, they implored Our Lady with great prayer and supplication, with a confident heart, standing before the image of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, Mother of God.</p>
<p>Thus was their prayer and supplication addressed to her, they said to her, “O Our Lady, you listened to the prayer and the wish of Abraham the blessed and of his wife Harik when they supplicated you with a confident heart.</p>
<p>“You granted them and gave a blessed son, holy and chosen, of whom the whole world would not pay the price of only one of the ascetic ordeals   – it is Boula, which, translated, means ‘Holy of God’. </p>
<p>“Now we, your servants like them, implore you and beg you to listen to our prayer. If we gain and get a child with the help of your name, O our Lady, we will not destine him for the works of this world; may he be, on the contrary, your servant and may he not leave the interior of your house. This is the wish of our heart, which comes from beside you.”</p>
<p>While the supplication of these blessed people grew, Our Lady listened to their groaning, considering the purity of their thought, and gave them a pleasant son, a chosen tool who would be profitable to the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p>Seeing this child, his father, his mother, and all of his parents felt a great joy and gave great alms to the poor and needy and precious clothing to the church.</p>
<p>Then they gave him a fine education and he learned all the holy writings of the Old and New (Testament).</p>
<p>When he had grown, matured and arrived at the age of adolescence, they gave him a wife in marriage, abandoning the oath that they had offered to Mary before the conception of the child, saying, “If we get a child with the help of your name, we will not destine him for the works of this world; may he be, on the contrary, your servant.”</p>
<p>It is this oath that they abandoned when they brought to the young man the wife and made the husband and wife enter into the bridal room. Before he had slept with her, the young man was seized by a terrible illness; his powers weakened, his life approached death and he was lying down as a corpse.</p>
<p>His father, his mother, and all his parents considered him as those who fall into a well and are as a man without recourse/aid. </p>
<p>Their joy turned into affliction and their bridal chants into vehement sobs.</p>
<p>So they took him, by carrying him on a stretcher, and put him in the interior of the sanctuary. They left him there, having laid him down like a corpse, and closed upon him the doors of the sanctuary.</p>
<p>After this, they all went to their houses, placing their hope in the power of the aid and the miracles of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, Mother of God.</p>
<p>When the parents of the young man left the church, suddenly, immediately, Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, Mother of God, descended from the sky in a great majesty, clothed in light as a piece of clothing.</p>
<p>Immediately she woke the young man on the stretcher where he was asleep; she addressed herself to him and said to him, “It is because your parents lied toward me, they who, with a great oath, had given you to me so that you would be my servant; it is because of this that all this illness assailed you in an instant.</p>
<p>“As for them, I turned their joy into affliction and their bridal chants into vehement sobs.”</p>
<p>Having said this, she told him all the part (that he would have) with her and his heritage in the kingdom of heaven. She gave him the promise that she would not separate herself from him for ever and ever.</p>
<p>Then she said to him, “Rise and recite the Psalms of David my father; he is loved by me and by my Son, he who recites without ceasing the Psalms of David my father. Do not cease this psalmody until I take you from this world and make you enter the kingdom of heaven.”</p>
<p>Having said this, Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, Mother of God, blessed him and disappeared from his sight.</p>
<p>When it was the moment of midnight, the priests and the deacons entered into the church, as was their custom, to sing the service of the night; they found the young man standing, reciting the Psalms of King David until the end.</p>
<p>Having finished his prayer at the moment when morning pointed [pointait], the young man called all the assembly of the church with his father and his mother.</p>
<p>He said to them, “Greetings to you; I am going to where I was commanded by Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, Mother of God. From now on you will not see me again in the flesh, but only in the kingdom of heaven.”</p>
<p>Having heard this, his father, his mother and his parents cried a lot, but they could not turn him away (from his intention).</p>
<p>That day, he lived in the sanctuary, chanting and praising.</p>
<p>After this, he left in the night without any of the men seeing him.</p>
<p>In this he was similar to the blessed Christodule, the son of the king Constantine.</p>
<p>He arrived beside a spiritual master, according to as he had been ordered by Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, Mother of God, and there made himself a monk.</p>
<p>He earned completely his hermit/anchorite's condition, as the monks who had preceded him, in donning a hair shirt/cilice  and carrying chains.</p>
<p>He pleased God the Most High and served Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, Mother of God.</p>
<p>He died in peace and entered into the kingdom of heaven by the intercession of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, Mother of God, the repository of supplicants.[Translation as of 05/21/22]</p>

Her beloved Sam'on set out to search f or a column of cedar to use it for a support of the nave of Hagärä Maryam. They found a big tree that was planted at the top of a very deep precipice. He asked them if they have found any. They said to him, ""We have, indeed, found a column of cedar, but we think it is impossible (to have it). If they cut it, it will fall in the direction of the precipice and be broken; even if it ends up intact, it will be impossible for them to bring it out, because the way to the precipice will prevent us.” But he said to them, ""Go and cut it down. What do you know (will happen), if Our Lady Mary should work a wonder?” They cut it down, trusting in her. It fell down to the bottom of the precipice but it was not ruined. They saw that it was good. This is the miracle of Our Lady. Not only a column of cedar would be broken, if it fell from the top of a precipice, but even a rock rolled down the precipice, would be smashed and pulverized. After that, they brought it onto the road by the power of the help of Our Lady Mary. They rejoiced in her and sang her praise. The column reached Hagärä Maryam and was set up with its fellow columns that were set up in the house of God (as) supporters of the roof of the nave. Because of the love of this miracle of hers, Sam 'on composed and sang, saying in the middle of the congregation on the feast of the lamp-a feast related to the Nativity of Our Lord Jesus Christ—(observed) on the 40th day of his birth: These are the words of his song. Hagärä Maryam, Oh your miracle! The tree did not break when it fell, so that they might proclaim your power, From the edge of the precipice to where the ground was deep, To make a column for your sanctuary. Those who wanted to obtain it, Carrying it out by hand, With the wing of your feast (of) Simeon, they ascended to the stop. Those who saw (how) difficult (it was) were amazed.

378,Saint Mary appears to Yohannes Kama and he and his wife perserved their virginity throughout their lives,,"XLII THE VIRGIN MARY AND JOHN KAMA [A. Fol. 76a, 1.] THERE was a certain holy man whose name was John Kama, who from his youth up had sought after the love of Christ with great strivings, and when he had grown up they (i.e. his kinsfolk) betrothed him unto a young woman who was a virgin, so that he might marry her. But he made an agreement with her that they should preserve their virginity until the day of their death, and they fulfilled their covenant. And on a certain day, which was the night of Sunday, our holy Lady, Mary the twofold Virgin, the God-bearer, appeared unto John Kama in great glory, and the angels were hovering about her. And by reason of his fear he fell upon his face, but she raised him up, and said unto him, ""Peace be unto thee, O John Kama, who art be loved of my Son, and of His Father, and of the Holy Ghost. Rejoice and be strong, for through thy patient endurance thou shalt become a mighty man, and thou shalt vanquish the unclean spirit-beings of might who array themselves against thee. And I will be with thee until the Will of God be fulfilled, and I will give thee my protection, and my mercy shall preserve thee, and shall be with thee for multitudes of generations. And they shall build a church in thy name, and it shall be called by the name of myself and of my Son; and no enemy or foe shall enter into thy shrine; and the walls thereof shall never be overthrown. And thy [spiritual] sons shall walk in thy commandment, and in thy teaching, and in thy law; and they shall shew themselves loving the one to the other, and they shall live in purity and make offerings unto thee. I will be with them for ever, and I will bless their service and the work of their hands, and they shall inherit everlasting life, together with the kingdom of heaven."" Then she gave him three dinars that were stamped with the sign of the Cross, saying, ""Take these, and put them in the chest of the church that they may be a blessing for ever"" (now they are there unto this day); and having said these words she gave him the salutation of peace, and left him and departed. Then John Kama rejoiced, and he sang the words of the Psalm (xxvii. 8 ff.), saying, ""I have sought Thy face, Thy face, O Lord, I seek. Turn not Thy face away from me, and be a helper unto me; and cast me not away so that I may do Thy will, O my Lord and God."" Observe then, O my brethren, that our Lady Mary doth make herself a protector and a teacher of sinners, and that she doth become a helper of the righteous, for it is by means of her intercession that they fulfil their strivings. And she doth help even the sinful, and doth protect and deliver them from out of the hand of Satan their enemy. Budge, E. A. Wallis, ed. 1933.

When she had finished her cleansing, a silver platter fell from her hands into the water. And she loved the plate greatly, and she stayed for two days looking (for the platter) but she could not find it. And she sorrowed and cried while saying “O my Lady, the Holy Twofold Virgin Mary, I came for the pilgrimage of this place that I might receive your blessing, and you would lose my possession?” After this she went and arrived at her house while she greatly sorrowed. And one time from among the nights, while she was standing (at prayer) our Lady the Holy Twofold Virgin Mary revealed herself to her and said to her: “Go to so-and-so’s church which is in my name, and there you will find your possession” And she went into the church which our Lady the Holy Twofold Virgin Mary proclaimed to her. And the pathway of her road from the place where she lost the plate to the church was a distance of 2 days. And when she arrived, she asked the keeper of the church that he might look for the plate, and when he looked, he found the plate in the water. And he brought it to her and gave it to her. And when the people saw this they marveled greatly and glorified God and praised our Lady the Holy Twofold Virgin Mary, worker of miracles and wonders, may her prayers and blessings be with her servant Sertse Ab who loves her without limit forever, Amen.

And one day he set out on a journey and fainted by the way, and he made haste to reach the church, but was unable to do so, and he fell exhausted under a large tree.

387,Samuˀel of Waldebba miracles: Saint Mary turns water over which her anaphora was recited by Abba Samuˀel of Wali into miraculous bread.,,"<p>Listen, fathers and brothers, with a luminous heart and an attentive spirit, as we narrate to you what Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, Mother of God, did. </p>
<p>One day our father Samuel the Blessed was reciting in prayer the liturgy of Our Lady Mary. </p>
<p>Having placed water before himself, he made upon the water the sign of the cross. When he wanted to drink the water and took it up in his hand, Our Lady Mary made out of this water a white piece of bread of pleasant appearance and agreeable scent. </p>
<p>That scent transported his heart and sated his hunger without his having [even] eaten the bread. Our blessed father said, “I placed this bread in my mouth. I did not know what to compare it to, for it was not like the taste of honey and sugar. It intoxicated me fully by the smoothness of the scent of its fragrance. Immediately, I was rejuvenated and renewed, like an eagle, and my bones were vigorous.” </p>
<p>It is this miracle that Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, Mother of God, did for our father Samuel when she saw the purity of his body, the steadfastness of his heart, and that he had been broken in the spiritual battle for the love of her Son and in the love of her. </p>
<p>END PRAYER: O Our Lady who loves the just and visits the virtuous, hope of sinners, may your prayer and benediction be with us for ever and ever, amen. [Translation as of 05/21/22]</p>

Listen, my brothers, to what Our Lady Mary has done. In the middle of the night while I was asleep, (just) at that time, I heard a voice (of a shining man) and I was startled. He said to me: (f. 132v) ""Look, and fear not."" And that shining man showed me the sign of the cross which was in his hand and a good land in which was a rampart of the cross whose likeness was iron. He ushered me to the inner side of the gate. There, I saw the awe-inspiring ones of the tribe of Israel. A royal crown, whiter than the snow, was placed on the head of (each) of them. I asked him saying, ""Who are these whose stature(s) are (so) beautiful, whose countenance(s) (so) comely, and (who) are vested in bright clothes?"" He said to me, ""These are the kings of Israel. And Joshua the Son of Nun is among them. Their number is 40."" I said to him, ""Which of these is David, King of Israel, whom God has given honor and has said about him, 'I found a man according to my heart'? And which one is his son Solomon whom he had given honor, wealth, and wisdom? And which one is Joshua who stopped the sun in broad daylight?"" He showed me these as they were in great splendor. My soul was pleased, and I gave thanks to God. Then the ground where I stood brightened (f. 133r) like broad daylight. I was startled. I lifted up my eyes into the atmosphere. (There) I saw a decorated crown which had the color of the star(s), in the likeness of many (of them). It was better and more honored than the crown(s) of the former kings whom I saw. It was held in the hands of Our Lady Mary. With her were two angels vested in fire, one on her right side and one on her left side. Beneath her was a circle like a rainbow. And above her was (a spot) like a palace.

She, on her part, called him [Zar'a Ya'aqob] and brought him up into the atmosphere to stand where she was. She put the royal crown on the head of Zar'a Ya'aqob with her (own) hands. She blessed him and said to him, ""Keep the kingdom."" When the kings who were standing under him saw (f. 133r) the man [Zar'a Ya'aqob] arrayed with great honor, they sang (praise).

The Picture Incarnate) A miracle of Mary; may her prayer and the mercy of her Son be with us, amen. There was a church in a monastery. There, on the altar, was an icon of Our Lady Mary and her beloved Son together with the picture( s) of Michael and Gabriel. They celebrated the Eucharist under it. On one of the days, while the priest was giving out communion - prostration is meet to the glory of his kingdom - to the people, (a piece of) the body of Our Lord Jesus Christ dropped. The priests did not see it. Someone who was in the church said,·""I saw and I was terrified. I wanted to flee. At that time Our Lady Mary gave an order to the Archangel Michael saying: 'Lift up (f. 137v) the body of Christ which dropped on the ground.' At that time he lifted (it) up and delivered it to Our Lord Jesus Christ, gripping it with tongs of fire as the Seraphim (had done) before. 19 Furthermore, Our Lord gave an order to Michael (saying): 'I have already given it to them for the remission of sin(s). And now put (it) on the holy paten.'"" He said, ""I heard when Our Lord Jesus spoke these words, and I saw when he [the angel] put it back on the paten."" He related (this) to a certain man. Then this incident was revealed to those who know (hidden things). Furthermore, a monk who lived in a different place said that he saw on the same day the same vision, (as did) a nun who lived in a far away land, a distance of two-days' walk till evening. This icon is clothed with a (human) body. It moves and talks. The Spirit of God dwells in it. You should not think that it is a (mere) picture. She is, indeed, Our Lady the Virgin (herself) and (f. 138r) he is Jesus, the Only-Begotten Son (himself). Michael and Gabriel, too, are as themselves, as that icon [has spoken] to a certain monk who came to the monastery wanting to live here [lit. there] with us. He held special prayer at the church.  The abbot said to a certain monk, ""You, too, hold special prayer for the sake of this monk, O father."" He [the guest] did diligently, (the father) helping him. Again, she came as usual clothed with rational body and said to him, ""Why do you, the excommunicated, live at this church? Go to the monastery, to the abbot - (who) has given you the order - before he dies, so that you [lit. he] may not be damned. And pray (for) your soul; let not your enemy, the Devil, snatch you and destroy you (by death) without penance. Confess to a priest. Do not go out from there until God does at the monastery what he wants."" That hermit whom the abbot commanded said to us, ""Let him go. "" The gist of the matter, however, (f. 138v) he did not tell us because he hid (it) from us, although he knew the hidden things of all. Then we helped him off to his homeland. We gave him provisions for the journey in accordance with our poverty; and we sent him our two boys (to see him oft). But the monk kidnapped one (of) our child(ren). He took him to own him and make him his boy. When we knew (this), we, all the monks, assembled and held counsel and sent one (of) our boy(s), who returned, with a missive.

There, there were many monks; they were about one hundred thirty. And the laymen were multitudes. Now as they were assembled in church on a Sunday Sabbath, a Muslim came to the place of the assembly. When a believer saw him, he said to him, ""Since you are a Muslim and a Gentile, why are you standing (here) to come into a place of (Christian) learning (and) sit?"" He said to him, ""To hear the book."" The Christian said to him, ""Come to Christianity."" The Gentile answered him, saying to him, ""Is the religion of the Christians better than (that of) the Ishmaelites [=Muslims]?"" The Christian answered him - he was zealous with a great (f. 139v) spiritual zeal. He said to him, ""O defiled dog, did you not know that the religion of Christ is better than (that of) a Muslim? They [the Christians] live showing miracles, and after their death, too, they work miracles with which they heal the paralytic; some open (the eyes of) the blind."" The Muslim said, ""God did neither beget nor was he begotten."" And he increased blaspheming while talking. He said, ""You (Christians) sculpt a (piece of) wood and say: '[This] is a tabot,' and prostrate before it; and you call it 'Our God.""' Furthermore, the lawless one said, ""You say: 'We eat the flesh of Our God,' and you prepare (it) from wheat. You prepare wine and say: 'It is his blood,' and drink it.""

Then (f. 140v) the monks assembled at a hilly place of the monastery and took counsel to help the Christian. They said to him, ""Let it be on Monday."" The Christian, however, was burnt by the love of Our Lady and by the love of Jesus her Son. And the Gentile said, ""I will not postpone (it) to Monday but (let him do it) today (to see) if he will be saved."" The Christian said, ""Why do you plead with him (for time}?

While I was water she (sic} made me blood, (while} earth she made me body, (while} wind [she made me soul]. Then he breathed fire and (made me} perfectly hot, to be Adam.""

They brought wood to make fire. Then (f. 141r) they brought the big axe itself - with which they cut four-face columns of the church - to heat it. There was a huge assembly (of) monks, laymen, and Muslims. They brought the picture of the Annunciation [lit. Incarnation] and the picture of Our Lady with her beloved Son.

<p>There was a sick man in the land of [ ... his son too was sick]. </p>
<p>He prayed before the picture of Our Lady with a heated heart and with many tears, saying, ""O my Lady Mary, am I forgotten from the mercy of Your Son? (f. 148r) My sin is great before God, because I have enraged the Holy Spirit in my great transgression and trespassing. Behold, my son is ill; he is on the verge of dying. O rescuer and helper for those who are in tribulation, help me and let this child of mine be healthy by your good will. Remember the covenant which has been given to you [text, me] by your Son. The whole world is saved through you. Furthermore, remember the descent of your Son from the highest heaven to the time of his birth, from his birth to his wandering (in), and flight from, the world. (Remember) the tribulation, toil, and much sorrow which found you in taking the difficult journey. Furthermore, remember the outcry, much (and) bitter grief, and lamentation which found you because of his passion, his scourging, his nails, his crucifixion, and his death until his resurrection and ascension into heaven of your body in glory. I, on my part, have cast my soul and body in your hand. I take refuge with you, O my Lady Mary, the temple of the fire of the Divinity, (f. 148v) because taking refuge with the one who saves is meet. Where is your former help which kept me and brought me to this day? O my Lady Mary, the Savior of the whole world, forgive my transgression and cause the remission of my sin. Refuse not my petition. Have mercy and compassion upon me, your servant, for you are the Mother of Mercy, for I have no other God but your Son, nor have I any hope but you. And you know everything. However, let your will be done."" </p>
<p>After a few days, Our Lady Mary consented and allowed that her wonders to appear. </p>
<p>She dispatched Cyriacus the Child, the Wonderworker, to keep that son of the sick man and save him from death. </p>
<p>When Cyriacus shadow (and) the sign of salvation [i.e. the cross] which was in his hand approached, the (evil) spirits moved away from him. He [the man?] rose up and said, ""Do you not see this light?"" (f. 149r) </p>
<p>Those who were with him said to him, ""What do you see?"" </p>
<p>The [sick man] again spoke, saying to them, ""Behold, I see a happy and bright child. He says to me: 'I, Cyriacus, have come from my place to keep you from the time of [death]. Fear not.'"" </p>
<p>Those [with the sick man] who heard this marvelled and glorified God and his Mother Mary. </p>
<p>(The man said,) ""After this came many holy men, whose vestments were beautiful and whose faces were bright. They did not reveal to me their names. They carried cross(es). They were magnificent. Their sight, when they speak the good things pertaining to God, pleases the heart. When I heard their word(s) my body became healthy, as though no illness had touched it at all. There is neither weakness nor illness in me for it [the illness] has past. God has strengthened me by the help of Mary."" </p>
<p>“This took place in the middle of the sea, when the storm blew and the waves of the sea moved upwards, downwards, to the right and to the left. (f. 149v) We were terrified because of fear of death.”</p>
<p>The hour of death is (indeed) difficult. It cannot pass by paying with the wealth of the transient world, but by good deed (which) prolongs the days, as has been written which says, ""Depart from evil, and do good. "" Furthermore, Paul said, ""Who shall separate us from the love of Christ, hunger, persecution, nakedness, tribulation, agony or sword?"" And not spear either. At the time of death (all this) passes. Happiness too does not last forever. The way of (life) is difficult. Its suffering is more than its happiness. Blessed is he who despises it and speaks out (against) it. He will be vested with clothes of light. Which man depended on God and was frustrated? Who perished because of taking refuge with Mary, who is the hope for the hopeless? She is the ferryboat of salvation, a means for crossing over death, who does not despise the one who loves her with a persevering heart. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Listen to the miracle which she worked. </p>
<p>When [the sick man] invoked her name in his sickbed, (f. 147r) she came to the sick man in great majesty, a huge host escorting her on her right and left sides. And George of Lydda was mounted on a white horse and was holding a spear in his hands (sic). He pierced Satan, opened the earth, and drowned him into the deepest. </p>
<p>The [sick] child who was healed from his illness said, ""I saw Our Lady Mary in reality. None of the decoration of this world resembles her.  [I greeted her.] </p>
<p>“And she said to me: 'I came to save you from death.' While she was saying this to me, she touched me by the edge of her clothes and made me smell a fragrance sweeter than perfume. My body was healed instantly and my bones refreshed. I became healthy as one whom no illness has touched.’ </p>
<p>“Furthermore, she said to me: 'This, whom you see, is George; he follows me (always). He never parts from me wherever I go. I send him to all (places) for help.' </p>
<p>“Then she ordered [the angels to (f. 147v) build a rampart of fire] so that the evil spirits could not come out. Those who were vested in fire made, accordingly, the rampart of fire."" </p>
<p>Since that hour all demons were removed. </p>
<p>By the help of the Virgin Mary, the sorcerers were unable to inflict any harm on him. May her prayer and petition be with us, amen. [Translation as of 05/21/22]</p>

And it came to pass one day that he carried off some of the possessions of our Lady Mary according to his wont, and the people caught that thief, and beat him, and bound him in fetters and chains, and then they thought that they would take away his life (?). And he said, “I place my trust in our holy Lady, the two-fold “Virgin Mary, for whosoever believeth in her prayers shall be saved “from all sorrow”. Then she appeared openly unto the men who had beaten him, and had laid hands upon him that they might take away his life, and she said unto them, “Release him”; and they released him by the command of our holy Lady, the two-fold Virgin Mary, and set him free from his fetters; and all the people marvelled at her mercy.

420,The man who accepted fine clothes as a bribe for future favors.,,"EMML 2059, f. 69r  The miracle of Our Lady Mary, who is Mariham in Hebrew. May her prayer and blessing be with us. Amen.  There was a country among the Christian countries. Great Christian people lived in it strictly guarded, because they had a guard who guarded them so that many people should not come to them from other countries with- out the permission of the great ruler. They, too, were made rulers in their turn when God called them to rule the country.  Now the ruler appointed a man to guard those great people strictly so that no one should come to them from another country. The official made friends with one of those great people so that he might do him favor when he ascended the highest office. He made a covenant with him and gave him and his wife precious and beautiful clothes. But the great ruler appointed their friend, the official, to another country. When the official, their friend, went away from them they grieved greatly. The man and his wife were very frightened. They said, ""Woe unto us; if our friendship and covenant with the official are discovered the great ruler will kill us. Where shall we hide the clothes which he gave us? It will never remain our secret even if we dig the ground and bury [them], or hide [them] in our grain store or burn [them] with fire."" Having said this, they went to [another] one of those great people and said to him, ""0 our friend, we have come to you so that you might comfort us in whatever way God reveals to you, because a great grief has befallen us."" He said to them, ""What is your grief?"" They said to him, ""We adjure you in the name of God that you will not disclose our affair to other people."" He said to them, ""Let it be so."" Then they told him about the clothes which their friend the official had given them, and how they could not find [a place] where they might hide [them]. He said to them, ""Give the clothes to the church of St. Mary of such and such city altering1 ^them] as [they] should be for [use in] a church. I trust that Our Lady Mary will remove your grief caused by the calamity you are worried about."" They said to him, ""You said well, 0 friend; the Spirit of God spoke through you. But we do not know how to sew, 0 our friend."" He said to them, ""I shall sew [them] for you helped by the power of the prayer of Our Lady Mary, Mother of God."" They gave him the clothes so that he might sew [them] for them. When they finished sewing [them] they gave [them] to the church of Our Lady Mary, who is Mari ham in Hebrew. She removed their grief and delivered them from the calamity they had anticipated.  Then Our Lady Mary, who is Ma riham in Hebrew, appeared to the man who advised those people to give the clothes to the church of Our Lady Mary, on the 29th of the month of Maggabit, the day on which she conceived Our Saviour. She appeared to him in the likeness of a beautiful woman with a red face. The edge of her eyelashes was clear as if she had cried very much. She told him about the beating of his body with a stick which he would receive from the great ruler.  Nine months later she held his hands and said to him, ""Did they beat you with a stick? But be not afraid; your bones are not broken."" Then the man saw on the same night [in a vision], a big white tent pitched. He saw Our Holy Lady Virgin Mary entering into the tent. He , too, entered [the tent] following her. There he found the great ruler lying down and Our Lady Mary, who is Mari ham in Hebrew, sitting by his head. There was a silver ring on the finger of the ruler. She ordered the great ruler to give his ring to the / man. He refused. She ordered the man to take the silver ring from the finger of the ruler. He took [it], as she has ordered him, and put [it] on his finger. Furthermore, she said to him, ""Suckle the breast of the ruler."" When he suckled [it] there cane out milk for him in great quantity. Furthermore, she said to him, ""Make the memorial of the ruler; I entrust [that] to you. Take heed, never forget his memorial."" Having said this, she disappeared from him.  After that the man sat on the throne of the ruler for many years, appointed to his dominion by the intercession of Our Lady Mary, who is Mariham in Hebrew.

<p>One day among days, a governor who was under the authority of the king left to roam the region of Upper Egypt in order to gather the taxes of the king and to inquire about lands upon which they would give royalties to the king and about those upon which they would give nothing.</p>
<p>While the governor circulated within the region of Quesquâm, there was a land of Dabra Quesquâm that the kings had created many days ago.</p>
<p>The monks of Dabra Quesquam sowed crops there and fed themselves.</p>
<p>Muslims came beside the governor and said to him, “There is a land from/of which the monks eat. It is not suitable that the Christians eat of the king’s land for free.” They accused the monks and toughened the heart of the governor.</p>
<p>After this, the governor called the superior and all the monks. He said to them, “Why do you eat of this land? Who gave it to you and how long have you eaten here?”</p>
<p>They said to him, “We do not know the days during which our fathers ate of this land, for they are many.”</p>
<p>The governor had the superior’s hands and feet tied and said to him, “Leave this land and bring much money, for you yourself said, ‘I do not know the number of days that we have eaten of this land.’”</p>
<p>The superior said to him, “I do not have money to give you, for I am a poor monk.”</p>
<p>When the governor heard this, he felt a violent rage and ordered that he [superior] be whipped, all the while saying, “Bring the money.”</p>
<p>When they had tormented him greatly, the superior sent [someone] to search for the patens and chalices, the cross and the silver censer of the church. He gave them to the governor and said to him, “This is what I acquired from the first day until today; I have nothing other than this.”</p>

May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved son be with us unto ages of ages, amen.</p>

<p>There was a certain pilgrim from the land of Francia who was very wealthy in gold and silver and fine clothes. When he heard the story of a certain icon of Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin Mary, the birth-giver of God, he became exceedingly glad and abandoned his journey and all his possessions and went to the city of Saidnaya. He arrived there in the guise of a poor servant, doing this so that he might steal the icon and take it back to his own country, Francia. And he stayed there, serving her church in the city of Saidnaya.</p>

<p>And two years passed as he waited to find the shutter of the window open so that he might take the icon and flee to his own land, but the abbess guarded the shutter of the window every day. Since it was not possible for him to take the icon, he took a knife, put his hand through the latticework, and cut off a piece of the body from the icon. Suddenly, a great quantity of blood flowed from it. Having taken the piece of the body, he left, fleeing.</p>

<p>And when the people learned that he had hidden himself, they searched for him and, when they found him, seized him and wanted to kill him. But a voice came out of the icon of Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin Mary, the birth-giver of God, which said, “Leave him be and do not kill him, for he did not do this wickedly but, on account of my love, he took it so that it might be for him a blessing.”</p>

<p>So they only took from him the piece which he had cut from the body of the icon and did as she had ordered them. And they returned this piece of the body to its proper place, and it became one with the rest of the icon and the icon became as it was before, except for a trace of the knife and the blood, which remains even to this day.</p>

<p>And they praised the Lord, praiseworthy and glorified, and they praised Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin Mary, the birth-giver of God, full of mercy.</p>

<p>May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved son be with us unto ages of ages, amen.</p>

442,Holy Family journey cycle: Saint Mary is welcomed when she returns to Galilee.,,"<p>Our Lady rose up and moved from there [Diemodar] and reached beneath Gelila. Men, women, old people and children all came up and received her. They greeted her saying “May your entrance be peaceful [welcome!].” Our Lady said to them, “If you are children of peace, [I wish] peace be with you. But, if you are evil, a day of trial will find you.” They replied “We are not foreigners. Rather, we are your family and your children. We are indeed your people.” Our Lady Mary entered into their houses. They gave her a beautiful place. She stayed there for three days. They brought to her numerous cattle and sheep. Our Lady Mary refused to accept the offering of the people of the city. Rather, she said “Give your hands to the poor and needy so that you might receive unending treasure in the heavens forever and ever. Amen.” They replied “Ok. Let us do as you commanded us.” They went to their houses and did as Our Lady Mary commanded them. She lived there for 49 days. She healed many sick people. She casted out demons. She made the deaf hear. She made the mute to speak. She cleansed lepers.</p>
<p>[Seeing all this,] The people of the city greatly exalted Our Lady Mary and said “O Our Lady Mary dwell with us. Do not be separated from us. We will never transgress your command!”</p>
<p>Our Lady Mary replied “This decision is not mine. Rather, it happens only if my son wills it.”</p>
<p>The people replied “O Our Lady, please don’t say like this.”</p>
<p>Our Lady Mary replied “I did not come here for your sake. Neither did I live faring from one desert to another because of you. Rather, [all this] was for the sake of my son.”</p>
<p>The people of the city [accepting her refusal] said “May you live wherever you wish.” Then, they went home.</p>
<p>The next day, she moved from there and reached the city of Nazareth. When she arrived, all the Nazareans received her. They said “How have you been? Welcome.” They told her all that happened: How the angel of the Lord punished Herod and how Archelaus his son became a king inplace of his father.</p>
<p>Our Lady Mary said “How are they looking for me? Or are not they [looking for me]?”</p>
<p>They replied “We haven’t heard about it: whether they are searching for you.”</p>
<p>She said “Is Archelaus wise? Or a fool like his father?”</p>
<p>They replied “We have no knowledge of his wisdom. We also haven’t recognized his foolishness yet.”</p>
<p>Our Lady Mary stayed there for 2 months. After this, Jesus entered a synagogue as he was accustomed to doing. The minister [of the synagogue] gave Jesus, who is called the Christ, the Book of Isaiah. He opened the book and found the place where it says about him “He [God] has anointed me to tell the poor. He sent me to preach the chosen year of the Lord, to teach a new Law to the gentiles, to save the oppressed, to ransom the exiled. My Father sent me.” He closed the book and gave it back to the minister. Those who were in the synagogue raised their eyes. The priests and the rabbis said to one another “What is this? How does the one who did not learn the book know [it]?” They wondered at the grace of his words and the sweetness of his speech and the eloquence of his tongue [literally ‘mouth’]. Lord Jesus knew what they were thinking. He replied “My teaching is not my own, but it belongs to the one who sent me. He gave me [the authority] to teach before authorities.” Jesus said to them “Had you known me, you would have known the one whom you sent me.” All of them rose up and grabbed Jesus. They took him to the edge of a mountain to throw him down. He escaped from their hands and passed through their midst. After that they began to fight Jesus. Jesus [however] did not trust them in anything. For he knew what their deeds were without anyone telling him. Then, he left from there and came to where his mother was in the house of Tiebeodanos. He told her what the high priests and the rabbis were saying to him. His mother replied “Be careful, o my son, don’t let them kill you because of their envy.” She said this not because she knew [something]. Rather, she prophesied what will happen in the later days. For they will crucify him because of their envy. Jesus said “O my mother, even if all the nations in the world stand against me they can’t harm me without my will.” After this, he wanted to play with children. He saw a disc that was ascending through the window which was a ray. He climbed on it. When the male and female children of the Jews saw him. They jumped down from the upper storey because they thought that the disc would hold them. They fell down and smashed on the ground and died. They were 49. When their fathers and mothers saw [this] and cried out. They tore their clothes. They went to Our Lady Mary and said “What is it that came upon us because you and your son? For truly you are a sorceress as people say about you! You escaped from Herod and came here to destroy our children!” May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her son be with her female slave Welete Sara forever and ever. Amen.[Translation as of 05/21/22]</p>

458,Däbrä Metmaq miracles: The Muslims who spent the night at the ruins of Däbrä Metmaq.,Africa Egypt confirmed (Dabra Mǝtmāq),"<p>It is said how Our Lady made a miracle at Dabra Metmâq after the Muslims had destroyed the church.</p>
<p>As nine mulsims and two of their young children walked to commence, having hired camels and donkeys, they arrived at Dabra Metmâq. </p>
<p>It was the day of the feast of Our Lady Mary which is the 21st of genbot.</p>
<p>While they were walking, one said, “Come, let’s spend the night at Dabra Metmâq.”</p>
<p>The others said to him, “We will not pass the night there, for it is a Christian church.”</p>
<p>He said to them, “Didn’t they destroy it? What does it matter to us?”</p>
<p>So they advanced and entered into (what remained of) the church. When it was evening, they unburdened [débâtèrent] their camels and dropped their belongings.</p>
<p>They hobbled their camels.</p>
<p>Having dined, they dozed off.</p>
<p>Some among them did not go to sleep.</p>
<p>Those who did not go to sleep saw the heavens open. They woke those who were asleep and said to them, “See this miracle.”</p>
<p>When they saw the miracle, they rose and stood, in fear and in trembling, to watch what happened.</p>
<p>There descended a great column of light which shone seven times brighter than the sun. Its height reached the sky.</p>
<p>The angels of God climbed it and descended.</p>
<p>Then a throne descended beside the altar of the sanctuary.</p>
<p>Our Lady Mary descended with the luminous armies of heaven, the assembly of the just and the martyrs, around her, praising her. All the creatures praised her and sang for her a hymn with a smooth modulation. She sat upon the throne in a great majesty.</p>
<p>Fear and trembling seized the Muslims.</p>
<p>They stood, trembling and afraid.</p>
<p>Our Lady Mary saw the Muslims standing, nine adults and two young children with them.</p>
<p>Our Lady said to the angels, “Bring me the children.”</p>
<p>An angel went beside them and made them approach her.</p>
<p>He made one stand to Our Lady’s right and the other to her left.</p>
<p>She said to one, “What is your name?”</p>
<p>He said to her, “Mohammed.”</p>
<p>She said to him, “From now on, may your name be Michael.”</p>
<p>Then she said to the other, “What is your name?”</p>
<p>He said to her, “Ali.”</p>
<p>Our Lady Mary said to him, “May your name be George.”</p>
<p>They were called Michael and George so that the miracle of Our Lady Mary, Twice-Virgin, might be revealed.</p>
<p>She called the angels again so that they would make the Muslims approach her.</p>
<p>When they [angels] had made them approach, Our Lady Mary, Twice-Virgin, said to the Muslims, “Why do you dwell in darkness?</p>
<p>“You will enter into the Gehenna of eternal fire.</p>
<p>“Why do you not believe in the name of my Son?</p>
<p>“Why do you not seek the salvation of your soul and not receive the Christian baptism?”</p>
<p>At this moment, the Muslims bowed before her.</p>
<p>They said to her, “Beginning today, we are Christians; we believe in the name of your Son and we will receive the Christian baptism.”</p>
<p>And they said to her, “Intercede for us beside your beloved Son; thus we will not return to our town.”</p>
<p>Our Lady said to them, “Go into the country of Christians receive the baptism, and become Christians.</p>
<p>“My Son will pardon you your former sins.”</p>
<p>They bowed before her, then rose to leave.</p>
<p>They said to the children, “Come, leave with us.”</p>
<p>But the children cried with great sobs. They gripped the clothes of Our Lady, saying, “We will not leave here and we will not separate ourselves from you. If you leave us, they will take us back into Islam.”</p>
<p>The others said to them, “We will not take you back into Islam.</p>
<p>“We will not return to it ever again.”</p>
<p>With great difficulty, they took hold of the crying children.</p>
<p>When they had seen this miracle of Our Lady Mary, Twice-Virgin, they marveled and were astonished.</p>
<p>They stood and saw her ascend to heaven with all the saints, as she had previously descended.</p>
<p>When it was morning, they took a calamus  [calame] and wrote a letter, so that they might send it to their house, saying, “We will not return beside you. We are Christians, we are going into another country and we will receive baptism.” They folded the paper, rose, and went on their way.</p>
<p>While they were going, they saw on the way a Christian who was going, mounted upon a horse.</p>
<p>At that moment, he descended from his horse; they saw him want to mount again. They ran beside him and said to him, “Listen to what we are going to tell you.”</p>
<p>He grew irritated against them and said to them, “This is not possible for me, for my companions left before me and I would not [be able to] find them.”</p>
<p>They said to him, “Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, Mother of God, will guide you and make you find them.</p>
<p>“Distance your servant from here, for we have something to tell you.”</p>
<p>He said to them, “Who spoke to you the name of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, Mother of God; you are Muslims, don’t you not know her?”</p>
<p>The children came and sat upon the knees of the Christian.</p>
<p>One said, “My Lady named me Michael.”</p>
<p>The other said, “She named me George.”</p>
<p>Their fathers did not allow them to speak.</p>
<p>They scolded them and said to them, “Keep quiet,” so that they would not speak.</p>
<p>The children did not control themselves, in the greatness of their joy.</p>
<p>Their fathers made them afraid, saying, “(Fear?) that the Muslims hear you speak and kill you; that Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, Mother of God, grows irritated against you; and that you will descend into punishment.”</p>
<p>When the children heard this speech, they took fear and said to the Christian, “Hasten to baptize us.”</p>
<p>The man said to them, “It does not fall to me to baptize you, for I am not a priest.”</p>
<p>When they heard these words, they had fear of dying without baptism and kept quiet.</p>
<p>Then the people said to the man, “Listen to the words that we are going to tell you.”</p>
<p>He said to them, “Speak.”</p>
<p>They made him know the whole miracle that had taken place at Dabra Metmâq.</p>
<p>They said to him, “Make this letter reach our town for us.”</p>
<p>But the Christian said to them, “If I carry this letter, they will kill me.”</p>
<p>The people said to him, “If you meet someone on the way or at the market, send them for us so that they might give it to them.”</p>
<p>When George heard this, he said to his brother, “You, you will go beside your father, an infidel and a dog, and he will make you Muslim.</p>
<p>“Me, I will not go with you and I will not separate myself from the Christian.”</p>
<p>Then he turned toward the Christian and said to him, “I saw Our Lady in white clothing which shone more than the sun.</p>
<p>“As for the angels, they spoke to me.</p>
<p>“They said to me, ‘This is Our Lady, the Holy Mary.</p>
<p>“ ‘It is she who, during her feast, appeared for the salvation of your souls so that you might believe in the name of her Son.</p>
<p>“ ‘This is the place which was demolished by the sin of the people which was done in the church of Our Lady.</p>
<p>“ ‘ Because of this, the Muslims destroyed it.</p>
<p>“ ‘If she did not want it, they would not have been able to destroy it.’ ”</p>
<p>When the people wanted to go, the young boy said to his father, “Me, I do not want to go back to your house.</p>
<p>“Did you not see what I wrote, saying, ‘I will never come back to your house?’ ” </p>
<p>Having risen, the people went into another place, were baptized, and became Christians.</p>
<p>They were saved by the intercession of Our Lady to all, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, Mother of God.[Translation as of 05/21/22]</p>

May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved son be with us unto ages of ages, amen.</p>

<p>There was a certain man, a monk of Dabra Ṭimonā, whose name was Ephrem. He was a fisherman for the monks of the monastery. Every year he commemorated the feast of Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin Mary, the Birth-giver of God, on which she received the Covenant of Mercy from her son. On the day of her feast, he would give fish to all the men of the monastery.</p>

<p>One day, he called the monks of the monastery so that he could catch some fish, and 270 men followed him in order to carry the fish. Arriving at the edge of the sea, he stood and cast his net over the sea and, dragging the net, took the fish out. Suddenly, a serpent devoured him and the monks fled and told the abbot.</p>

<p>The abbot ordered that they should sound the semantron. The monks gathered and he announced to them that a serpent had devoured Ephrem. Immediately, they went into the church and stood before the icon of Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin Mary, the Birth-giver of God, and supplicated to her, saying prayers so that she might release Ephrem from the death of the marsh. And she appeared to the abbot that night in a dream, showing him the place where the serpent would rest at the edge of the sea. And the abbot took the monks to the place where Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin Mary, the Birth-giver of God, appeared to him. And the serpent came out and approached them, wishing to devour them, and the monks cried out to Our Lady Mary, the Birth-giver of God, and prayed the Salutation of the Angel.1 And she received their prayer and commanded the beast and made it spit him up.</p>


<p>Ten days and ten nights after the serpent had devoured him, Ephrem came out of the belly of the beast alive, having not been harmed him at all. They washed him of the foul odor, perfumed him, and led him to a feast.

Listen, I will tell you, O Christian people. The beginning of the genealogy of Zion, our refuge, [is] at the time when Moses fasted for forty days and forty nights at Mount Sinai. The Lord had given him the stone Tablet[s], on which the Ten Commandments were inscribed, which say: ‘I am the Lord your God, whom I brought you from the land of Egypt, out of the place of your bondage’. (20va). First commandment— ‘Do not worship other gods except Me’. Second commandment—‘Do not make any god like that which is in the heaven above or in the earth beneath, or in the water under the earth. You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I the Lord your God am a jealous God, requiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and the fourth generation of those who hate me, but doing mercy to the thousandth generation of those who love me (20vb) and keep my commandment[s]’. Third commandment—‘Do not swear falsely by the name of the Lord, your God; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes His name falsely’. Fourth commandment—‘Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor, and do your work and all you are commanded; but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God; in it you shall not do any work [you] or a woman, or your son, or your daughter, or your maidservant, or your ox, or your ass, or your cattle, or (21ra) your manservant, or the sojourner who is with you. For in six [days] the Lord made the heaven and the earth, the sea and all that is in them, and He rested on the seventh day; therefore, the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it’. Fifth commandment—‘Honor your father and your mother and let it be a pious deed for you, that He may lengthen your days in the land which the Lord your God gives you’. Sixth commandment—‘You shall not kill’. Seventh commandment—‘You shall not commit adultery’. Eighth commandment— ‘You shall not steal’. Ninth commandment—‘You shall not bear false witness against your (21rb) neighbor’. Tenth commandment ‘You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, or his house, or his plough, or his manservant, or his maid servant, or his cow, or his ox, or anything of the cattle that your neighbor possesses’. Our Lord inscribed this with His hand. And all the people of Israel saw the sound of the light, which is the torch and the sound of the trumpet; and smoke was coming from the mountain. All people were standing at distance out of fear. And Our Lord said to Moses ‘Let this Law be the Law and a help to you forever, for you and your followers’. And Moses received (21va) the Tablet[s] of the Law. The Lord said to Moses ‘Let you go, from here for your people have sinned’. When he went, he found them worshiping an idol. Then Moses was dismayed; and the Tablet(s) of the Law fell down from his hand and broke. And Moses wept and went (back) to Mount Sinai and said to the Lord, ‘The Tablet[s] of the Law that You gave me is broken’. Then the Lord replied to him, ‘Make it its image the Tablet[s] of the Law from incorruptible wood’. And Moses did as the Lord had commanded him. And he made a tabernacle (21vb) and stretched out the curtain. He put Her in the middle of his camp. Amsalu Tefera. 2015.

493,Ark of Zion cycle: Part ?: Homily on the giving of the Law and the fashioning of the Tabernacle.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed,"(4) I cry aloud and wonder; I praise and sing in celebration of Her feast by the golden lamp stand. Our Lady, pure and bright, the celestial Zion, the true Ark of the Law, whom celestial and terrestrial beings praise. (5) None can be equated to Her in beauty and splendor, in honor and greatness except only the Lord. (6) When the feet of my mind went around in Her courtyards, I rejoiced and said ‘I will read and interpret even though I am unworthy. In the beginning God created the heaven. And the earth was existed from old age’. (7) And again I will proceed and say ‘He who loved the mountain of Zion built His sanctuary on the heights. And He established Her forever on earth. She is the earth existed before the world’. (8) The celestial Zion, in whom the saints reside, who reigns forever and ever, together with those of Her, while the light of His Lamb is shining for Her. Mount of Zion situated towards the east, by the side of which is southeast. (9) The city of the great king, for whose coming righteous men and saints, those who shared Her wealth, were waiting. And the Lord knows all without exception. He chose Zion and founded Her to be his dwelling and said ‘I will dwell in Her for I was well pleased in Her and chose Her’. (10) Truly, the Lord God having known that He founded Zion from the beginning when He caused the exodus of His people from making bricks and from the house of bondage, He said to Moses, His servant and prophet, when he was ascending to Mount Sinai ‘Stand there for me. (11) There is no one who ascended with you and there is no one who is present at the mountain top except you. And take off your sandals from your feet, for the ground where you are standing is Holy’. After He finished saying this and the like, He gave him the Tablets of the Law in his hand, which are inscribed on both sides: on this side and on that side. (12) As for their writing, it was the writing of the Lord. The name of the Lord Iota which allegorically means ‘Son of God’, was engraved on the Tablet. And the Lord said to Moses ‘I have given you this tablet of covenant, by which I will establish My covenant with all Israelites’. (13) When He said this to Moses having known in the womb of Mary who is Zion, Ark of Law, of the covenant, in order that the faithful who are Israelites could be saved by Her. (14) When Moses was before the Lord, he received this Tablet in his hand which was made skillfully in ink of fire by the fingers of the divinity. (15) The inscription was as follows: according to the Hebrew language and in the letters of Enoch which he was taught. Its words and its spaces were like this: the Ten Commandments, which are one letter and one stroke, as compared with which it would be easier for Heaven and earth to pass away. (16) And again the Lord said to Moses ‘I filled with wisdom Baslʾel of Uri, son of Hur of [the tribe of] Judah, and Elyab [son] of Ahisamach, of the people of Dan. (17) I gave them the Holy Spirit, wisdom and full knowledge in order for them to perform every action for the Tabernacle, the sacred Ark, the candlestick, and the observation window which is above it inside the Tabernacle’. (18) Then Moses having received the order and having taken that Tablet, descended from Mount Sinai. He returned to the people and told them about the Law of the Lord and ordered those two wise men to carry out the ordinance of the Tabernacle. And they prepared Her in a way that was never (before) conceived of by the heart of man. (19) ‡…‡ Ten curtains, for each end, whose height was twenty-eight cubits. And made a curtain and its width was four cubits. They made the curtain of the tabernacle of violet purple and the color of liver; and an image of the Cherub inside ‡…‡ four columns. (20) They made the Mercy Seat over Her where the Ark of holiness of the Lord was standing. And two Cherubim: one Cherub at one margin of the Mercy Seat and the other at the other margin. They were protecting (it) with their wings. Seven are Her golden lamps. (21) And everything that was made for the construction of the sanctuary was pure gold which they brought. Its number was twenty-nine talents and seven hundred and thirty shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary. And as for the silver, it was a hundred talents and one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five shekels, (with which) they made capitals for the columns and overlaid and adorned Her. (22) And the work of the tabernacle was completed. And as for the making of Her, I am unable to expound on it in every detail, as St. Paul said, ‘It is impossible to speak of it in detail’. (23) After this, the Lord spoke to Moses and said to him ‘On the first [day] of the first month, set up the tabernacle and put my Ark inside the Mercy Seat where the Cherubim are protecting [it]. (24) And as for the book of the Commandments, which is the Tablet of the Law, deposit it in the womb of the Ark. In that place I will be revealed to you in My glory’. In the same way, he placed the Ark inside the tabernacle, and the tablet in the womb of the Ark. (25) And he covered Her with a curtain, which was the color of liver, as the Lord had commanded him. Then the tabernacle was filled with the glory of Lord. A column of cloud was over Her all the day, and the light of fire by night, before all the Israelites. Amsalu Tefera. 2015.

God then addressed Moses and told him to ascend Mount Sinai. When Moses arrived at the summit, God instructed him to remove his sandals. He then gave Moses the Tablet of the Law, each side of which contained writing that God had inscribed in ink of fire. Upon giving Moses the Tablet, God explained that the writing thereupon established His covenant with all Israelites. God said this to Moses, knowing that in the womb of Mary, who is Zion and the Ark of the Law, would come the one who would save all the faithful, who are Israelites. God then said to Moses that he had given instructions for the construction of the Tabernacle to two wise men, Baslʾel |sp| and Elyab |sp|. Moses descended from Mount Sinai and told the two wise men to begin their work. Basl’el and Elyab built the Tabernacle with lavish materials. They also fashioned the Mercy Seat, which bore images of two Cherubim whose wings extended to protect the Ark. On the first day of the first month, Moses placed the Tablet of the Law inside the Ark and the Ark inside the Mercy Seat.

And the tablet is the word of the Lord, who dwelt in Her womb, and was incarnated from Her. The Ark of the Law of the Lord, who is the celestial Zion, remained thus in great glory which could not be told until Moses had died. (27) After this, when the Israelites were going out and when they were marching around Jericho, the priests entered the Jordan (River) whilst carrying Zion and they stood in the middle of the river. (28) As for the water it stood still, and was not able to come down until all the Israelites had crossed. And [at that season] the water was [normally] full to its banks, the priests carrying Zion stood as if it were dry ground, (fully) dressed. (29) Then they took twelve stones from where the feet of the priests were standing, according to the number of the twelve tribes of Israel. After all the people had crossed, the priests carrying Zion departed. Then, the River Jordan became full to its banks as before. (30) And what the celestial Zion performed was on the 10th [day] of the month of Ǝbralyos, which is the month Qädaqya. All the children of Israel gave great praise and they glorified Our Lady, until they reached Jericho. (31) The Ark of the Law of the Lord went around the wall[s] of Jericho together with the priests and all the Israelites with a great shout. And then its walls fell down. They burnt the city with fire and left nothing inside it except the golden vessels which were to be for the house of the Lord. And She did great prodigies until She destroyed the people of Jericho and their cattle. (32) And also the people of Gay, Zion our Queen and Mother did great prodigies against them. And she killed all people, women and men, who were twelve thousand; these were all of the people of Gay. (33) And also the city, she burnt with fire and they became ashes. She made them such that no one could live in them until this day and this moment. She ordered the king of Gay to be hanged on a cedar tree, for the power of the Lord went with Her and angels paved Her road. (34) In this way, She continued many years to destroy many wicked kings.

494-B,Ark of Zion cycle: Part 6?: Continuation of the preceding Exhortation: The Ark of Zion crossing of the Jordan and the conquest of Palestine.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed,"(35) And now my fathers and brothers, encircle Zion and embrace the glory of Her feast while chanting. As for Her, She is adorned in the beauty of praise. She is more exalted than the heavens and She is more glorious than all the saints and the vigilant ones. Zion, the country of Immanuel, Our God. O Zion our mother, holder of dew of the divinity. (36) The bride of Lebanon, who is like the throne of the father of Rehoboam when he reigned over the horn of bondage, on which twelve fearsome lions were depicted. (37) What kind of honor is given to Her, and what kind of grace from the Father of the Light? (38) The Ark of our Law, Zion, our Lady, who was established before the world, in the mind of God, the Father, and by the favor of [His] only Son, and by the gift of the Holy Spirit, the Paraclete, [who are] co-equal in sovereignty, to be His dwelling, as the scripture says ‘For the Lord has chosen Zion and He has given precedence to Her to be His dwelling. I will dwell here for I have chosen Her and this is My resting place forever’. (39) Truly He chose and loved Zion and built His sanctuary in the Highest. And He watches over Her always with His angels. Her gates are not closed day or night. Those who abide within Her do not hunger, thirst, grieve nor weep. There is no sorrow within Her, only joy and gladness. There is no burning or coldness, no day or night, no moon, stars or sun which gives light within Her. (40) and she does not desire within Her anything under Heaven, nothing other than those saints who purified their garments with the Blood of the Lamb, who acquired Her by the effort of their struggle. (41) Those are they who carry palm branches. They sing (praises) as Moses, the servant of the Lord, praised in the canticle of the Lamb, while they stand in Her courts and in all Her paths, saying ‘Hallelujah, He who elevated Zion above all worlds; Hallelujah for Her who became the dwelling of His praise’. (42) ‘Hallelujah for Him one who sanctified the Sabbath and purified Her in order that all the angels, archangels, lords dominions, powers, thrones, tribunals, Cherubim, and Seraphim might greet Her’. They worship in the threshold of Her gates and He watches over Her with His might always and He illuminates her forever and ever with His light of Divinity which never sets. (43) Sometimes she is like an orchard whose fruits are many and more fragrant than all perfumes. Sometimes she is like the city of happiness. There are also times when she looks like the palace of a king. And sometimes she looks like the Ark and the Tablet with the Ten Commandments which are in Her womb. (44) As for Her, She is the one that the saints wish to see. Blessed are all those who stand within Her and sing Her praises. Blessed is the man for whom She became a mother when He was travelling and whom She received when He kissed Her door, as the prophet said ‘Blessed are all those who live on earth [and] let them praise you forever and ever’. Truly, the stars of Zion our mother ‡…‡ are praising the Lord. (45) Let us come back to the remaining matter which awaits us, concerning the story of Zion, who did miracles and wonders four hundred years after the children of Israel went out of Egypt, in the time of the prophesy of Samuel. When Eli because old, his sons who were priests were wicked and walked in the path of evil before the Lord. (46) The Lord was angered at the Israelites and made them fall before the Philistines and four thousand men died in battle in the desert. The surviving Israelites escaped and entered to their country and said ‘For what reason did the Lord make us to be given into the hands of the Philistines?’ (47) They did not know it was due to the sins of Eli and his sons’ evil deeds (that they perished). After this, they took the Ark of our God together with the image of the Cherub. And the two priests, the sons of Eli, Afnin and Finḥas, went to fight the Philistines. Then they cried out in the encampment when Zion reached them. (48) When the Philistines heard (this), they became afraid and said ‘Woe to us! Woe to us! For all the Hebrews have come with their God to wipe us out. Woe to us! Woe to us! Who shall save us from those who smote Egypt with many calamities?’ (49) But the hand of the Lord was with the Philistines to make war on them because of the sins of Eli and of his sons, the priests, who had made the sacrifice of our God unclean; and because they abused Zion. (50) After that, the Israelites fought against the Philistines and the Israelites were killed at the hands of the Philistines. The number of those who died on that day was 30,000 men. Afnin and Finḥas also died. And the Philistines took and captured the Ark. (51) A certain man from the battlefield ran to Eli, and he entered and told him that the Israelites had been destroyed and that his sons had died, and that they [Philistines] had carried off Zion. And Eli the priest, after hearing that the Ark was captured and everything that had happened, fell over backwards from his chair and died; for the hand of our God was heavy upon him. (52) Then the Philistines took the Ark and brought Her to the house of Dagon, their god, proclaiming ‘Dagon, our god is stronger than all’. (53) So, listen that I may speak to you, I who am weak in power, of stammering tongue and humble heart more than all [my] brothers, about the many prodigies, miracles and wonders that She performed upon Israel and the Philistines. (54) When the priests corrupted the Law of the Lord, she caused Israel to perish by the spear. Further, when they brought Her into the house of Dagon, the people of Azaṭon got up in the morning and found Dagon there fallen on his face before the Ark. They immediately raised him up and stood him up in his place in honor. (55) And the Lord became angry against them over Zion and He punished the people of Azaṭon and their territory with a great punishment. And when again in the morning they went into the house of Dagon, they found him fallen on his face at the feet of Zion, our Queen. His head was cut off, his two hands and his palms were fallen on the doorway. Nothing remained of him except his trunk. (56) On account of this astonishing miracle, there was much agitation, moaning and lamentation among the priests of Dagon. And they did not go up to sacrifice to him as was their custom. There was lamentation and wailing, and the hand of the Lord was heavy upon the people of Azaṭon. (57) And He brought [an infestation] to their country, (namely) mice in boats, which destroyed all. There was a terrible calamity which happened to this country. And they were shouting [and lamenting] by saying ‘Let the Ark of the God of Israel not remain with us, for Her hand is severe upon us and upon Dagon, our god’. (58) Hence, they sent to the lords of Philistines and assembled them and said to them, ‘What shall we do with Zion?’ Then the wise men, people of Get, said: ‘Let the Ark of the Lord be removed from us’. And they sent away Zion. (59) And then after they sent away Zion to the city, there was great shouting. He punished the people of that country: adult and child, man and woman. The people of Get made an image for those who were punished and they sent the Ark of the God of Israel to the city of Asqälona. (60) When they took Her [into Asqälona], they said ‘By what deed, by what matter and why did you leave Zion, the Ark of God of Israel, to us, for Her to kill us together with our people, our wives, our children and all our cattle?’ Then, they sent for the lords of the Philistines and gathered them. They said to them ‘Send away Zion so that She should dwell in to Her [own] place. (61) Let you send Zion to reign over Her [own] people and let Her not kill us with a bitter death’. For there was great punishment indeed in the country when Zion entered to them. Both the living and the dead were punished. The wailing of the city ascended unto heaven. Then they brought forth Zion to the desert and she dwelt there for seven months and She remained alone. (62) The end was worse than the beginning. When the Ark of the Lord our God sent out to the desert, their country was infested by mice as the land of Egypt had suffered with frogs during the Exodus of Israel. Likewise, their land was infested because of Zion. (63) During this time, the Philistines and people of Asqälona called the soothsayers and magicians and conjurers. They asked them, ‘What shall we do with Zion, the Ark of the God of Israel? Please tell us and advise us what to do with Her and in what manner we should send Her to Her country and Her place so that She should stay (there)’. (64) And the magicians, very zealous for Dagon their god, told them ‘Let Zion return to Her country and to Her people. And let us not send Her back alone and empty-handed but let Her sending be (accompanied) with much compensation’. (65) And the people said to the magicians ‘What is the compensation that She deserves? And what objects shall we cause to follow Her? As for us, we what have no fear nor sorrow at all about the objects of Her compensation. As for us, what we are deeply sorrowful about is the affliction that befell us because of Her and from Her’. (66) Then the magicians said ‘Let compensation be offered because you seized and captured Her. And do not return Her empty in order that She may be gracious to you. And let Her compensations be according to the number of the five lords of the Philistines. As she devastated your land by sending mice, then you must give many golden mice. And you must praise the God of Israel in order that He remove His hand from upon you and from upon your gods’. (67) However, when the people heard (this) they kept silent and were not willing to return Zion. Hence, they [the] declared to them again ‘Why should you harden your hearts as the Egyptians hardened their hearts against the release of the children of Israel?’ (68) When His hand was hardened over them, Pharaoh then sent them away and they departed. In the same way, you should return Zion and make Her new carts. Let you bring two cows, which have first-born. Let their calves remain at home. Then put those carts upon the cows and place the Ark in the carts. And make follow those golden objects after Her. (69) ‘Do not make Her a box into Her side, but you just dispatch Her in order to return Her to Her country’. And then they did as they ordered them. And they took two cows which had first-born and they shut up the house with their calves [inside]. They brought a cart[s] and they placed them upon the cows. Then they put Zion, the Ark of our Law, upon them, with the Ten Commandments in Her interior. (70) Moreover, they brought doves and mice and had them follow after Her. The cows went straight in the path, [without deviating] either to the right or to the left. And the five lords of the Philistines followed Her: the first of Azaṭon, the second of Get, the third of Aqaron, the fourth of Gaza and the fifth of [Asqälona] ‡…‡ [They brought five] golden mice according to their number of all their cities. And they proceeded until they reached [Betä] Samis. And that time was the harvest season. (71) The people of [Betä] Samis were reaping wheat. When they saw Zion, they rejoiced and exulted, and they welcomed and positioned Her together with the cart in the field. And the people of Betä Samis, those who welcomed Her, made a sacrifice there to the Lord, at that time. The cows, at that time ‡…‡. At this moment, great praise was done. And from there the priests welcomed Zion, the Ark of the Law of the God of Israel. (72) And they ‡…‡ over Her; and as for the golden objects, they caused them to accompany Her. Upon seeing this, the five lords, with their troops, returned to Asqälona saying ‘We have freed ourselves of Zion and have abandoned Her’. And at that time, when the sons of Ikonǝyu together with the people of [Betä] Samis looked upon Zion, they did not welcome Her; and She killed fifty thousand and seventy people. (73) Those who remained wept and said ‘The Lord has punished us because of Zion’. After She did that, the people of [Betä] Samis, said that ‘What shall we do with Zion and in which place should we put Her?’ Then, they sent messengers to those who live at Qaryat-(ye)arim saying ‘The Philistines have returned Zion the Ark. Come, welcome Her among you’. (74) Hearing this, they rejoiced, came, welcomed Her and brought Her to the house of Aminadab, which was on the hill. At that time, they sanctified Her and gave Her to Alʿazar to guard Zion and to become a priest. In this manner She lived a long time, for about twenty years. Amsalu Tefera. 2015.

He arose and went to bring Zion, the Ark of the Law of the Lord from where She was living to the house of Aminadab, for which He is called the Lord of power. (76) They brought Zion from there and took Her while a Cherub was hovering over Her. And ʿOza, the son of Aminadab, was leading Her while King David and all the Israelites were singing before the Lord with the lyre. They were playing with vigor and were singing with sistrum, bell and fiddle. They arrived at the threshing floor. (77) ʿOza raised his hand in order to take hold of Zion. And the cow threw ʿOza to the ground and he died at that time because he wanted to take hold of the Ark, which was not allowed. (78) And David grieved for the death of ʿOza and for Zion. David prayed ‘O Lord God, I am afraid because of Zion, your Ark, whom you dwell. How could She enter to me, with such a power following Her? Where shall I take Her and where shall She dwell?’ (79) After saying this, he brought Zion to the household of Abidara, the Gittite and She remained there for three months. Consequently, the house of Abidara was blessed by the entrance of Zion, by the command of the Lord. They told David that the household of Abidara and all that belonged to him was blessed because of Zion. (80) Hearing this matter, King David went to bring up Zion, the Ark of the God of Israel, to Her country with happiness. He brought Zion accompanied by a multitude of people [playing] with seven fiddles. And King David, was playing the lyre and leading [the multitude] saying ‘I have been made a king of Zion in the mountain of His sanctuary to declare the command of the Lord’. (81) And they brought Zion in with clamor and the sound of trumpets. They put Her in Her place in the inner side of the tabernacle, where David had established Her. And he offered a sacrifice to the Lord. He sacrificed cows and sheep for Her dedication. (82) And the wife of David, the daughter of Saul, having been envious of him when he was dancing to Zion, despised him in her heart and said: ‘From now on, he will not be my husband, for he is a king whom the girls of the city have seen dancing’.

Then they brought it to King Solomon, and the sons of Kiram and his (Solomon’s) own sons hewed it. In the fourth year, he built the house of the Lord, in the month of Nisan. (87) Its construction is like this: astonishing and marvelous to hear. Its length is forty cubits, its width is twenty cubits, its height is twenty-five; and the porch in front of the sanctuary is twenty cubits. He finished constructing the building and he made hidden windows. And he made an inner chamber (deep) inside in the middle of the house, [measuring] forty cubits from the sanctuary to the holy of holies, so that Zion, the Ark of the Lord, could dwell there. (88) He made two Cherubim above Zion. The height of the first Cherub was ten cubits; one of his wings was five [cubits], and the second was the same. Ten cubits were between them until their wings met. And the two were equal, and the nature of both was the same. They covered the Ark with their golden wings outside. As for Her interior, he caused to construct ‡…‡. (89) And the pavement of his house he inlaid with gold. As for the door-leaves he made them from pine wood and as for its columns (colonnades?) they were four and there were two door-leaves in one doorway and the same for the other. Their golden curtains were fitted one to another. (90) Furthermore, he made curtain[s] for the enclosure of the porch of the Holy of Holies. He erected two columns on the porch which is in the Sanctuary. He named the first Yaqum and the second Bäläz. And on the capitals of the pillars he made flowers which were four cubits. (91) He made a ‘sea’ there. He made the pole, which has twelve ornamented oxen under Her; [which are] looking in groups of three, towards the North, West, South and East; and their hinder parts were towards the wall. The sea was set on the top of them. As for the pedestals, they were ten of bronze, and in between, there were lions, oxen and Cherub(im). And ‡…‡ four wheels ‡…‡ [on] their shoulders [there were] lions and palm trees. (92) And he made ten lavers of bronze, named keṭrogawlos, each laver holding forty baths. Each [laver measured four cubits, with one pedestal for each laver]; and similarly for (all) ten pedestals. And he put them on the left side of the house. And as for the sea, it was on the right, eastward, towards the south. Amsalu Tefera. 2015.

Please do not think that this was like the construction of the palace of heaven where Holy Zion, who is our Holy Lady Mary dwells. [Rather,] he made it in [this] likeness according to the heavenly wisdom he was given. (94) As for its interpretation, it is like this: the two Cherubim are the twofold virginity of our Lady Mary, as John says about Her: ‘Her wings are two’. And the palm trees are the bed of the passion of the Lamb, who is the Cross. (95) The pavement of the Temple, covered with gold is the purity of the flesh of our Lady Mary. The two door-leaves of the one doorway of which he is speaking to you are the Law with the Gospel. The pinewood is the bishops who are appointed as the doors of the Church. The two pillars are Peter and Paul. The flowers of their capitals are the holy Faith. (96) As for the ‘sea’ which is within the house, on the right, eastward, towards the South is Baptism about which John preached for the remission of sin. The poles are the priests. The flowers of the palm trees are the faith of those who are baptized and the ritual of Baptism. (97) The twelve oxen which are with the sea are the twelve Apostles, who preached in the North, West, East and South. The ten united pedestals just like border are like the border of the Ten Commandments. The awesome lions which are in the middle are the prophets. The oxen are the apostles as we said earlier. The wheels of the carts with four shoulders in the four corners are images of the four beasts who bear the throne of God. (98) The ten lavers named keṭrogawlos, holding forty baths, this is the Law. The forty lavers, of which he is speaking to you, are the prophetical scriptures of the Prophets until Enoch. And in the same way the ritual of the temple of Solomon is being perfected in the ritual of the Holy Church. (99) I have written to you according to my ability because of [my] love for Her, Zion. If I only could, if I can, I would have interpreted all the rituals of the temple of Solomon. As for me, I did not learn scriptures like Paul from Gemaliel. I am a shepherd of sheep and goats and I am the least among all the brothers, and my sinful deed is as large as a Lebanese cedar. Amsalu Tefera. 2015.

All the troops who were following Her were praising, saying ‘Zion has returned to Her place’. They seated Her in the Sanctuary, under the wings of the Cherub(im). There was nothing on the inside of the Ark except the two tablets that Moses received from the hand of the Lord at Horeb. (103) The Temple was covered with the glory of the Lord. King Solomon rejoiced and said ‘Let the Lord God of Israel be blessed. Today is [the day] that He has spoken with His mouth and completed with His hands’. The King and all the Israelites offered a sacrifice to the Lord. (104) And Solomon made a feast on this day and he slaughtered twenty-two thousand oxen and a thousand of sheep (for) the consecration of the building of Zion and for the consecration of the house of the Lord.

I did not eat and I did not drink wine. I did not taste meat absolutely but only the fruit of a tree. (115) I prayed to the highest and said ‘O my Lord, who heard our fathers in the wilderness and desert and gave them your Law’. I prayed this and the like. (116) Then I saw with my eyes a woman on my right, who was weeping, mourning and wailing in a loud voice. She was suffering very much. Her clothes were torn and there were ashes on her head. Then I said to her ‘What makes you weep?’ And she replied to me ‘Leave me alone, and let me weep for myself’. Then, I asked her ‘What happened to you? Tell me’. And she said to me ‘I was barren for a long time, although I was with [my] husband for thirty years. And I prayed to the Most High, and after thirty years the Lord heard me, His handmaiden. He saw my sorrow and gave me one son. I was happy with him. When he reached manhood, I got him a wife and I prepared a wedding feast. But when he entered the [bridal] chamber, he fell down and died. (117) I wept very much and I came to this desert place alone. I did not eat food but I mourned for my only son, I replied to her and said ‘Your sorrow is done truly. We are also mourners and sorrowful, but you are sorrowful about your only son. Ask the earth and it will tell you’. I said to her ‘Do not do like this’. (118) Do you not see Jerusalem? Our Temple has been destroyed and our song has been abolished, our glory has been silenced and our teaching has fallen. Our lamps have been put out and our priests have been taken captive. The greatest [loss] of all, Zion has been sealed and Her glory passed away. So let you shake off your grief about your only son’. And as I was saying this to her, her face lit up like the sun and like the appearance of lightning. I was afraid to approach her and my heart was terrified. (119) When I looked at Her, She was not a woman, but like a city which was built up; its foundation was great and was very wide. Then I cried out and said ‘Where are you, Uriel, the angel, who came to me previously?’ Then he came to me that time while I was like the dead sleeping. He held me in his right [hand], raised me up and caused me to stand upright and said to me ‘why are you dismayed and why is your heart heavy?’ (120) I replied to him ‘When I saw this I become terrified. Only tell the interpretation of this to your servant’. He said to me ‘Listen and I will tell you; for the Most High revealed [this] to you when He saw your righteousness, because you are deeply sorrowful about Zion. And this is the matter. This woman whom you saw as a built-up city is Zion, who is at the right [hand] of the Most High, where she will be seated forever’. (121) And what She said to you, ‘I was barren for thirty years’: the world existed [for a long time] while there was no one who offered a sacrifice. And after 3000 years Solomon built the Temple. He sanctified [it], entered and offered a sacrifice, the son whom She bore. What She said to you ‘He fell down and died when he entered the [bridal] chamber, and I mourned’, is the fall of Jerusalem. (122) And what He showed you because of your pain and the sorrow in your heart over Zion—what He showed you was the light of Her praise and the beauty of Her dignity. As for you, do not be fear and do not be dismayed. Look to Her light and the strength of Her righteousness. And as best you can hear, listen with your ear to Her songs, for your sorrow is great about Her. (123) And [when] Uriel told me this matter, I rejoiced was glad over Zion, which was built by the right hand of the Most High, said Ezra. Amsalu Tefera. 2015.

In the eighth month, an angel came to me and raised me up from sleep like this. Then, I saw a lamp-stand with seven lamps and seven covers in which they place their hope in Her, with two olive trees to Her right and Her left’.

<p></p>
<p>There was a man by the name of Dêganâ, a builder of a church who worked wood and sculpted stone.</p>
<p>He was good in his new art in the town of Sakiyâ. He began to construct a church of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, Mother of God.</p>
<p>When he had finished constructing it, whoever saw it commended it and found it admirable.</p>
<p>Then he painted for it an admirable painting of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, Mother of God; a painting of the seven archangels; a painting of the 24 priests of heaven and a painting of the four Vivants; </p>
<p>A painting of all the armies of spiritual angels with the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit;</p>
<p>In the middle, a painting of the prophets and apostles and a painting of the just and the martyrs. He painted [these] on the four sides of the church.</p>
<p>Aksis, the king of Markadakyâ, learned of this. He came and saw that the holy church was decorated with the icon of Our Lady.</p>
<p>He ordered that they make Dêganâ come and said to him, “I rejoice over your subject; I am happy and rejoice over what you built, l these paintings, and all the works of your hands. Only do the same to the house of my gods.”</p>
<p>Dêganâ listened, he defended the faith and [tore into] beat the king, saying, “Your impure gods of wood and stone, of gold and silver, they have a mouth and do not speak; they have eyes and do not see; they have ears and do not hear; they have a nose and do not smell; they have hands and do not touch; they have feet and do not walk;  the aspect of their face is that of Satan.</p>
<p>“Dogs are worth more than them; while man sleeps, if there arises a thief or a savage beast, the dogs bark and wake their master.</p>
<p>“Your gods do not have power; what do they heal?”</p>
<p>The king was very irritated.</p>
<p>In the greatness of his fury, he gnashed his teeth; his molars fell to the earth with his saliva.</p>
<p>He ordered that Dêganâ be beaten and whipped with canes. God the powerful, who strengthened the martyrs in their fight, gave courage to Dêganâ; Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, Mother of Life , protected him.</p>
<p>The king said again to Dêganâ, “Bow before my gods.”</p>
<p>Dêganâ said to him, “I do not bow before impure things; me, I bow before the Son of the Virgin Mary, my God who created heaven and earth by His wisdom.”</p>
<p>Because of this, the king ordered again that Dêganâ be whipped with canes, until his bones came up, for seven days and seven nights.</p>
<p>But Dêganâ did not cease, neither in day nor night, neither evening or morning, to make mention of the name of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, Mother of Light,  [atypical not mother of God but of light]  and of God the powerful who gives courage to the martyrs in their fight.</p>
<p>The king said again to Dêganâ, “Is your body made of stone or iron? It does not suffer and (this treatment) does nothing to it.”</p>
<p>So he hurried to the prison so that they might enchain him for ten days and he ordered that he be whipped every day, 65 times with iron chains. God the powerful gave him courage, He who gave courage to the martyrs; Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, Mother of God, protected him, strengthened him and made him reach the haven of salvation.</p>
<p>The king had Dêganâ taken back out of prison, summoned him, and said to him, “Bow before my gods.” Dêganâ said to him, “Me, I do not bow before what is the work of the hands of men, nor, likewise, before what has the aspect of Satan. I bow, me, before the Son of Mary the Virgin who was and will be, who can resurrect the dead.”</p>
<p>The king gave an order to the executioner and this man cut off the head of Dêganâ. Milk [?!] and blood flowed from his neck and he received the crown of the martyr in the name of Jesus Christ and in the name of His mother, the Holy Virgin Mary.</p>
<p>The Lord God said to the soul of Dêganâ, “O pure, just as I created you, I found you. You did not make me ashamed and you did not neglect me; I, too, shall not neglect you.”</p>
<p>He gave him a white piece of clothing that was more brilliant than milk, whose nature is unknown, and girded him with a crown of light with the sign of the cross.</p>
<p>He dressed him [para, no direct object] all over in jewelry, in great honors and in the glory of the pure and elect soul, and said to him, “Go, enter into the Garden of eternal joy.”</p>
<p>When the armies of angels saw this, they rejoiced, made acclamations and said, “Glory to God in heaven and peace on earth, may His favor be for men!”  </p>
<p>The just in the Garden exalted and David plucked his harp so well that all the armies of angels felt a great joy by the prayer and intercession of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, Mother of Light. [Translation as of 05/21/22]</p>

[His wife] Elizabeth truly became a mother to me when my relatives died.  You also know that it has been six months since Zachariah entered the Temple, saw a vision, and has become unable to speak. I want to go to [see] Elizabeth. I am sad for her and her husband, for he is unable to speak.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Joseph replied, ""I too was thinking of going to [visit] him. Come, let us go together."" So, they went to [see] Elizabeth. </p>
<p></p>
<p>When Elizabeth heard that Joseph and our Lady, the Holy Two-fold Virgin Mary, the Mother of God, had come, she rose up quickly and received them. She embraced our Lady, the Holy Two-fold Virgin Mary, the Mother of God, and greeted her. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Then, Elizabeth became filled with the holy spirit. She announced loudly, ""Blessed are you among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb! Who am I that you, the mother of my Lord, should come to me? When I heard your voice in greeting, the child leapt joyfully and happily in my womb. Blessed are you [Mary,] who believe what you have been told from the [angel of the] Lord."" </p>
<p></p>
<p>When our Lady, the Holy Two-fold Virgin Mary, the Mother of God, heard this, she knew that the holy spirit had spoken through Elizabeth. She recalled the angel’s words. Then, she too became filled with the holy spirit and announced loudly, </p>
<p>""My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord;  </p>
<p>“My spirit rejoices in God, my savior. </p>
<p>“He has looked with favor on his lowly servant. </p>
<p>“From this day forward, all generations will call me blessed. </p>

<p>“Holy is His name! </p>

<p>“He has cast down the mighty from their thrones. </p>
<p>“He has lifted up the lowly. </p>
<p>“He has filled the hungry with his blessings. </p>
<p>“He has sent away the rich naked. </p>
<p>“He has received Israel, his young servant. </p>
<p>“He has remembered the mercy he spoke of to our Fathers Abraham and his descendants for ever."" </p>
<p></p>
<p>Zachariah’s neighbors heard [all] this. [While] Joseph marveled in silence [at what he had heard Mary say], the neighbors approached him. Joseph beckoned to them with his hands and they came closer. Then, Joseph blessed them. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Then, Joseph returned to his land. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Our Lady, the Holy Two-fold Virgin Mary, the Mother of God, stayed with Elizabeth  for she loved her. They talked with one another about the angel’s words and Zachariah’s prophecy.  They stayed together for three months until Elizabeth gave birth. </p>

528,Saint Mary helps Emperor Naˀod humble the Jews.,,"<p>Listen brothers, to what happened in our time when the enemy Satan wanted to fight against the saints.  </p>
<p>Those disbelievers, the bitter [Ethiopian] Jews,  are “the small foxes who destroy our vineyard,”  and their appointed teachers are soldiers of wickedness. </p>
<p>For the sake of her Covenant [with Ethiopia], Our Lady Mary appointed Emperor Naod on the throne of his father  [Baeda Maryam I] so that he might take revenge against the Jews. She became his help and his refuge.  </p>
<p>She revealed a mystery to our Emperor Naod in front of the Jews when he [conquered and] humbled them in their own city. </p>
<p>Due to their immense cursedness and intense madness, they said to him in public, “God was not born of Our Lady Mary!” </p>
<p>Because of his burning love for her, the emperor became enraged at them, like the zealously zealous Elijah, who killed some of the Jews with a spear, cut some of them with a sword, burnt some of them with fire, and tortured some of them with imprisonment. He subjected them to inquisition in the court of accusations, [to their] humiliation and shame, [while they stood in] nakedness and wretchedness. </p>
<p>Emperor Naod did all this for the sake of Our Holy Lady Mary’s Covenant [with Ethiopia] and her honor. He destroyed those wolves who were found among his flock. [So much so that] you will not find them [together now]. They are dispersed all over the place like roadside dust by the power of her Covenant [with Ethiopia] and the divine power of her praised son. </p>
<p>Because of Emperor Naod’s zeal, he did  this, [persecuted the Jews,] throughout his reign, until he came to forgetful old age, guarded by her son’s powerful divine power. </p>
<p>May her prayers and supplications save him [the patron Walda Giyorgis,] from Satan's snare, in his leaving and returning with all his troops. </p>
<p></p>
<p>All you evangelical Ethiopians, listen up. </p>
<p>Our country Ethiopia is the holy hall for the Lord. The Father shaded [Mary] and established her and his Son was [born] from her and the Holy Spirit came down to sanctify her. </p>
<p>Our country is an inheritance for her, as Gregory of Armenia said when he spoke to the [318 Bishops at the] Council of Nicaea [in 325]. </p>
<p>Giyorgis the priest from the region of Sägla [in Ethiopia] wrote in his Book of Mystery about Ethiopia’s honor and glory. </p>
<p>David the prophet said about her glory, “Ethiopia will stretch out her hands to the Lord her creator.” He prophesied this about our country Ethiopia, which believed in the news about Mary’s son Jesus, without any Apostle coming to preach to her. It is because of this [belief] that Our Lady Mary loved our country Ethiopia and made Ethiopia her own portion, like Galilee, Nazareth, and the Land of Ephrata [in Israel]. It is because of this that she does mighty works in Ethiopia through her prayers and supplications. </p>
<p>May [her prayer and supplication] be with her servant Wäldä Giyorgis and his mother Wälätä Mikael, forever and ever. Amen.[Translation as of 05/21/22]</p>

529,Saint Mary assists the emperors of Ethiopia.,,"<p>Through her Covenant [with Ethiopia], [Our Lady Mary] performed miracles for kings, who were enthroned in [their] love for her; bishops, who preached about her Covenant [of Mercy] and her giving birth [to God];  priests and deacons, who served her in goodness; and monks and all the Christians who adhere to orthodoxy. Primarily, [she performed in] Aksum, the mother of nations, just like Jerusalem. </p>
<p>Through her Covenant [with Ethiopia, Our Lady Mary performed miracles] for Abunä Sälama [that is, Frumentius,] and all the venerable bishops who came after him. For Abrǝha and Aṣbǝha, and all the Ethiopian kings who came after them, she was their aid and they loved her. </p>
<p>In this world, she fought the kings’ foes and enemies, enthroning them in righteousness. In the next world, she bestowed on them the heavenly kingdom. </p>
<p>Through her Covenant [of Mercy], Our Lady Mary, the Holy Virgin, always does miracles for good bishops and orthodox kings. For clerics, monks, and all Christians, men and women [alike], she does miracles. </p>
<p>[She does miracles] in [other] churches in Təgre [not just Aksum], in [the town of] Angot in Amhara, in Däbrä Libanos in Shäwa, and everywhere in Ethiopia where her churches are built, her name is invoked, her covenant is commemorated, and all her other feasts are celebrated. </p>
<p>When they pray to her earnestly,  she does what they want. To some, she has appeared in dreams when they asked her. To others, she has appeared visibly [in the world]. To some, she has appeared during difficult and sorrowful times. She heals the sick and guards the traveler from all ordeals. She brings the sailors into safe harbor. She does these and many other things like them. She performs all these miracles and wonders for all the saints through her Covenant [of Mercy]. For she can perform miracles. </p>
<p>There is not enough paper in the world to write all the miracles she has done, as [the Apostle] John says.  Because of this, I have written only a few of Our Lady Mary’s miracles of her Covenant [of Mercy and] so that they might not be forgotten. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Now, listen to Our Lady Mary Covenant’s miracle which she did in the sanctuary of Ṣana where this book of her covenant was written in that the ancient time. </p>
<p>When Our Lady Mary bore in her virginity, when she fled from Herod, so that Herod might not kill the child, it is said that she reached in this island named Ṣana. She also said, when I was wandering from place to place the angel Gabriel came and took me to the seashore. Then, he divided the sea and took me inside to where kind people were living. He let me live with them for three months. I asked, “Where are you from?” They replied, “We are from the 9 tribes whom the Lord brought to this good place during the time of Achab.” </p>
<p>“I too wanted to live with you,” [Our Lady Mary said]. </p>
<p>But, the angel came and took me from there. He said, “Go back to your country.” </p>
<p>She didn’t say what the name of that sea was. God only knows if it was another sea [than Ṣana]. Because of this, it is said, Our Lady Mary came to the island with her son. Nothing is impossible for her son. Our ancestors told us that they were on this island. Because of her Covenant to this island, Our Lady Mary brought Abrəha and Aṣbəha to build the church of Ṣana. These kings are righteous. When they reached there, they built the church and constructed the Ṣana sanctuary with Our Lady’s help for the sake of her Covenant. For its commencement the kings brought a bishop and he ordained priests and deacons to serve the church. </p>
<p>Again, two other kings [one after another] renewed the church of Ṣana with Our Lady Mary’s help in their reigns. Fourth, loving Our Lady’s Covenant, King Yəshaq̣ built the church of Ṣana. He adorned it with many adornments as you can see. [He also prepared] the compound for priests and monks. Fifth, Zärʔa Yaʔq̣ob ordered three magistrates to build the ceiling, as the [other] kings had done before. </p>
<p>It was Our Lady who stirred the hearts of all these kings to build the church of Ṣana. For she loves it. For she came to the island with her child. For the sake of her Covenant, she guards those who are appointed to minister there as their mother, a woman named Kərstos Sämra. She said, “Our Lady Mary appeared to me many days with her son and his angels.” Another saint from Ṣana also said, “When I was sick, Our Lady Mary appeared to me on her feast day in the likeness of a noble woman and anointed me with healing. I was healed from my disease when I wrote what Our Lady Mary did through her Covenant.” My dear fathers and brothers, now, you have heard what Our Lady Mary did, through her covenant, to the Cannibal who gave water in her name to the thirsty and to the one who gave bread and blood in her name to the hungry. She saved them from the fiery Gehenna and gave them eternal life. She does the same to all who call upon her name, as it is written in the book of her miracles. </p>
<p>Because of this, celebrate the memorial feast for the Mother of Light in incense and Eucharistic Liturgy while feeding the hungry, giving drink to the thirsty, and clothing the naked with your money in this world so that she might save you from the war of Satan in the coming World.

[There] he found a beautiful location that delights the human heart.  </p>
<p>And he said, “In this location, a place of worship for Christians would be desirable.”  </p>
<p>And he selected a pleasing [plot of] land and wanted to build on it [the place of worship]. He contemplated this in his heart, and he said, “As for me, I want to construct a chapel for our Holy and Pure Lady Mary, Two-fold Virgin, the mother of light, the queen of the utmost, in this pleasing land.”  </p>
<p>And when he looked out each morning toward the east and the west, [he found] his location was  more desirable and pleasing than the wilderness, verdant and fertile [in a way] that delights the human heart. And that Aramawi marveled in his heart and he considered [things] and then called out her name, the name of our Holy and Pure Lady, Mary, Two-Fold Virgin, mother of light, queen of the utmost, and he addressed her, “You, mother of my Lord, Jesus Christ, the creator of all!” And he stayed there many days while longing to build a church in the name of our Holy and Pure Lady, Mary, Two-Fold Virgin, mother of light, queen of the utmost, and he stayed there many days saying so. And while he was saying those worthy things, that Aramawi died.   </p>
<p>The angels of darkness came, and they surrounded him and they took his soul. But, Our Holy and Pure Lady, Mary, Two-Fold Virgin, mother of light, queen of the utmost, she came while searching for a reason. And Our Holy and Pure Lady, Mary, Two-Fold Virgin, mother of light, queen of the utmost said to the angels of darkness, “leave that soul alone.” </p>
<p>And the angels of darkness, said to her, “What did that Aramawi do for you?” </p>
<p>And Our Holy and Pure Lady, Mary, Two-Fold Virgin, mother of light, queen of the utmost, spoke to her beloved son, Jesus Christ, “Show mercy on my behalf.”</p>
<p>And Our Lord, said to her, “What has he done for you?”</p>
<p>And our Lady said, “He selected a beautiful location in order to build a sanctuary in my name, that Aramawi, who desired good in his heart.” </p>
<p>And our lord Jesus Christ said to his mother, “[Regarding] the one who loved you, I gave you the gift of admitting people to heaven. So, let it happen.” And he showed mercy on her behalf to that Aramawi, and Our Holy and Pure Lady, Mary, Two-Fold Virgin, mother of light, queen of the utmost, took his soul and settled it in the garden of rejoicing, where there is rejoicing and joy.  </p>
<p>This miracle [of Mary] has [now] been revealed.  </p>
<p>May the blessing of her prayer and the giving of her help be with her servant Walda Giyorgis forever and ever amen. </p>

<p>About a good man who decides he can do better. So, you can’t just be nice to Mary and think it is enough and go to heaven,]</p>
<p>[Mehari says name not common in Ethiopia either, but high priest at time of David, and vocabulary is very rare, not in dictionaries, and words are not Arabic derviative]</p>
<p>[Wendy thought a story from Nubia, lots of new/odd vocab may be one sign. Check Arabic but perhaps Old Nubian. But not likely, seems Ethiopian. Arabic speaker maybe, coming with the Egyptian patriarch? Tigrinya? Arabic speakers shaped a lot of Gz literature. Know enough to quote Song of Songs but not to have the right word for horse ][blank space for stanzas, and no dedication but a blank for the patron]</p>
<p>[Song of Song 5:16 allusion] </p>
<p>And there was a certain monk whose name was Abyatar [Abiathar] in the town of Noba [Nubia?) who loved our Lady, the Holy Two-fold Virgin, Mary, Mother of God. </p>
<p>And he beautified her sanctuary, and he swept the courtyard for any grass and branches that had fallen. And he made a trumpet/drum. And he would sell to whomever he liked, taking the proceeds and handing them to the poor so that they might turn a [heavenly] profit for him. And he [also] would give fine linen garments and embroidered garments  to our Lady, the Holy Two-fold Virgin, Mary, Mother of God. </p>
<p>And one day, our Lady, the Holy Two-fold Virgin Mary, Mother of God came to Abyatar while he was beautifying the trumpet/drum for her church. And she spoke to him with her voice, which is sweeter than the trumpet/drum of heaven and is the delight that refreshes the heart that hears it and that tastes sweeter to the throat than the honeycomb of new honey and the vineyard wine. [Song of Song 5:16 allusion, Septuagint, doesn’t get revised with the Arabic, knows the Psalter] </p>
<p>And she announced everything to him, and she revealed to him [She’ol,] the place where sinners will be judged and [heaven,] the place where the saints will rejoice in the garden.  </p>
<p>And immediately, Abyatar grieved for the sake of his soul and he chastised his soul.  And  he said, “As for me, I was raised like a headstrong horse [faras] and like the farm animals that attend only to the grass for their bellies. I have carried out the entirety of my life in futility, [wearing] glorious clothes and [eating] good food. But now death and She’ol await me.”  </p>
<p>And he gave [away] the trumpet/drums that he had made on the day of the feast of our Lady, the Holy Two fold Virgin, Mary, Mother of God, and he rejected this fleeting world and trampled it like a muddy plot of land. And then he went out into the wilderness for the sake of the love of our Lady, the Holy two-fold, Virgin Mary, Mother of God and he remained there for fifteen years while pleasing her with fasting and prayer. </p>
<p>Then he died and three lions buried his corpse at the command of our Lady the Holy Two-Fold Virgin, Mary, Mother of God. And she received his soul with the trumpets/drums of the spirit while the angels entertained him. And she settled him in the eternal garden. </p>
<p>May her blessings be with us, amen. [Translation as of 05/21/22]</p>

And again the apostles ordered that her commemoration be made in the month of Ayar,  so that through her prayers, birds will not eat the fruit of the Earth, nor pests nor black worms nor wingless flies will lay waste to the fruit of the Earth, nor will there be famine among men. Then the Holy Spirit said to the apostles: “I say to you all, locusts will come in the blink of an eye  over the land which the Lord wishes to send a plague in his wrath.” Immediately after, the apostles ordered that supplications be made in the month of Ayar and that humans pray to the Lord so that they would be saved from calamity. And the apostles again ordered humans to make commemoration to Mary on the seventeenth day of the month Nahase,  on account of the fields and fruits of the vine and the trees which bear fruits. And the apostles also ordered, to those who want to bring offerings, to carry in the evening flour and wheat to be kept pure in  the church until morning. And they also ordered the priests to pray over them saying: “Oh Mother of God, hear their prayers, they who make commemoration in your name, accept this sacrifice, which they have offered to you.” And while the priests pray thusly, Mary mother of light will come and will bless this sacrifice and those who accept in faith the eucharist from this table, into eternity, amen.  </p>

617,"Mary, Dormition/Dormition/Assumption of cycle: When the Jews try to seize Saint Mary and the Apostles in Bethlehem, they are taken by the Spirit to the Temple, the house being left empty.",,"<p>In that hour, the magistrates  and older men of the temple came to Bethlehem, and after summoning those who had been healed by Mary, they questioned them, saying, “Tell us what Mary did to you all.” To this they [those who had been healed] responded and said, “When Mary prayed over us, a great power  went out from her, and we were healed from our illnesses.” And after the Jews heard these words, their eyes darkened, and their priests were afraid, and the magistrates were dismayed, and they said in a loud voice, “See how because of Mary, a great sadness and affliction and crisis has come over us.” And they said: “Expel Mary out of Bethlehem at once, do not allow that woman to stay among you.” And after doing so during the day, the Jews came to the house of Mary that evening in order to arrest the disciples with Mary. But when they reached the home of Mary, they could not enter, because in that moment the doors of Heaven were thrown open and a great light emerged: then they were transported back amongst the magistrates and the priests, and they told them what had come forth. Then they ordered the governor  to go with thirty soldiers, and to arrest Mary and the disciples. But then, the Holy Spirit descended over the apostles and said to them: “Look, the governor comes with thirty soldiers from Jerusalem, so that he can arrest you, then the disciples, and then Mary. But leave this place now, and do not fear: behold, I will make you travel over the sky and the land through the aether,  so that he [the governor] will not be able to see you, because the power of the Lord is with you.” Then the disciples left, carrying Mary’s bed, and behold--the Holy Spirit came, carrying them, and led them away to Jerusalem. Then the governor came with his soldiers to Mary’s home, and when he had gone inside, he found no one there. Truly, that governor became fiercely angry, and he said to the inhabitants of Bethlehem: “Did you not come to the magistrates and make them aware that Mary, with great glory, was here among the disciples of Jesus, while the angels of the Lord arose and descended to the house of Mary? Now really, come to the magistrates in order to tell them what you wish.” And they left with them, traveled to Jerusalem, and spoke with the magistrates, saying, “After we entered Bethlehem, we did not find Mary, or the disciples, or anyone.” The priests told them: “Do you not know that the disciples had laid an enchantment, did you not see with your eyes? Now that you have heard this report about them, arrest them and bring them to us.” Five days after this, the citizens of Jerusalem saw the angels of the Lord entering Mary’s home and left at once; then, her neighbors gathered, shouting and saying, “Oh Mary, holy Mother of God, in you we hope, pray to Christ that he might give us his full blessing.” The next day, the priests went off to speak to Mary’s neighbors and said to them, “What is this clamor, what is this wailing that we hear among you all?” Responding, they said, “Behold, Mary Mother of God entered her home and the angels of the Lord sang hymns in her presence.” Then the priests approached the governor and told him: “Look how great the havoc and the tumult in the city of Jerusalem around Mary is.” The governor responded and said, “Well, what shall we do?” The men in Jerusalem responded and told him, “Let us take up fire and torch and let us burn down her home where she lives.” The governor responded and said, “Do what you want.” And afterwards, the men of Jerusalem took up fire and torch so that they could burn the house where Mary was staying; and then, they went into her home and began to shut the door of her house. But on that very spot, an angel of the Lord emerged and struck their bodies, and all of them were consumed by flame, those men who came to the door of Mary’s house. And a great many were killed there, and a great terror spread in Jerusalem. The governor, seeing this omen, raised his hand to the sky and said, “Glory be to the son of God, who was born from the Virgin Mary; I praise him, I celebrate him, I adore him, for time without end.” [Translation as of 05/21/22]</p>",,"Miracle of Mary: When the Jews try to seize St Mary and the Apostles in Bethlehem, they are taken by the Spirit to the Temple, the house being left empty.",,"Apostles; Bethlehem; Houses, homes; Holy Spirit; Spirit; Jews, opponents of Saint Mary; Magistrates; Officials; Temple of Solomon; Transitus miracles",,16,4,0,LIT5595MMBethlehem,,,CAe 5595,"Chaîne, Apocrypha, p. 36:21.",,,617,,1,1,2,"Z-Paris (BNF) 53, Z-Paris (BNF) 54",ወበይእቲ፡ ዕለት፡ መኳንንት፡ ዘቤተ፡ ልሔም፡ ጸውእዎሙ፡ ለእሙንቱ፡ ዕደው፡ እለ፡ ተፈወሱ፡ እምደዌሆሙ፡ ኀበ፡ እግዝእትነ፡…. ተስዕልዎሙ፡ ወይቤሎሙ፡ ንግሩነ፡ ዘገብረት፡ መንክረ፡ ለክሙ፡ እግዝእትነ፡ ማርያም,,,,,FALSE,,,,"Mary, Life: Dormition",,,No,Life of Mary,Elliot Galvis,Translation of a translation,,,,617,,,,,,"When the Jews try to seize Saint Mary and the Apostles in Bethlehem, they are taken by the Spirit to the Temple, the house being left empty.",Yes,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,Yes,No,617,,,,,,,1500,1550,,,"The magistrates and temple priests came to Bethlehem and asked those who had been healed by the Virgin Mary to tell their story.

618,"Mary, Dormition/Dormition/Assumption of cycle:The governor believes in Christ and rebukes the Jews (continuation of the preceding miracle).",,"<p>The next day, the governor sent a message to the assembled priests and all the men in Jerusalem, and said to them. “Evil men, you crucified Christ, who descended from heaven on behalf of a message concerning all of humankind. I truly believe in him, and I do not come from among you, nor am I a man from your region, but King Tiberius made me governor over you because of your evil deeds. Behold, from this hour, I say to you all, let no one in any way approach the home of the holy and blessed Mary.” Then arose a man of faith, whose name was Caleb, who held faith in Christ and spoke in secret to the governor, and said, “Oh governor, command them with this oath: ‘by the living God, who led the brothers of Israel out of Egypt, and by the sacred law of Moses’ (so they will not swear falsely but will only speak truly); after [you say this], they will say that it is Christ, born from Mary, who is the prophet, whether the son of God or some man who might be born from copulation–they will respond precisely to you. For I know that they are wise men, and they can make known the word of the holy Book.” Then the governor stood up, and sitting on a high throne, summoned all the congregated men of Jerusalem and commanded them by the oath which Caleb had indicated. He said to them, “Oh men of Israel, I beseech you through the sacred law of Moses: divide yourselves, those who believe in Christ, who was born from Mary, and those who do not believe in him.” And hearing this, they all separated one from the other, with the greatest fear. The governor spoke and said to them: “Do you believe in Christ, who was born from Mary, or do you not believe?” And the elders said to the governor: “We believe in him, he who is the son of the Lord, who created Heaven and the Earth and everything in them.” But others who did not believe said to the governor, “We know that the arrival of Christ is not near.” The lovers of Christ responded and said, “Did our father Adam not order his son Seth, before he died, saying thusly, ‘Look, the sacrifice and offering of treasures are placed in a den, gold, frankincense, and myrrh, which the Magi offer to the son of man born in Bethlehem.’” The infidels, who did not believe, responded and said: “Is Christ greater than Abraham, for whom the Lord laid bare the heavens and with whom he spoke?” The lovers of Christ responded and said: “Truly, you all are infidels destitute of wisdom; nevertheless, we truly believe with certainty that that man who was born from Mary is the creator of the whole universe; before Abraham was created in the womb of his mother, before the whole creation, Christ existed.” The infidels said, “Do you believe that Christ is more honored than Isaac, who was a willing sacrifice to the Lord?” And the lovers of Christ responded, “If Isaac had been sacrificed, he would be called the only sacrifice, but truly [that man] was the figure of the Son. And Christ was nailed on the wood of the cross as an offering for the whole world, and thus through him, the world approaches the Lord.” The infidels who did not believe said: “Is Christ greater than Jacob, who saw the ladder of Heaven and the angels ascending and descending by this ladder?” The lovers of Christ said: “The angels and ladder which Jacob saw in the middle of Heaven and Earth are prophets of the arrival of Christ.” The infidels who did not believe said: “Is Christ greater than Elias, who ascended into Heaven after God favored him and all of his works?” The lovers of Christ said: “Elias certainly went above the sky which is under Heaven, where the sun and moon appear: truly when Elias ascended to Heaven, no one honored him. Not even the servant of Elias. But when Christ ascended above the heavens, all creatures, those in Heaven and on Earth, adored him.” The infidels said: “Is Christ greater than Moses, who drowned Pharaoh and his soldiers in the sea and made the waves hold back like walls on this side and that side, and [who] saved the sons of Israel?” The lovers of Christ said: “Did Christ not defeat demons and drown them in the sea? And did he not also raise his hand and save Simon Peter from the wave of the sea? For he had power over all creatures, those on earth and those in the sea.” After hearing these things, the governor believed in Christ and ordered the forty men who did not believe to be whipped with a great lashing.</p>
<p>        When evening arrived that day, in the time when the rooster crows, the governor approached Mary with his two sons. And look, one of the eldest of the sons was ill, and after he had approached and struck the door of Mary’s house, one of the virgins who was ministering to Mary came out, and the governor said to her: “Speak of me to the holy Virgin.” But listening, sacred [Mary] ordered the doors of the home to be thrown open. The governor, weeping, approached her and said to her: “Oh Mother of God, I say blessings to you and to Christ who was born from you, and blessings to Heaven where he keeps his throne of power. Look, from this hour, I will worship you and believe in Christ who was born from you; raise your hand and bless me, oh Mother of light, pray for my son so that he may be healed from illness; pray also for the city of Rome. Pray for me, so that I may depart from this Earth saved, and after I will walk to see my parents.” Then raising her hand, the holy virgin blessed [him] and said to him: “Sit here.” But when the governor had seen the apostles standing around Mary, he prostrated himself at their feet and said to them: “Greetings to you all, blessed of God, those whom he himself chose through his will, so that you may be mentioned first in his name throughout the whole world.” And then the apostles blessed the governor, and his son was healed on the spot. And he went out into his Roman state, and proclaimed to many [people] everything that he had seen around Mary. Then the disciples of Paul went to him. Truly, from him they wrote all of the wonders and miracles, which were done over those who invoked the name of Mary. [Translation as of 05/21/22]</p>

That evening the governor and his sons approached Mary’s home. The governor asked for an audience with Mary, and the Holy Virgin welcomed him in.

Mary blessed the governor and invited him to sit. But when he looked up and saw the apostles there, he prostrated again and greeted them with blessings.

And he lived thus a long time without anyone among the Christian peoples knowing this [about him].  </p>
<p>One day he came toward the church on the day of the Sabbath in order to receive the Eucharist, pretending to be a Christian. This was an heretical thought, lacking in faith, the child of destruction, and deceitful of heart. When he entered the church, he stood among the priests disguised like a good person, a man who had no wickedness. </p>
<p>But when the icon of Our Lady, holy two-fold Virgin, Mary, mother of God, saw Agabos standing among the priests, it wept. When the many people [there] and the priests saw this, they were terrified. So they performed a great prayer while they carried that icon of Our Lady, holy two-fold Virgin, Mary, mother of God. And when they carried that icon, from which tears poured again from its eyes, it spoke with its voice: “Drive out from among you Agabos, my enemy and the enemy of my Son, and crucify him this very day because he is not a Christian. And when I saw him among you, I hated him and tears poured from my eyes because he eats the flesh of the Jews [i.e., non-Christian others] and the flesh of my Son [during Communion]. Crucify him, crucify him now!” </p>
<p>And, at once, they seized Agabos and they crucified him and once they had crucified them, they performed the communion.  </p>
<p>And again, the icon of Our Lady, holy two-fold Virgin, Mary, mother of God, spoke and it said to the priests of the land of Dalga, “O priests of my church, may your prayers be accepted and may your incense and communion be pleasing because you crucified Agabos, my enemy and the enemy of my Son.” And while speaking [this], our Lady Mary blessed them. </p>

John closed her eyes, while Peter and Paul arranged her hands and feet. The Holy Spirit dressed her in brilliant light. The Apostles then lifted Mary and raised her to Paradise on twelve clouds of light. Anna, the mother of Mary, and Elisabeth, the mother of John the Baptist, appeared, as did many others: Adam, Seth, Noah, Shem, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Enoch, Elijah, and Moses, and after them the chariots of our Lord Jesus Christ.

627,Holy Family in Lebanon: Part 3: The prayer of King Demateyanos.,,"<p>She told him all what the angel said to her that night. At midnight, Dematyanos stood and raised his eyes “O Lord the God of Israel listen to my prayer. May my groaning come before you. I call you at this difficult hour because of the departure of Our Lady Mary. If I leave her to go, she and her child will die in the hands of Herod. Their blood will be on me. If I forbid her, I am afraid that she will be angry at me. Reveal to me, Lord, what is better for her and what is better for me.”  He prostrated 40 times and tears flowed from his eyes.</p>
<p>Immediately, the angel Uriel descended to him and said “May the peace of the Lord be with you. Your sorrow, groaning and commemoration has reached God.”</p>
<p>“Let Our Lady go to Bethlehem. From there she will pass to Egypt so that the word of God which said ‘I called my son out of Egypt’ might be fulfilled.”</p>
<p>Again the angel said “O Dematyanos, you have received great grace and a lot of blessing.” The angel showed Dematyanos the cross in his hand and said “Make like this to win over your enemies.”</p>
<p>Having said this the angel ascended to heaven.</p>
<p>In the morning, Dematyanos went to Holy Mary. He bowed down before her and said “Go wherever you want.” Then, he offered her the gifts [he brought with him]. She said “May the Lord give you good!” But she refused to accept. She said “Go to your country and give it to the poor and the wretched so that you might find treasure [in heaven].”</p>
<p>He bowed down and said “Take my Lady, let it be your provision for the road.”</p>
<p>She said “Truly, I am telling you Dematyanos that my heart doesn’t desire it at all. I do not seek gold and silver. If I am saved from Herod, this would have been as a gift for me.”</p>
<p>When he heard this, Dematyanos became very sad. He left Our Lady Mary. He climbed his chariot and went a day’s journey before her all the way to Mount Tona from where one can see the Land of Judea.</p>
<p>Our Lady Mary turned around and cried saying “Peace be upon you, mountains of Lebanon which give good fruit and bloom sweetness. Peace to you, the daughters who live on the mountains of Lebanon. Come cry over me for I am going to die in destruction.”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Dematyanos cried bitterly. Joseph and Salome also cried.</p>
<p>Dematyanos said to Our Lady Mary “If I return you back to my country, I am afraid that I will anger God. If I leave you to go, my heart is burning with your love. Again, I am afraid because of Herod. For I know that he is roaring like a lion for murder. What can I say about you? But I tell you one thing: if Herod searches out for you, send one of your people. I will come to you. If the God of Israel gives me I will plunder the entire Judea, Jerusalem, all the way to Msr and Egypt,  Zebulun and Naphtali, all the way to Hasiebon. I am going to kill, not just the people and animals. Rather, I will raze their trees; and I am not going to leave any grass standing. I will make it into ashes. I will plunder their cities.” When she heard this her heart became consoled from sadness. They stayed that night together. In the morning they greeted one another. Dematyanos returned to his country in sadness because of Our Lady Mary. May the prayer of Giegar the Martyr, the reward of the love of Dematyanos the humble one and the beloved of Queen Mary be with her servant Gebre Maryam forever and ever. Amen.            </p>

After this, they sent for her relatives here, while asking me that I might come and see her the next day, for they were my friends and companions. They saw her and asked her about what she found. And she responded to me and said to me: “I cannot speak about everything I saw” and I seized her to make her tell me a little about what she saw, and from the greatness (of the grabbing) she grabbed me to tell me with humble words.

639,The heir who planned to terminate his father's custom of a monthly feast in honor of Saint Mary.,,"<p>There was a certain man in the city of Alexandria and he was performing Our Lady’s commemoration, in [honor of] how she conceived and birthed the savior of the world, on the 29th of each month. [On that day,] he would give 33 denari to the poor, apart from the anointing of oil, which he placed upon their heads, which made them greatly happy, and he sent them out in peace. And he lived in this manner for many years.</p>
<p>And when the time of his rest grew near, he commanded his son and recommended to him, saying “Know your commitments. Do not cease from performing the feast of our Lady Mary on the 29th of each month. Because on [the 29th is] the annunciation of Gabriel and also on it she gave birth to our savior Jesus Christ. As for me, I found a lot of grace because of this [commemorating].” And after saying this to him, he died in peace.</p>
<p>And that son lived a full year performing the commemoration of the feast of the Mother of light when it was the 29th of each month, but in the second year heresy/doubt entered into the heart of that son.</p>
<p>And he thought to himself, “if I continue being subject to this deed, then my money will disappear and my forefather’s inheritance/toil. [will be lost to me] And I will become the one who is receiving charity before I die.”</p>
<p>He determined in his heart to cease performing her feast. And on that night, our Lord Jesus Christ appeared to him in the likeness of a luminous man. And he said to him, “Behold/look, I will show you tightness of chest [i.e., make you anxious] concerning a little bit of charity which you will give because of your forefathers. Do you not know that everything that you give charitably, it is I who am receiving it from you?”</p>
<p>He said to him, “Who are you, my Lord? Because your speech is very eloquent, and it reinvigorated all my bones. I beseech you to tell me your name and what I should do so that I might be saved from this grief which [now] surrounds me?”</p>
<p>And our Lord responded to him and said, “If you want to know my name, then I will make it known to you. I am the son of God, the father, who is omnipotent/holds everything/ all-embracing [Leslau], I am Jesus Christ, the only begotten of the father. I am the son of the Virgin Mary, I am Jesus, king of the heavenly things and the earthly things, in all their ranks/kinds, I am the Lamb of God, who carries the sins of the world. From the time when you prepared your heart and stretched out your hand to help the poor, I was the one receiving from your hand and I have written them [i.e. your acts] for your sake in the book of life.” And having said this, he disappeared from his sight.</p>
<p>And this man, having heard this from the mouth of our Lord, rejoiced and was happy. He praised God, while saying, “You are righteous O lord God, all embracing, because you have remembered me, and you have exposed to me what my heart was thinking.”</p>
<p>And from this day forward, he did not cease to perform the feast while rejoicing and being glad all the days of his life.</p>
<p>When Patriarch Abba Yolyonas was in his residence after the [last prayer of the day] prayer of sleep/the dead, he heard a voice which said to him, “O archbishop, arise and wake up! So that you might see the joy and death/rest that will come to that blessed man you have forgiven many times. And look now, he is departing from his flesh, and I have raised up my eyes toward the east and I see three angels coming to receive his soul. [157v, col. 1, line 6; stopped translating, continued in the next session] And I, having observed, [trouble understand the verb; he understood/perceived me] I saw one of them sitting/dwelling around the [dead] man’s head and another by his feet, while comforting his soul until it departed from its flesh. And as for the third angel, I saw the angel stretching out the linen of light and he took the soul of that man and brought it heavenward with him. And I heard a voice saying, take this soul which has been performing mercy upon the needy and bring it into heaven so that the soul may rest [with] all the saints.” </p>
<p>Have you seen, my brothers, those who have placed their trust in God and upon his Virgin Mother and who have done mercy to the poor and needy on her feast? He will find great glory in this world and also the one to come. May her prayer and her blessing be with our King Yohannes and our queen Sabla Wengel. Forever and ever amen. </p>

1005,Däbrä Zämäddo miracles: Claiming the grotto at Däbrä Zämäddo for a church of the Blessed Virgin.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),"A miracle of Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God. May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved Son be with her servant Gäbrä Maryam forever and ever. Amen. In the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Listen to this, our fathers and brothers! Let us tell you the story of the miracle of Our Lady Mary which she worked at Däbrä Zämäddo in the rock grotto. A certain woman, whose husband was dead, had lived in it with her many possessions and many children. The name of the woman was Zämädä Maryam. But the courtyard she occupied belonged to Our Lady that her Son, Our Lord, had given her, saying, “Let it be your tithe”. When the time came for the owner of the house to move in to live (in it), she decided to evict the woman. (So) she stirred up a certain God-fearing monk from an island in the west called Mǝṣraḥa. The name of the monk was Bärtälomewos. He never had that place in mind. Rather, he set out (from Mǝṣraḥa) to go to Jerusalem. But our Lady turned him to the direction of her house and brought him, with the two exalted and honored angels, Michael and Gabriel, guiding him. They came to the woman and begged her, saying, “Vacate this place for us so that we may place (in it) the tabot of Our Lady”.  She replied to them, saying to them, “Where should I go? What shall become of me? I have no other house. And it is impossible for me to build a house. Furthermore, my children are young, and my household materials that God gave me are many”. She said this and refused their request. And the saints went back. For Our Lady’s custom is like that of a child who gives and begs whatever it is. Although she knew (the woman’s) thinking, nevertheless she sent messengers to teach us, the arrogant ones, the path of humility. In regards to the woman, she did not requite her with requital due to misers when she saw her stubborn mind. Rather, on that very night, she lifted her up with her children and all her possessions – without a shred of grass or a broken piece of glass falling – took her far away and placed her in a field called Märḥǝbä Si’ol because of the severity of the cold and frost that come down upon it. When she woke up from her sleep, she was shocked and trembled. But Our Lady did not cause her to be shocked nor to fear. She rather placed her well. At that time, the woman stood up and went to her former courtyard so that she could know what was going on. When she arrived, she found Abunä Bärtälomewos with the tabot of Our Lady Mary, having installed a wooden curtain. She admired this and was amazed; she had no word with which to react. In regards to our father, he lived happily, serving (Mary) with good service. And many doves, who were born from him and who took refuge with Our Lady Mary, filled it. Now let us go back to the subject which we had left. Please, do not agree, O man, when a critique criticizes, saying, “Why did she take away her courtyard without her consent?” Please, do not rush to judge, O man, against Our Lady before you know its mystery. For Our Lady does not abolish a law but makes laws; and she does not take forcibly others’ possessions. Let not your heart think that she took it from (the woman) forcibly. Rather, Our Lady was the first (to own) the courtyard, as she had received it from her Son. And you, the skeptic, will find (this fact) in another section, if you are not impatient. Abunä Bärtälomewos finished his time in toil and exhaustion, as the power of Our Lady helped him. May her prayer and blessing keep us and help us finish (our time) in good health and peace forever and ever. Amen. Getachew Haile, 1st ed., 2013.

1006,Däbrä Zämäddo miracles: Abbot Abunä Yoḥannǝs transported to Jerusalem.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),"After Abunä Bärtälomewos passed away, five shepherds were appointed to this mäkan. After that, Our Lady Mary sum-moned Abunä Yoḥannǝs, the pillar and foundation of the church, and drew him with the rope of her love from his country called Ǧan Amora, whose owner he was. For the sake of the love he had for Our Mary and for the sake of the love he had for her Son, he abandoned all the love of this world and its material and stood up quickly to go to where he had been called, to see the end and conclusion of the matter. When he left his country and was travelling on the road, he thought, and the thought which came to him was, “Go to Jerusalem”, came to him. As he was vacillating, he came to a certain village; he lodged there for the night and slept. At midnight, Our Lady came, picked him up and brought him to Jerusalem. She showed him all (the holy) places: (she took him) to the manger, where Our Lord was born; and to (the River) Jordan, where Our Lord was baptized – coming out (of the river, Our Lord) had sat on a rock which was at the bank of the river. She brought him to a place (called) Calvary, where Our Lord was crucified, and to his Golgotha Sepulcher. And she brought him up to Mount of Olive. She fulfilled for him (his wish) in a single night in a spiritual vision. The night was over as he woke up from his sleep and wondered. When morning broke, he resumed his journey. As he was on his journey, he met a certain poor woman. The woman said to him, “Listen to my words, O my brother!” And he said to her – for he was meek and a lover of the poor – “Go on, tell me your concern”. She told him many spiritual matters, and exhorted him. Having heard, he separated himself and resumed his journey. As he walked he met monks who were going to Abba Täṭämqä Mädḫǝn, the righteous and combatant (monk). He, too, went along with them. They arrived at the door of the monk. But Abunä Yoḥannǝs remained behind by the door to keep the support sticks and foot gears of the monks. Since he was meek and humble, he stayed behind alone to keep others’ possessions. They entered into the house and met with Abba Täṭämqä Mädḫǝn. When they met, Abunä Täṭämqä Mädḫǝn said to them, saying to them, “You have left outside at the door an exalted and honored person”. He said this and ordered them to call him in. They went out and searched. They returned to (Abba Täṭämqä Mädḫǝn) and said to him, “We did search, but we did not find one single person”. As for our father, they ignore him; they did not consider him someone like them because of his small body. He admonished them again, and said to them “Go and call in the righteous and honored one”. They said to him a third time, “There is nobody other than the child who keeps our support sticks”. He said to them, “Call this honored one in”. When Abunä Yoḥannǝs entered the house, Abunä Täṭämqä Mädḫǝn stood up from afar for the reception of Abunä Yoḥannǝs. He said to him, “Did you come back safely, O pilgrim of Jerusalem?” He said this and had (this) exhortation to follow: he said to him, “For now, lest you go to Jerusalem, Our Lady Mary has called you to keep the order of her house. And Abunä Bärtälomewos has prayed to God that you may keep his tomb. So, today you will not go. What you saw is enough for you. But later you will”. He also told him a secret; he said to him, “Regarding the woman who met you on the road, you should not think she was, or liken her to, one of the worldly poor. Rather, she was Our Lady Mary. Keep everything she told you. For the habit of Our Lady Mary is such when she visits the whole world.

1007,Däbrä Zämäddo miracles: The sainthood of young Abbot Abunä Yoḥannǝs revealed.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),"Listen! Let me tell you what Our Lady Mary did for Abunä Yoḥannǝs: When she summoned him from his country, she met him on the road looking like a poor woman. She also made him meet with Abunä Täṭämqä Mädḫǝn who interpreted for him everything. And then she appointed him shepherd of her sheep. Two years after he was appointed, and the time came about when she told him in the mouth of Täṭämqä Mädḫǝn, “Later you will go to Jerusalem”, grace stirred him and incited him. He sought someone who would ask God to straighten his journey for him, and Our Lady Mary that she may keep him from all evil. Since he was a humble person, he would not do what benefited himself. So he went to a certain woman who was God-fearing and a lover of Our Lady Mary, whose name was Sälome, who lived in the country of Qǝbtya, and said to her, “Pray for me to Our Lady Mary that she may guide me and make me come to Jerusalem and return me in good health and in peace”. She said to him, “Alright” and prayed to Our Lady Mary. When she prayed to her, Our Lady Mary came and said to her, “What are you requesting from me?” And she said to her, “It is about Yoḥannǝs, the abbot of Zämäddo; for he wants to go to Jerusalem”. Our Lady Mary heard and answered her about another matter. She showed her a shining city, decorated with flowers and fruits. She showed her what she had not asked her (to show her). The woman said to Our Lady Mary, “Whose is (this) city which is honored with this much honor?” Our Lady said to her, “It belongs to Bärtälomewos, the abbot of Zämäddo”. After she said this, (Our Lady Mary) followed with another matter. She started to tell her the glory of Däbrä Zämäddo. She said to her, “Zämäddo is my tithe which my Son gave me; it is a sister of Jerusalem”. Because it is the sister of Jerusalem, you, too, O man, know that Däbrä Zämäddo is more honored than the monasteries of Ethiopia which are called resting places of the righteous. For Jerusalem is honored more than the monasteries which are in the four corners of the world because it is the place of the incarnation of the Creator of the worlds. The end of his martyrdom, too, took place at it; his Sepulcher, too, is at it. And the memory of his Resurrection will be performed everywhere until the end of the world. And how would not Däbrä Zämäddo be more honored than all the monasteries (of Ethiopia), if Our Lady testified about it, saying, “But Zämäddo is my tithe and a sister of Jerusalem”? You, too, do know and comprehend that tithe is God’s property, and is honored more than all properties of the world. A sister is beloved to her sister. Therefore, we say, “Däbrä Zämäddo is (highly) honored, also because it is called a tithe of Our Lady Mary”. Furthermore, let us go back to the subject which we left before, about which you said to me “The house belonged to Zämädä Maryam”. You should not think that the house belonged to a worldly woman but that it is the house of the Lady of all of us. Regarding what I told you in the previous section, “You will find it later”, behold, I have told you (now) that it is the house of Our Lady Mary and her tithe which her Son has given her. And you, if you say to me, “Then why did the woman occupy the house of Our Lady Mary (in the first place)?” I will tell you, saying, “Because she was called by the name of Our Lady Mary”. But if you say to me, “Why did she evict her?” I, too, will say to you, “She has no guilt if she evicts her from her (own) house, and (Mary), the owner of the house, occupied (it)”. Furthermore, let me inform you, saying to you, “At at the be[ginning …” Behold,] we have told you our research on how the construction of Däbrä Zämäddo was started in the hands of Abunä Yoḥannǝs – its beginning and (later) its end. May the prayer and blessing of Our Lady Mary and the grace of Abunä Yoḥannǝs keep us from the host of the serpent, together with Abunä Gäbrä Maryam forever and ever. Amen.

1008,Däbrä Zämäddo miracles: Complaint of the icon for falling on the ground.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),"A miracle which Our Lady Mary worked for Abunä Yoḥannǝs and talked with him: After he completed the construction of her church, he placed her icon in it on a chair. One day (the icon) was dropped on the floor without the knowledge of the people of her household. The reason for its dropping was not known. But she went herself to Abunä Yoḥannǝs and said to him, “How are you sitting on your chair while I am dropped on the floor?” She said this and disappeared from him. When Abunä Yoḥannǝs heard the words of Our Lady Mary, he called one of the people of his household, and said to him, “Go quickly, pick up My Lady; for she is dropped on the floor”. The person whom he called replied to our father, saying, “She is not dropped, but is in a good position”. But our father said to him, “I say to you, go quickly and pick her up from the floor and place her on her chair”. Then (the messenger) went, and found her dropped on the flour, as our spiritual father had told him. He picked her up and placed her in a good position, as always, and returned to his father. The latter asked him, saying, “How did you find her?” The messenger replied to him, saying, “Yes, I found her dropped (on the floor) as you said”. Our father praised the messenger when he said, “Yes”. He said to him, “You did well that you told me the truth. If you had lied, in the manner in which you earlier said to me, ‘She is not dropped’, I, too, would have considered you a habitual liar. But you did well that you told me the truth. Behold, Our Lady Mary had come and told me, saying to me, ‘How are you sitting on your good chair while I am dropped on the floor?’ She said this and disappeared from me. For my part, I heard her words that she said to me, and obliged you to go and pick her up. And you, you did well that you said to me, ‘Yes’”. See, my brothers, how to lie is a serious offence. For our father had said to the messenger, “If you had belied my words, I, too, would have considered you a habitual liar”. This matter that he taught to the messenger concerns us as well, that we should keep saying “Yes”, and hate lies, in accordance with the words of Our Lord who said in the Gospel, “If people ask you something, say ‘Yes’, if it is true. But if it is not true, say ‘No/It is not.’” O my brother, regarding this “No/It is not”, you should not think that it is a lie, when you see (a mere) statement of “No/It is not”. Nor should you think, furthermore, that Our Lord had taught us (to lie) if you analyze (the statement of) “No/It is not”. “No/It is not” is truth, if said by itself. “No/It is not” is “Yes”, if it is said about what is not/it is not; it is not “No/It is not”. We, too, our brothers, must pursue the truth, and cast away the lie, so that Our Lady Mary may keep us as she kept Abunä Yoḥannǝs from many traps of Satan.

1009,Däbrä Zämäddo miracles: The detention by the people of the monastery’s cow for recompense.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),"A miracle which Our Lady Mary [worked] for Abunä Yoḥannǝs since  the past five (abbots), whom she had helped had passed, by showing her power and by revealing a miracle: (It happened) when the people of his country, who lived in the neighborhood of his abbey, quarreled with him and took his cow forcibly and in arrogance, by reason of the grass on which they said “(The cow) trespassed to graze”. They took it to their home, wanting to drink its milk for this reason. The herdsmen fled, fearing lest they beat them. All this happened, even though our father was their ruler and they were under his reign, because the enemy had instigated them and belittled the power of our father, making his power like nothing. The herdsmen who fled informed our father that the cow was taken booty. When Abunä Yoḥannǝs heard, he went to Our Lady Mary and informed her the news of his oppression – how they took his cow in arrogance – in order that she may show her power, not to requite them with requital due to the violence but only to reveal her miracle, that he was the administrator of her house and that she loved him very much, and also to reveal to them that he was not so weak, because they had said about him, “What can he bring upon us because the status of a monk in this world is like nothing”. Let us return to the former subject which we left. Those who took the cow milked (it) to drink (its milk). And Our Lady revealed her power: she changed the color of the milk as she changed formerly the color of the pair of scissors of Jacob the Short of Qälmon, the tailor of shirts. The pair of scissors was very nice and plated with gold. When an Arab saw the pair of scissors, he stole it from Jacob and took it to his country, knotting it with his garment. When Jacob could not find it, he was very sad. He told Our Lady Mary the sorrow in his heart. When the Arab came to his home country, he opened his garment to see the scissors. He found the pair becoming a serpent, because Our Lady Mary had changed it because of the prayer of Jacob. When the Arab saw it, he was shocked and frightened; he threw it on the ground. He thought of giving it (back) to Jacob. As he was thinking so, the serpent became scissors as before. When the Arab saw this, he returned the scissors to their former owner. Similarly, regarding the milk, although its nature is white, she changed its color and made it blood. When the people of the country saw, they were shocked and frightened. They went to Abunä Yoḥannǝs, having the cow before them. When they came to him, they fell at his feet, causing their tears to flow. They begged him to forgive their offense and to reconcile them with Our Lord Jesus Christ and Our Lady Mary. He, on his side, (had to) accept their repentance, as long as they repented. She changed the milk whose nature is white and made it blood when no offense was found either in the milk or in the cow, but the requital due to the people was revealed in the milk. If the people had not turned away from their crooked path, this change of the milk would have happened to them. Listen, my brothers! Repentance is good and the straight path. It brings people to the Mountain of God. And those people find forgiveness when they pray to Abunä Yoḥannǝs and Our Lady Mary. May the prayer and petition of Our Lady Mary dwell in her servant Gäbrä Maryam forever and ever. [Amen.]  Getachew Haile, 1st ed., 2013.

1010,Däbrä Zämäddo miracles: The revolt of the monks against Abbot Abunä Yoḥannǝs.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),"A miracle which Our Lady Mary worked for Abunä  Yoḥannǝs: When the people of the monastery became arrogant and despised his order, he was disturbed and was saddened in his heart very much. When he admonished them and gave them orders, following the rule whenever anything happened, they would violate his command. At that time he would be sad and depressed. A long time passed as they wrangled this way. And they lived a long time not observing what he told them. When the thickness of their hearts was too much, he started to tell his Lady of their violation and the oppression he suffered. The statement of his words ran like this: “If I am unable to keep them and if their hearts are not pleased with my words, you do what you want. You brought me here formerly and appointed me over them while my heart never thought of an appointment. However, at that time, they accepted me with pleasure; and they accepted me unanimously. But now they made their hearts evil. You judge me and them, because you are impartial, and you know the demeanor of all. What else shall I say?” And Our Lady, since she knew his oppression and the arrogance of the people of the monastery, sent pestilence to the people of the monastery. Forty monks died in one week. When Abba Bǝnyami saw, living in Gärägära, by the grace of God, that the pestilence was sent, he sent a message to Abunä Yoḥannǝs, saying, “Pray for them to God and to Our Lady Mary, lest your remaining children be finished, because Our Lady and Our Lord Jesus Christ are angry because of your oppression”. When Abunä Yoḥannǝs heard, he started rogation, carrying a big rock on his head and touring the shrine twelve times every day. Within twelve days, the wrath of God receded. The remainder of his children was saved by the prayer of Our Lady Mary. For whoever goes to her does not suffer; and whoever trusts in her will not be ashamed. Regarding this, Abunä Yoḥannǝs finished his time trusting in her, undefeated by his enemies. And on the day of his rest, she revealed to him words of prophecy. He reported (them) to his children, saying to them, “The Arämis will come and destroy all the Christians and lay all the churches waste. You will not oppose them; you will not be able to (even if you want) because they are authorized by God. Only flee peradventure you will be saved”. He said this and rested from the toil of this world by the prayer of Our Lady Mary. May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved Son be a buffer and shield for us on the day of trial and inquisition forever and ever. A(men). Getachew Haile, 1st ed., 2013.

1011,Däbrä Zämäddo miracles: The forces of iman Aḥmad Graññ at Däbrä Zämäddo are evaded,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),"Twenty-one years after Abunä Yoḥannǝs rested, his prophecy was at hand. The Arämi came and the Christian people fled. When the Arämi came to Däbrä Zämäddo and entered its fence, they saw the water that streams from the top of the cliff to the pavement of the church. The Arämi approached the water from below wanting to drink (it). The water fled in the direction of the betä lǝḥem through the middle of the cliff. They surpassed it to the betä lǝḥem, and the water returned back through the middle of the cliff and came to the top of the door of the hall. When the Arämi saw, they encircled the water, with some of them being by the betä lǝḥem and some of them at the top of the fence. It fled from their faces hither and thither. It was also suspended in the sky. The sound of the water was heard, but it did not come down. They did not get a single drop. All this happened so that Our Lady Mary may show her power. She made even the water flee hither and thither. Our Lady Mary did all this to show her power. And when the Arämi failed to get the water, they wanted to enter into the shrine. But Our Lady who made the water flee and made it so that they would not get it, sent insects that bite with their teeth and sting with their tails, lest they enter the shrine. She drove them away with such a miracle. After that they did not come back to this place. No one of the Arämi or Christians entered (it). It remained closed until the years of the Arämi had passed, (and) Śǝʿǝlä Adḫǝno returned from where the people who fled from fear of the Arämi had taken it, because they had taken it to another country. The work of Our Lady Mary is amazing. What would it look like if you analyzed it? It is amazing everywhere. She took Śǝʿǝlä Adḫǝno to another country and hid it there from all evil. As for the three tabots, she neither brought them down from their chairs nor brought them out from the shrine. The tabots of God stayed alone. The names of the three tabots are: two of the three are each a tabot of Our Lady Mary [and Jesus]; the small one is of Abunä Bärtälomewos; it is the first (to be here). But the two big ones were blessed here. The tabot of Our Lady Mary and the tabot of Jesus are of Abunä Yoḥannǝs. Ever since they entered into this church, they never left (it) for another country, be it for consecration or fleeing. But the wholly amazing Our Lady Mary, Bearer of God, keeps some where they are and saves some where they fled. Everything she does is amazing. The power of her salvation is admired very much. There is no other explanation. May her prayer and petition save us from the traps of our enemy forever and ever. [Amen.] Getachew Haile, 1st ed., 2013.

1012,Däbrä Zämäddo miracles: The icon Śǝʿǝlä Adḫǝno exiled to Ruḥa in Ethiopia,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),"When it was the time of the persecution, the people of the monastery left, carrying a few of (the monastery’s) books, as many as they were able to carry, and went to other countries; nothing is known about their status. But they left her icon in the city of Ruḥa, alone; no one stayed (with it) to keep it. As for the numerous and heavy books, they left them at the mouth of the cell, outside the shrine, which is on the left as one enters the shrine. Listen, my brothers, to the news the like of which has not been heard before this time! And see the power of the miracle of Our Lady Mary and her amazing deeds that have not been seen before, if you find the mind to know and evaluate her wisdom, to pursue her love manifested in the many kinds of salvation of Our Lady Mary! The cave, which we said they put the books in, is not dry but is a spring of water; also (water) comes down on it from above; and it drips from its side in all directions. The cave in which the books had been is not dry even during the season of Ḥagay, to say nothing of the season of Krämt. What does this thing look like – the presence of ink and parchment in the middle of water for about 50 years? Lest our minds doubt and we think the story looks like a lie, behold, here are the books called Sinodos, Qälemǝnṭos, Mäṣḥafä Bǝrhan, and Mäṣḥafä Mǝsṭir, whose brightness looks like the stars of the sky. There are also many others that were found with them. We also see the cave always dripping water like the sky during the season of Krämt. What do the story and deeds of this miracle look like? It has not been heard before – ink and parchment living in water, with the color of the parchment not spoilt or changed, and the letters not mixed with its pair! This miracle which Our Lady Mary worked at Däbrä Zämäddo is strange. If we hear the Holy Scriptures, (they tell us) that formerly Moses divided the Red Sea with his stick and put it asunder, (and the same) Scriptures tell us that the children of Israel passed on dry land. They do not tell us that they lived in the water. If it was God’s will, they would have lived in the water, but God forbid. God (wants) it to be known that he saves people in different ways. Therefore, he let them pass on dry land and brought them where they ought to settle, because their settlement was elsewhere. But the Red Sea he prepared and made the final settlement of the Egyptians. Let us come back to the case of the books about which we said were in the water, and leave the story of the Hebrews, for our interest is not in the Hebrews but in Our Lady Mary who worked this miracle for the sake of the salvation of man. (She will save) anyone, if his heart is firm in trust in her, saying, “She will save me, too, as she saved the property of her house from the destructive water”. If anyone says so and his heart is firm, Our Lady Mary, who does all this, has no interest other than in the salvation of man. (That is why) she made the water flee and made it run hither and thither. Furthermore, she made it not spoil her books until the time of tribulation was over, (which was) about 50 years. For God was angry with the Christians and (so) authorized the Arämi to occupy (Ethiopia). Furthermore, let us return to what Our Lady Mary did: Regarding the people who lived in (the monastery) but were not restricted by the rules of her (house), she scattered them to other countries. Had they been restricted by her rules, she would have preserved them together with her books, as God had preserved Baruch and Abimelech who lived observing his law when the Children of Israel, who committed too much lawlessness, were taken into captivity. In regards to the people of Our Lady Mary’s household, too, she did not let them remain in her house before, but expelled them and dismissed them to wherever they wanted. We do not know their end either. But us, O our brothers, let us pray to Our Lady Mary, Bearer of God, lest she make us like them. May her prayer and blessing be with her servant Gäbrä Maryam forever.

1013,Däbrä Zämäddo miracles: The icon Śǝʿǝlä Adḫǝno recovered.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),"Listen! Let us tell you a miracle which Our Lady Mary worked when she willed the return of her icon to Däbrä Zämäddo, for they had left it in the city of Ruḥa: She talked to a certain monk, who was a God-lover and her lover. He was living in Däbrä Azäzo, coming from Däbrä Libanos. The name of the monk was Habtä Śǝllase. She said to him, “Take me home. For I have been in Däbrä Lalibäla since I left my country”. When the monk heard the words of Our Lady Mary, he rose up quickly and went in haste to where she directed him. He arrived at the church  of  Mary, called  ʿAmdä  Bǝrhan, and inquired about and searched for the news of the icon, of its coming formerly and its presence there. He inquired with the noblemen who had survived there. They replied to him, saying, “We were not here before because we are strangers. We have not heard any news that it came from elsewhere, nor   do we know of its presence here”. (The monk) was shocked and was saddened very much. He was depressed for his coming from far. He said, “My toil was in vain. This must be the work of my enemy. No one else would do this”. He said this and cried bitterly. He fell on the ground and rolled himself, saying, “How would the enemy appear in the likeness of My Lady?” Saying so, he cried and lamented. Because of his excessive sorrow and his crying, he was exhausted. He leaned against a wall and had a short sleep. At that moment, Our Lady Mary came to him and said to him, “Do not be sad. For your coming was not of Satan, but of the good will of God (which) brought you and made you reach here. I am, indeed, here”. She said this and directed him to the place where she was. She said to him, “Open that window, because I am in it”. When he heard the words of Our Lady Mary, he rose up from his sleep and went to the window and opened it quickly. He found (the icon) Śǝʿǝlä Adḫǝno in it. He rejoiced very much when he found it, because what Our Lady told him was the truth, not a lie (from Satan). He took it out of the window, carried it and took it to its country. As he traveled, he came to the top of Ǝnǧafat at the juncture of two roads, one that went toward Ǝnǧafat and the other that went toward Yägär Laʾlay. When he came to the juncture of the two roads, he rested a while. At that moment, Our Lady Mary said to him, “Rise up quickly and take the road on the right that goes toward the monastery. Do not tarry here because a black dog is coming by the road on the left. Pick me up quickly lest it pollute me by touching (me)”. He heard and took the road she directed him to take. After he walked (a distance of) three miles, one of his servants said to him, “Let me go back to where we had rested, because I forgot something (there). I will go and bring it”. (His master) said to him, “Behold, do not go (back); let it be left. Behold, (Our Lady) had told me, saying, ‘Rise up  quickly. A dog is coming; let it not pollute me by touching (me).’” Although his master told him this, he refused (to listen) and went back to where he had left his thing because the man was originally a violator of orders. He did not listen to the words of others. He did not do but what his mind thought, because his look was black. The house of his origin was from the race of Ham. When he came to where he had left his thing, as he picked it up, the Arämi, which Our Lady Mary called a dog, and (because of which) told (the monk), “Pick me up quickly lest it pollute me by touching (me)”, found him. The Arämi killed the servant on the spot. Listen, our brothers! If a habit – however it happened – is established, and people say, “The behavior of so and so is such”, it never separates from him even for a day, but brings him to such a destiny. And his end is the Hell of fire. Let us go back to the story of the icon: (The monk) brought her to her home with much search, herself guiding him and keeping herself. May her prayer and petition and the mercy of her beloved Son be with her servant Gäbrä Maryam forever and ever. Amen. Getachew Haile, 1st ed., 2013.

1014,Däbrä Zämäddo miracles: The icon Śǝʿǝlä Adḫǝno stolen and returned,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),"A miracle which Our Lady Mary worked at Däbrä Zämäddo after Śǝʿǝlä Adḫǝno was returned from where she was exiled: The people of the (royal) camp and the people of the palace heard the news that Śǝʿǝlä Adḫǝno was present at Däbrä Zämäddo, working wonders and doing astonishing things to hear, and that the art of its beauty was startling and fearful to see. It is not right to compare it with any icons made by the hand of a human being. I am not sure it was made by the hand of a human being. I think it was rather made by the hand of God. For it is not impossible for God to do this, because he is the bringer of the worlds and the creator of angels (out of nothing). It would not be impossible for God himself to create it, rather than authorize a human being (to paint it). When the people of the (royal) camp heard about this power she worked and how the art of her image was stunning, they sent a thief to steal the miracle- and wonder-working icon of Our Lady Mary, Bearer of God, and take it to the camp. The thief came to Däbrä Zämäddo and entered the shrine by night. He found Śǝʿǝlä Adḫǝno; he picked it up, carried it, took it out of the shrine and set out through the road he thought was the road that would bring him to the camp. But Our Lady Mary guided him to where she wanted, and brought him to the field where the worldly people assemble on her feast day to watch her icon. People had formed a huge crowd, and (the clergy) entered the church to pray and lift incense, and at that moment, (they noticed that the icon) was missing from its chair. The clergy shouted immediately, and the people of the monastery assembled. They roared and blew the horn. The people of the country heard and all came out and were dispersed to the four corners of the earth, on horses and on foot, wanting to search for it and restore it. At midday, someone went to the field to search for his own concern, not to search for (the icon), but for his own concern. He went to the field which we mentioned earlier, saying, “The worldly people assemble in it on the feast day of Our Lady Mary to watch her icon”. When the man got there, he suddenly (and) unexpectedly found the thief standing and his legs tied with a rope of miracle – which is stronger than iron fetters, although it is not visible to the eye – and carrying the Lady of us all. The man who found the thief shouted. The people of the monastery heard and assembled by him, where the Lady of us all was found. The horn was blown, and there was much jubilation. Mourning was removed and the clergy danced and sang, thanking God and praising the Lady of us all. At that moment, the people of the monastery and the people of the country held counsel to execute (the thief). Some said, “Let us not execute him, but amputate his hands and legs”. And some of them said, “Let us execute him”. But the tender-hearted Our Lady Mary, Bearer of God, revealed the judgment to the abbot. The abbot said, “As for us, let us let him go. We did not find him by our search or wisdom. Our Lady Mary, Bearer of God, delivered him into our hands, binding (him) with the rope of miracle. If she wants his execution, executing him is not impossible for her. And if she wants to let him go, she knows (what to do). But on our part, let us let him go wherever he wants”. They decided on this and released him. He went wherever he wanted. Listen, my fathers and brothers! This miracle which the icon of Our Lady showed and the judgment she passed on the thief was not a judgement thieves deserve, but a judgment of peace makers, as the search (for the icon) and theft had happened because of strength of love for her. If we compare this incident, it is similar to what she did at Ṣaydnāyā and the judgment she passed in favor of the Afrǝngawi. When this Afrǝngawi was in his country and when he travelled for his business, he heard the news about the icon of Our Lady Mary, that it was in Ṣaydnāyā in the house of Märina (an icon) which works wonders and sheds sweat until it drips on the ground, and with the sweat it heals the entire world. And the art of her appearance was amazing to describe. When (the Afrǝngawi) heard all this news of the icon, he abandoned all the worldly desire in his heart and went quickly to it because his mind had been burnt by her love. He planned to enter their (community) looking like a pilgrim and a way- farer and as if he would live there until the day of his death. He planned this, not to live there but for a cover until he would find a way to steal it and take it to his country. And the people of Martha received him in innocence as it is meet for brothers to receive strangers quickly. They let him live with them in peace. They did not know the guile in his heart – that he came to steal. And the Afrǝngawi did not know that theft was an offence. Rather, he only looked for a way to find (the icon). When he was unable to get it, after he lived there many days, the enemy made him think of another ruse to steal half of its body. He let his hand into an opening of the hedge and cut off with a knife half of its body. At that time, much blood was shed. His hands and clothes were smeared with blood. At that time, when he saw this miracle, he was frightened and shocked. He fled, lest they kill him. As he was fleeing, a man met him and saw that his clothes were smeared with blood. He said to him, “Whom did you kill, was it a righteous man?” The Afrǝngawi said to him, “I did not kill any one, neither righteous nor sinner, but I cut off the icon of our Lady Mary”. The man heard and took him to others. The whole world assembled and counseled to execute him. Our Lady Mary said, “Do not execute him. For what he has done was not with violence and malice. He rather did this because of his much love for me”. Saying so, she let him be left so that they may not execute him. As for the cut off part of her body, she ordered them to join it to where it was cut off. When they joined it to where it was cut off, the piece of the body was glued quickly. The trace of the knife could not be found. But the blood did not fade. It is there, smeared for a sign of where it once was, close to the picture of Our Lady Mary. That which is seen like blood (on the panel), where the picture is, is not paint but blood about which we had heard before. The icon which was in the house of Martha is this same one which is in Däbrä Zämäddo. The one that the Afrǝngawi cut off is this icon of Our Lady Mary which is in Däbrä Zämäddo. The one that saved the Afrǝngawi, lest they execute him is this same icon of Our Lady Mary which is in Däbrä Zämäddo. As we heard before how, in Ṣaydnāyā, she saved the Afrǝngawi from death, similarly, we saw in Däbrä Zämäddo, how she saved the thief. The one in Däbrä Zämäddo is that of Ṣaydnāyā. The one of that time is the same one which is there today, and the one which was cut off is (also) the same one. The piece of body that was glued when they joined it is the same one near the picture of Our Lady Mary. The one that was cut off is the same, and the one that was glued is the same. Look how its body parts are smeared with blood. We brought you this news. Accept it with your ears and put it in your heart. If you believe in Our Lady Mary, that it is possible for her to do all this and you take refuge with her help, you will be saved from all destruction, O worldly man. When Our Lady Mary shows all these miracles, she has no desire that benefits her, but only trust that her power is to save people. May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved Son be with her servant Gäbrä Maryam forever and ever. Amen. Getachew Haile, 1st ed., 2013.

1015,Däbrä Zämäddo miracles: Fountain of honey milk sprang up under the feet of Abunä Bärtälomewos.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),"A miracle which Our Lady Mary worked for Abunä Bärtälomewos: After he brought the tabot inside the grotto, he made his standing place outside the grotto on the top of the rock which is very dry. One day, as he was standing, she caused white water to spring from under his feet. Its taste was like milk. Listen, my brothers! Everything Our Lady Mary does to her beloved ones is wonderful and amazing. This miracle deserves admiration and praise. When Abunä Bärtälomewos saw this miracle – the water turning white – and drank from it, its taste was like milk. When Abunä Bärtälomewos saw this, he said to his Lady, “If you have done for me what has not been done before for other saints, I beg you – say, yes to me – to change the appearance of this that you caused to spring from under my feet, into water, and its taste to be in accordance with its nature. This that happened today, if its appearance and taste become normal, will not benefit my children. Let (the water’s) taste be natural, so that the people of the country may not have it robbed from them and the rulers keep it for their own need. However, let not your help be ever removed, so that it may be a hope to my children”. And Our Lady Mary, Bearer of God, accepter of the petition of all, did for him (what he asked): she made the milk water. May the prayer and blessing of Our Lady Mary, Bearer of God, and the power of the covenant (given) to Abunä Bärtälomewos keep Gäbrä Maryam forever and ever. Amen. Getachew Haile, 1st ed., 2013.

1016,Däbrä Zämäddo miracles: The oppressive ruler of Dänägäz whom Abbot Abunä Yoḥannǝs opposed,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),"A miracle which Our Lady Mary worked during the time of Abunä Yoḥannǝs on the feast day of Abunä Bärtälomewos, (the first) abbot of Däbrä Zämäddo: People gather together on his memorial day to perform the feast because it was ordered formerly that people who are under the dominion of Abunä Bärtälomewos gather together to perform a feast. Those who were appointed under his office and people from the four corners of the land are gathered together to share the blessing of Our Lady Mary, Bearer of God, because they watch her icon on the day of rest of Abunä Bärtälomewos. For people who are gathered together (for the occasion) find two benefits: one comes from taking refuge with the saints, and the other is they report to the officer the news of their condition, whether or not the ruler rules them with hardship and oppresses them. They would tell him the misfortune inflicted on them. And (the abbot) on his part would pray to Our Lady Mary (on their behalf); and Our Lady would hear him immediately and remove for them their sorrow. Accordingly, the people of Dänägäz, who were among the people who gathered together on this feast at the time of Abunä Yoḥannǝs, reported to the latter the news of their oppression, because the ruler had tormented them very much. When Abunä Yoḥannǝs heard, he summoned the ruler and asked him to lighten the yoke of the poor. The ruler heard and said to him, “Alright, I will do what you told me. And you will reconcile me with them tomorrow, but today it is already evening; release me to go to my lodging”. When he released him, with this excuse, he left quickly the same night, and arrived at his country in the morning. For he was angry with Abunä Yoḥannǝs and the poor, saying, “Who of these poor will ever dare to come to my country? For they have accused me (of oppressing them) at the abbot. And which abbot can order me? I will not allow myself to be ruled by the abbots any more. And my feet will not come to this monastery (any more), nor will my eyes see it”. He arrived at his country as he murmured these words and announced (his decision) to the whole country. Those poor people told Abunä Yoḥannǝs that (the ruler) had left during the night. He said to them, “You, too, go (home)”. They said to him, “Our mind would not even think of it, not to speak of doing to it, (because we know) how the ruler would treat us”. When Abunä Yoḥannǝs heard, he went to Our Lady and told her the mockery of the ruler, and as the Scripture says, “The prayer of the righteous is capable and empowers”. And Our Lady Mary heard his words immediately. She said to him, “Tell them, ‘Go immediately; do not tarry so that you may see the power of my Son and the power of my miracles given to me.’ For the prophecy of this arrogant ruler has arrived. He has said, ‘I will not come to Däbrä Zämäddo anymore.’ For this prophecy of his has been fulfilled for him”. When they heard (this) from Abunä Yoḥannǝs, they left and arrived at their country in the evening of the same day. They found the people of the country coming together (and) burying him. They arrived and inquired about what happened to him. The people said to them, “He came slandering Abunä Yoḥannǝs, and, regarding you, counseling with his angel of counsel, the Satan, the father of lies, saying, ‘I shall not let those who accused me at the abbot in my country. Let me see, if the abbot can save them from my servitude.’ He also said, ‘I will not let myself be ruled by an abbot any more. And I will rule people with hardship, if I want. I will make them like the kwahat of the gate of the city. And if I want, I will scatter them, so that they wander in another country. And in regard to Däbrä Zämäddo, my eyes shall not see it anymore.’” He arrived as he murmured these words. But before the words of his mouth – false accusation and slander – were finished, sudden death came upon him, because Abunä Yoḥannǝs had complained to Our Lady Mary against him. And Our Lady Mary, because she knew his demeanor, sent upon him the cup of death to fulfill the words of his prophecy, because he had said with his own mouth, “I shall not see Däbrä Zämäddo, and I will not let myself to be ruled by its abbot”. She fulfilled for him what he wished. For there is no servitude for man in flesh after death. He mindlessly prophesized his passing away because he had said, “I shall not see Däbrä Zämäddo”. Listen, my brothers! And understand this incident, lest words of arrogance, false accusation and slander come out of your mouth, so what found this violent man will not find you. Gǝlyanos, too, when he showed arrogance toward Basil and Gregory, when he slandered them and appointed for them a day for (their) torture, she sent Mercurius, the martyr of the Son, to requite (Gǝlyanos) with the requital due to his violence and the requital of his arrogance. The same happened against this violent man, too. Because he had been arrogant toward Abunä Yoḥannǝs and the poor people of his country, she sent on him a sudden death. May her prayer and blessing be with her servant Gäbrä Maryam forever and ever. Amen.  Getachew Haile, 1st ed., 2013.

1017,Däbrä Zämäddo miracles: The three monks who thought of leaving Däbrä Zämäddo survive for months on the spring of honey milk,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),"A miracle which Our Lady Mary showed on the water she caused to spring up from under the feet of Abunä Bärtälomewos: When she first caused it to spring up, its color was white, and its taste was like milk. When Abunä Bärtälomewos prayed to her, she changed its appearance and made it like water. After Abunä Bärtälomewos had rested, there were – among the people who came together for silence, who depended on Our Lady Mary, Bearer of God, and who were born of Abunä Bärtälomewos in cap – three men, monks, who lived in brotherhood and (were bound together) with the rope of love. They did not want the toil of others, but fed on their owen manual work. Their manual work was working the farm field. With this, they were devoted to prayer. And in church, too, they served day and night. Whatever happened, they were never late in lifting incense and the Communion. They were assiduous for Godly work and strangers to vain matters. People never accused them of any evil thing. To the contrary, they praised them with good praise. After they lived in this order for many years, one year, their supply became short. They sowed their farm fields, fighting so many difficulties. When the month of Säne came and their grain was finished, the brothers counseled to go to another country – where there is (good) harvest – and spend the rainy season there. As they set out to go, Our Lady Mary distracted them with an idea, lest they leave on that day, because she did not want their departure because they were her beloved ones and attendants of her house. She brought them an idea and they discussed (it) among themselves. They said, “Let us not go today, because we have eaten yesterday. What would we reply to Our Lord, if we did not spend a night fasting. Today there is, indeed, not a single seed in our abode. So we will spend the night fasting, and tomorrow we shall go where we intended to. It will be proof for us if Our Lord asks us in the mouth of any person, saying, ‘Why did you leave your cell before you spent a night fasting?’ It will be right for us for answering. Let us spend the night fasting. We can go tomorrow”. They spent the day in accordance with this counsel. In the evening, she made them think to fetch water from where she caused it to spring up from under the feet of Abunä Bärtälomewos, in order to do her good deed by reason of the water, because Our Lady Mary, Bearer of God, thinks of different ideas to save people using many of them. The brothers fetched water from where we mentioned before. She also made them have a thought: they said, “Let us not drink before we measure (it) because it is the property of God”. They said this and poured it in a big gourd, one cup of which would fill a person. When one (of them) tasted it, it was wonderful in his mouth, because Our Lady Mary had made it honeycomb. He finished it with difficulty. For the other two, too, it happened like it did for the first one. When they saw this, they said, “But today we have found dinner that is greater than our normal meal”. On each next day, too, it became similarly honey until the three months (of Krämt) were over, and as the monks said, “We will go tomorrow if we spend this night fasting. But today, we have found dinner that is greater than usual. How can we leave Our Lady when she has not left us? How can we leave her while she feeds us what is better than food? When Our Lady Mary, Bearer of God, herself leaves us, when this honey becomes water, at that time we will leave”. As they said, “We will go (the day after) tomorrow rather than tomorrow”, starting with Säne, they came to Mäskäräm. And their farm field which was sowed was ready (to supply food). It produced perfect ear corn. They cut from the ear corn and brought some home. They roasted it with fire, and ate until they had enough, saying in their heart, “We will drink our honey later”. (But) when they tasted the honey after they had eaten enough from the ear corn, the water returned to its former nature and became (real) water. Look at this miracle which the perfectly admirable Our Lady Mary, Bearer of God, had worked! May her prayer and blessing be for us a buffer and shield against this (turbulent) time. And may they save us from the search before her Son, Us, her male and maiden servants, Forever and ever. Amen. Getachew Haile, 1st ed., 2013.

1018,Däbrä Zämäddo miracles: The three big boulders that ripped off from the cliff and destroyed the roof and walls of the church kitchen,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),"A miracle which Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, worked at Däbrä Zämäddo: There is a mountain above the church of Our Lady Mary. Three big boulders broke and ripped off and came down in the direction of her church, following each other. The first came down by the left of the betä lǝḥem, damaging nothing. But the second hit the betä lǝḥem, as the properties of our Lady Mary with which the clergy worked in the betä lǝḥem, were in it. When the wall of the betä lǝḥem was hit, its side was shattered, with only some of it remaining. Its roof as well as the majority of its wall went way down. The wall was scattered way down. The roof of the house, too, was scattered and crushed. The boulder is the one that is (now) at the gate of the church. O my brothers, see and listen to this miracle which Our Lady Mary works! When the wall of the house was shattered, and when its roof was scattered, not one of the properties of Our Lady Mary in it, with which the clergy worked, was damaged by the strike of the boulder. See this miracle! Are not a wall of a house, built with many stones and much mud, and a roof of a house, of much workmanship, stronger than a (clay) griddle and (clay) jar and all that were made like them? Everything would have perished, if they had not been saved by the power of God. The mighty is not saved by his/its might; and the weak is not destroyed because of his/its weakness, because God keeps him/it with his Bearer, Mary, the redeemer of the world. Compare this matter which Our Lady Mary worked. Although all are her properties, she destroyed the mighty and saved the weak, lest we say, “The mighty is saved by his great might”. And the weak is not destroyed because of his weakness, if he puts his trust in God and in Our Lady Mary, his Bearer. Regarding the third boulder, it followed the (other) two. When its coming was in the direction of the shrine and when Abba Bäʾaminä Ǝgziʾabḥer came out of the shrine and saw it bouncing, comeing down, he excommunicated it before it landed and adjured it saying, “By the prayer of Abunä Bärtälomewos and by the power of the help of Our Lady Mary, and by the mercy of Our Lord Jesus Christ”, he said to it, “Stop where you are, and do not land”. When the boulder heard the name of its Creator and the name of Our Lady, Bearer of God, before it landed, it stopped (suspended) where it was, not to speak of coming down. Listen, my brothers, how all creatures but humans are servile to their creator! If man were like this boulder, he would have not given up without doing what he thinks. May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved Son, that stopped the boulder, lest it come down, stop for us the punishment of God, lest it come upon us forever and ever. Amen.

1019,Däbrä Zämäddo miracles: The dangerous cliff side entrance to the church is improved by the abbot and Mary,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),"Listen, our brothers! Let us tell you the miracle that Our Lady Mary worked for Abunä Ṣama Iyyäsus, abbot of Däbrä Zämäddo, because of his sainthood, his love to her, and because of his service to God, in fasting, prayer, repeated prostration to the ground and in sweat, and for being a lover of people, because he was humble. Therefore, she worked a miracle for him. The entrance of the church was by a (dangerous) cliff. People entered the church with much difficulty and hardship. They entered and exited falling and rising up. Some entered by the chapel of Täklä Haymanot. And some entered by the rump of the cliff where water dripped. The middle (area), which is (now) a field and running place (even) for the lame and the blind when they entered and exited the shrine, was a big cliff. If someone fell, he would not stand up in good health, but would be bruised and crushed. Some died. Whenever Abunä Ṣama Iyyäsus saw this, he was saddened. (As) he was thinking of what he should do, a big tree which was inside the gate of the fence, on the right side of the water of life, fell down. At that time, a thought came to him: he gave an order that people cut it into pieces; and they did. Then they gathered the pieces of wood into the ditch. And he added (more) stones and logs up to the big rock below. To his dismay, while he intended to improve, (the entrance), this, the wood and stone that he piled, made it worse. What he thought would improve (it, instead) prevented entrance because it was not leveled. The people of the country, too, everywhere, said to him, “Thinking you would improve it, you did for us what is worse”. On his part, when he heard (people’s complaints), he asked Our Lady Mary, saying to her, “Many righteous people who took refuge with you have made pavements on water and built a shrines on them. If you received their petition with your Son, and remembered their labor, for me, too, do now81 what I ask you, and level this crooked (path)”. When he asked her to fulfill (his wish), she heard his words and brought much rain in the dry season, when the heat was as in the time of Elijah. She poured the rain on the mountain. The rain was capable of moving the earth. She caused the earth to come down in one direction like a spring of water that runs in one direction. She made it not come down into the cliff but land on the pieces of the wood and the stones, and sand filled (it). And so, the crooked part was no longer (crooked). What people left crooked (the previous) evening they found leveled in the morning and being a running place for the blind and the lame. May the prayer and blessing of Our Lady Mary save us, too, from the blaspheming Satan, as they filled the cliff with sand and made it a passable field forever and ever. Amen.

1020,Däbrä Zämäddo miracles: Abunä Ṣama Iyyäsus averts a raid by the Oromo people with prayers to Mary,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),"Another miracle that Our Lady Mary, who is Maryam in Hebrew, worked for Abunä Ṣama Iyyäsus when the Arämi counseled and gathered from many regions and camped at the land of Waǧa to lay waste the Christian regions of Wakat, Ṭäṭära, the low land, and Mäqdäla. They counseled against these regions and made a (military) camp because the Arämi have the tradition of laying regions waste whenever they change reign. This time, too, (they camped) because the one they called Dayyu Daba was appointed. The time for their tradition of devastation and attack is the month of Ḫǝdar, on the feast day of Saint Michael, the Archangel. They lay (regions) waste at that time. When Abunä Ṣama Iyyäsus heard that they had come together for this purpose, he rose up to fight (them), making the (prayer) Our Father his sword, with fruits of the olive tree, and making the Prayer of Our Lady Mary his spear. And he made the Covenant of Our Lady Mary his shield. Long before the Arämi arrived to fight, he would fight (them) standing before the tabot of Our Lady Mary and Our Lord Jesus Christ day and night. As the Arämi would set out to come to the direction of his country, he would hear and report to Our Lady Mary, saying to her, “How could you neglect your country, and deliver the sons of your household to the Arämi?” At that time she would send the Arämi back and disperse them, after they had set out to fight. They would go on doing so, with their heart never abandoning the fight, and (the people of the monastery) never resting (from watching). Whenever (Abunä Ṣama Iyyäsus) would hear the news of the coming of the Arämi, he would report to Our Lady Mary and she would return them and disperse them after they set out to fight. They went on so, starting in the month of Ḫǝdar, until the month of Mäggabit, with the Arämi not resting nor giving respite to our father. When Our Lady Mary saw the determination of the Arämi and their counsel to destroy her country, she drove them to the land of Adäl when they did not suspect it. And there, she requited them the requital due to the evil. She let them fall in the hands of their enemy. None but one of their twelve chiefs came back. We do not know if, of their armies, one from each country had ever survived (to bring) the news. What is known is that they were wiped out. (This) was heard by everybody. See what Our Lady Mary works for her beloved ones! If there is one who puts his trust in her, she will work for him, too. To us, too, (she will do) likewise, if we put our trust in her. For she is not biased against anyone among those who put their trust in her. She would not say about one, “I love him”, and about the other, “I hate him”. And regarding Abunä Ṣama Iyyäsus, the prayer he did, ten hundred Our Father, he had been doing (it) every day in the days of his sorrow. He defeated his enemies with this his prayer and his trust in Our Lady Mary. May the prayer and blessing of Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, keep the wretched and weak Gäbrä Maryam forever and ever. Amen. Getachew Haile, 1st ed., 2013.

1021,Däbrä Zämäddo miracles: Abbot Abunä Yoḥannǝs persuades a husband to give up his second wife and be reconciled to his first,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),"Listen, our brothers! Let us tell you a miracle which Our Lady Mary, Bearer of God, worked for Abunä Yoḥannǝs: There was, during the time of Abunä Yoḥannǝs, a certain man in the land of Mälko Amba. When he quarreled with his wife, his wife sent a missive to Abunä Yoḥannǝs, the abbot of Däbrä Zämäddo. She sent, saying, “What shall I do with this husband of mine because he saddened me too much and depressed me exceedingly? Should I come to you, and leave him behind? For he married (another) woman besides  me”. When Abunä Yoḥannǝs heard, he went to them. He arrived and preached to them and made them understand many spiritual matters. He reminded them of the death of the body, the death of the soul, going down into the grave and standing before the Creator. Then he made peace between them. (The husband) expelled his concubine from his house and sent her away. (The father) did this and left for his country. Five months later, when it was the season of Krämt, and the water of (the River) Ṣǝllare rose high, knowing that people cannot cross and pass over (the river) during the season of Krämt, (the man) brought back his concubine and let her settle in his house, rebuking his wife, saying to her, “Now, let this father of yours, about whom you always boast, help you”. She kept quiet, knowing that the water would not let people pass. And her husband addressed her with many abusive words, saying, “Why does not this father and teacher of yours, about whom you always boast, help you today?” Saying so, he addressed her with many abusive words. But she did not reply a word, but only poured her tears like a spring of water. And her eyes poured (tears) like the rain of Krämt. Abunä Yoḥannǝs knew this her tribulation as God had revealed it to him. “Her father” rose up immediately and entered the shrine. He prayed to, and begged, Our Lady Mary, Bearer of God, saying to her, “What should I do? This case is anguishing me. I cannot go because the season is Krämt, and the water is dreadful; it is impossible to cross (the river). Nor can I remain because the oppression of the woman saddens me. And the abuse of the man burns my heart. Does not the Scripture say, ‘The word of mockery destroys the soul like wax before the face of fire.’” When he told the case to Our Lady Mary, Bearer of God, Our Lady Mary, having heard this, allowed him to go and divide the water with his cross, and put the arrogant man to shame by his going, because he would be shocked very much when he comes to him, (and) when he sees his face. When Abunä Yoḥannǝs heard the words of Our Lady Mary, Bearer of God, he went immediately. When he came to (the River) Ṣǝllare, he blessed the water with his cross, as she instructed him. The water was divided and stood on the right and on the left. The middle became dry land. Abunä Yoḥannǝs passed through the dry land, like Joshua, the prince of Israel. Abunä Yoḥannǝs crossed (the river) and came to that violator of the law. When he saw the face of Abunä Yoḥannǝs, he became like a dead man due to being startled. And our father arrested him and bound his hands and legs. The man wailed and brought interceders. The whole country begged (our father) to release him, to forgive him totally. They adjured him in (the name of) Our Lady Mary and in the name of Our Lord Jesus Christ to release him. That was difficult for our father. They adjured him in the name of his Creator and in the name of Our Lady Mary, lest he refuse them, because Our Lady Mary’s habit is generosity and Our Lord Jesus’ habit is forgiveness. Furthermore, Our Lady Mary had shown her power to the violator of the law by his coming to him in the season of Krämt. (Therefore) he accepted their petition and forgave the oppressor for the sake of all things that Our Lady Mary had done for him, and having noticed (it). He released him of his bond when they adjured him in the name of Our Lady Mary because our father was reasonable. Because she had first received his prayer and brought him to the violator of the law in the season of Krämt, he, too, forgave him for the sake of the name of Our Lady Mary and reconciled him with his wife. See, my brothers, the much generosity of Our Lady Mary! When Abunä Yoḥannǝs prayed to her, although the water of (the River) Ṣǝllare was full, she made dry land in its middle, specifically for him, and he passed over on dry land. He came to where he intended to and fulfilled his desire. And the violator of the law was released from the iron bond in his body and soul, when people adjured in her name. May the prayer of Our Lady be a buffer and shield forever and ever. Amen. Getachew Haile, 1st ed., 2013.

There was a church (in Mägdälo) built in the name of Our Lady Mary. Near the church, there lived a woman whose name was Maḫdärä Maryam. The woman was a chosen and honored one in good deeds. She was truly a maḫdärä Maryam, because she loved (Mary) exceedingly and served her in everything she could. She did not interrupt going to church day or night to pray to Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, for the salvation of her soul. She lived many years serving in church. After she lived many years near the church, her husband took her and moved her to another country far from the church whose distance was about 60 miles and placed her in a nice compound, because he was a ruler of the country (and could) do whatever he wanted. And his wife was a daughter of the nobility. So he placed her in a compound of his choice. After he settled her, he took a military expedition and tarried where he went. She built a tall and wide house of twin pinnacles. It was very nice; it was beautiful in its construction and foundation. Whoever saw it likened it to a church. When its construction and its fence were completed, the woman then moved in to live (in it). But her husband did not come back from where he went. He was very happy there because he had destroyed the Pagans and inherited their land. Therefore, he was very happy. Nevertheless, he was sad because it had been a while, more than ten years, since he had been separated from his wife. When his delay was too long, he slipped one day in the act of adultery. And the adulterous woman, who caused the man to fall, conceived. He had lived in abstention and no words of calumny had been heard about him before a day failed him. At that time, his wife heard that he had stumbled by a block of adultery. She sent him a missive, saying, “Do not show me your face after this, not to speak of us meeting in a way that a man and a woman do by being one body”. When he saw that the letter came from his wife, his heart burnt with the fire of sorrow, because he knew her mind, that she would not take back her word once it came out of her tongue. Therefore, his heart burnt with sorrow. He remained where he went, leaving all his children and his property because he knew her mind and that her dependence was on Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God. As this chosen one was living in her house, Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, sent her a missive, saying, “Give me your house that I may move in and live in it”. She sent many intercessors. But (the woman) refused, saying, “Where would I go?” She went on many years on this stand, and Our Lady Mary not giving up the (request) saying, “Give me your house”. The woman did not accept the words of the message. Finally, herself, Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, went (to the lady) at noon and found her at the threshold of her house. Our Lady Mary spoke to her with words of greetings. She was not wrathful because she was her beloved one. She knew her mind, that she was not a lover of money. She did not refuse any one of what one wanted, not to speak (of the request) of her Lady. She did not think about money, saying, “Let it be for me”. Rather, she gave it to anyone who was in need. If you ask me, “Then why did she refuse first when Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, sent a missive?” I, too, inform you, saying, “It was not to refuse (it) but to show the strength of her love to Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, when she went to her, and for this miracle to be revealed and every creature to hear it and admire, when they see the humility of Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God”. She begged her her house, making her the mistress although she was her maidservant. See the humility of Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God! Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God!  She is humble this much toward people, although her soul is in her hand, not to speak about her house. Let us go back to the subject which we had left. When Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, found the woman at the threshold of her house, she said to her, “Why did you deny me of your house when I sent (for it)?” The woman said to her, “Moving in, you may; but show me, too, (the house) where your good will is in which I should live”. Our Lady said to her, “Let your children be removed from my house about 10 mǝʿraf. But you, do not be far from the wall (of the church) so that you may come in to me day and night because I am attracted to you because of your love to me”. The two having made this counsel, Our Lady Mary moved into the house of the chosen one. The chosen one lived where Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, showed her. May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved Son be with her maidservant Wälättä Sara forever. Amen. Getachew Haile, 1st ed., 2013.

1023,Däbrä Zämäddo miracles: Lady Maḫdärä Maryam commits suicide by hunger strike when her son steals the food for Mary's feast,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),"A miracle which Our Lady Mary worked for this chosen (woman) when she was living where she had shown her within her precinct. She lived keeping the ordinance of the house of Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God. The case of the husband of the woman was closed earlier, as she had given him up. She did not think of him again, and her children had settled where Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, had showed them. (Mary) was keeping them day and night because they were the children of her beloved one. But the chosen one did not think of them because she had held fast to the word of her Creator who has said, “Whoever has not abandoned the whole world for my sake and the sake of my Gospel …”. Therefore, Maḫdärä Maryam abandoned her husband and children, and only served Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God. And of her farm fields, she chose the best one whose crop would be ready in the month of Säne and whose grain would be 40 asfäridat. She would sow it wheat one year and barley another year. From this she would not take a single seed, but added to it. When (the crop) was wheat she would use it for bread and fetch barley for beer from elsewhere. When it was barley she would use it for beer and for bread she would think of another (source) for wheat. She did all this for the feast of Assumption. Starting from Easter Eve to the end of Fasika, she would please the clergy and the poor with food and drink. After she had celebrated (Mary’s) memorial (of Assumption) many years, her older son begged her to give him this farm field and to prepare the feast. She allowed him to make the memorial because of his great pressure. When she gave (it) to him, he abolished the preparation for the feast. At noon time on the eve of the feast day, people told her, saying, “Your son has disappeared; he is hidden from people; and the commemoration has not been thought about”. When she heard about the suspension of the feast, she went home, brought out her clothes she wears for the Communion, clothed herself (with them), stepped into her bed and called upon Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, “O Yes-Sayer! Say, ‘Yes’ to me. Come, (and) take me away, lest I see the face of the son who abolished the commemoration of the feast of Assumption”. She said this and slept, having stretched her legs straight on the bed. When the clergy gathered into church and missed her, they went (to her house), saying to each other, “How did she stay away on the feast day, she who would not interrupt going to church on normal days and was never absent from her standing place?” When they arrived, they asked the people of her household, saying, “What happened to the lady?” The people of her household replied to them, saying: “‘Come, My Lady, to take me away, lest I see the face of my disgraceful son who has abolished your feast.’ She said this at noon and slept. Her voice has not been heard after she said these words at noon”. When they (tried) to wake her up, she was found dead, as her husband had been a witness, when she sent a missive to him, saying, “After this, I shall not see your face”. At that time, he had cried bitterly because her word was one. Our Lady, too, took her, as she ordered her because she knew her mind, and there would be no change in her words. See this miracle which Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, worked! If those who are caught by severe illness ask her for life, she would raise them up immediately after they had come close to dying. And if they ask her for passing away, she would take them away immediately. She does all this because of her love for people. Other desire she has none. This woman gave an order to Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, because she knew that she loved her very much. And Our Lady took her immediately. May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved Son be with her servant Gäbrä Maryam forever and ever. Amen. Getachew Haile, 1st ed., 2013.

There is a church built in the name of Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, in the country of Śǝmrätä Ab. And there was a certain monk who lived within (the precinct of) this church, who never left the fence day or night. He was devoted to the work of God and bound with the love of Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God. During his time there was too much grief in the world. When God was wrathful at his creatures, he covered the earth with cloud and (torrential) rain until the grain harvest was lost and the entire crop of the farm lands was ruined. When people suffered tribulations exceedingly for about four months, (the monk) went into the shrine and prayed to her quietly, saying to her, “How do you keep silent although you know the weakness of man? Why do you keep silent although you are our intermediator?” He said this and left the shrine with what Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, made him understand. He said to the cloud, “Be removed!” When he said to it, “[Be removed,]” it was removed; the earth brightened and the sun came out. People could not believe it (was the sun) from the moment they saw it until it was dusk. They did not think they knew it before, because the cloud and (the torrential) rain had made them suffer tribulation by want of light and because they had suffered tribulation from cold. Therefore, they did not think that they truly saw the sun, thinking the fog would come back. But the tender-hearted (Mary) removed (it) for them by the prayer of the just, as the Scripture says, “A country is saved by the prayer of a just person”.

1025,Däbrä Zämäddo miracles: The child Qwǝrbanä Dǝngǝl and the leopard.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),"A miracle which Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, worked for a certain child in the land of Gǝbṣawit who was called Qwǝrbanä Dǝngǝl because she loves whoever is named after her name and because her Son, too, has given her the Covenant to save him. Therefore, she kept the child. One day, his mother ordered him to keep a calf. The child went to the field, taking the calf. He spent the day playing with children. In the evening, he came home; but the calf remained in the field. When he came home, his mother asked him, saying to him, “Where did the calf remain?” When she asked him, he went back to the field, but he found a leopard. He took it home beating it with a stick. He brought it to the gate of the fence. When the child was late, his mother came out to look for him. As for the leopard, whenever it came to the gate of the fence, it would be shy to enter the gate and would flee to the field. Every time it fled, the child would overtake it and beat it on its face. It was never angry, but only fled to right or left. When the mother saw the leopard removing itself and the child beating it with the stick, she said to him, “My son, leave it alone. It will come later on its own will”. The child did this in ignorance. But his mother knew that it was a leopard; she did not reveal its name, lest the child be shocked by hearing its name. See, our brothers, this miracle that Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, worked – that she worked on this child! Because the child was her trust, she did this beating of a leopard so that the power of her miracle may be revealed, although the nature of a leopard is wrathfulness. It would attack even when they slander it, not to speak of beating it. It would wound, destroy and abolish the memory of even an adult who is armed with shield and spear, not to speak of a child. As for the child, because his trust was in Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, (the leopard) did not charge him with what would commensurate the beating. It just proceeded walking and came until the gate of the house in order for the power of her miracle to be revealed. May her prayer and blessing be with her servant Gäbrä Maryam forever and ever.

1026,Däbrä Zämäddo miracles: The young Qwǝrbanä Dǝngǝl saved from an attack by the Arämi.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),"A miracle which Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, worked on this child: When he grew up and reached the age of going to school, (his parents) gave him to a teacher. As he learned, he memorized the mälkǝʿ of Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God. Having memorized it, he never recited it in silence, but by shouting loudly and in singing, from its beginning to its end. Just as the clergy perform it in church, he, too, would perform it everywhere, shouting it loudly. Wherever he went he would be identified by his shouting, when he would say, “Sälam, sälam”. He never rested from calling her name loudly from the time he went out to the field in the morning (for work) until he came back (in the evening). As many years passed, everyone knew his manner through his shouting loudly. There were Arämi in his neighborhood; these happened to look for him to kill him. When he cut wood they would follow him, but they could not find him. When he sat down, putting (the pieces of) wood together to tie them, they would encircle him. When they heard his loud shouting, they would say to each other, “What is this? Does he howl from underground? Lest we say he is in the sphere, his voice is heard (here) from the time he goes out to the field until he comes back”. He would never keep quiet from shouting, and the Arämi would never rest from looking for him. (Only) evening would separate the two. The Arämi would go back to their region and tell everyone what they had seen and heard. And when they would meet any one of the Christians, they would inquire into the matter of the shouting, “What is there in your region whose shouting looks like that of a human being, but his body is not visible to the eye? He does not do his shouting in only one place either, but he moves round hither and thither. And we would follow him by hearing his voice, thinking we would find him. When he rests, too, we would search for him diligently. At that moment, his status would not be known. (That is,) his status would not be known, whether he was under- ground or above ground. But his shouting would go on very long. And we would toil much, thinking we would find him”. When the Christians heard, they admired, saying, “The one who shouts loud is Qwǝrban and the shout is the glorification of Our Lady Mary, and his disappearance is because Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, keeps him and hides him from the eyes of killers”. This miracle that Our Lady Mary worked on the man was amazing to the Arämi and exceedingly admirable to the Christians. May her prayer and blessing be with her maidservant Wälättä Yoḥannǝs forever and ever. Amen. Getachew Haile, 1st ed., 2013.

1027,Däbrä Zämäddo miracles: The tree that wrecked havoc on the church.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),"A miracle which Our Lady Mary worked at a church built in her name in the country of Śǝmrätä Ab. The church’s precinct is very beautiful. Around the church there are (trees) that look like branches of cedar. They looked like a built wall. One of these trees widened and thickened very much. The mass of its thickness was like a small house. Its height, too, became big; it became higher than the church (building). Because of its too excessive height, it leaned toward the shrine and was on the verge of crushing it. When the clergy noticed (it), they rang the bell, and the people of the country – men, women, the old and children – assembled. They saw how the tree had leaned toward the church. They were saddened very much because the construction of the church was beautiful. They said, “What should we do with it? If we cut it at its middle it will fall on (the church) and demolish it. Nor should we leave it, behold, it is loaded on (the church) and will eventually demolish it. We are troubled on all sides. Let it be (as is); let us pray to the owner of the house because everything is possible for her”. They said this and held rogation at vespers, with broken heart and much tears. After they held the rogation, they said to her, “O mighty one, do what is best”. They said this and returned to their (respective) homes. And when the tender-hearted Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, saw their great sorrow, that same night she turned (the tree) backward. Its top went out of the fence. When day broke, people gathered to pray to her. But they found (the tree), having put its top outside the fence. They rejoiced with great joy. They [re]named [it] Our Lady Adḫanitä Om [Savior of the Tree].  Her church is called by this name. The church is present to this day.

1028,Däbrä Zämäddo miracles: The three adulterous priests who are revealed and defrocked,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),"Let us tell you a miracle which Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, worked. Listen, our brothers, to an amazing and wonderful thing that happened! There was a church in one of the countries of Ethiopia built in the name of Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, during the time of our Metropolitan Abunä Marqos. There were three priests who served in the church that we mentioned earlier. The enemy made (these priests) stumble into the act of adultery. (As a result), one begat three children, the second begat two. The third did not, but he did not stop committing adultery. They lived in this deed like an Arämi, but on the other hand, they were called priests and Mass celebrants. They were also called people of the household of Our Lady Mary. As for the people of the country, although they knew their (sinful) deeds, there was none, not one, who would say to them, “Why do you do this?” When Our Lady Mary saw that there was no one who was zealous for the law of God, she instigated the sinners themselves to reveal their sin, and she to reveal her miracle on them. (It happened) one day, and the day was the day of Bǝrhan, and the people were gathered in the church (for the occasion). As these sinners were still in the beta lǝḥem, and the time to start the celebration of the Mass was at hand, the celebrants spoke to each other, saying, “Unless people tell us our deeds, declaring whether good or bad, we shall not celebrate Mass”. When the people of the country heard the matter, they said to each other, “We do not know the duty of priests, lest we pass judgment on Mass celebrants”. (At this time) the sinners committed transgression publicly, because the enemy had stiffened their heart: they said to the people of the country, “Be excommunicated, if you do not reveal our deeds”. When the people saw and heard that they had excommunicated them, they said, “If you excommunicate us, let us tell you: you have begotten three (children); and you have begotten two (outside marriage); and you are a regular adulterer”. When these sinners heard, they said, “Now that you have told us our deeds, we will not celebrate Mass”. They said this, and buried the Communion in the ground under the altar after it was celebrated. When the people of the country saw the spoilage of the sacrifice, they took (the three priests) to the metropolitan. They came to the metropolitan and told him their concern from the beginning to the end. When the metropolitan heard and knew that what they told him was believable, he demoted (the three) from the rank of priesthood. He next brought up a point, saying, “Why did you keep silent when they sin against God, when it is not ordered in the law that sinners celebrate Mass?” The people of the country said, “What could we do? There is no other priest in our country. Therefore, we kept silent”. The metropolitan said to them, “Cancellation of the Mass is better than sanctification of the body of God in the mouth of sinners”. Furthermore, he said to them, “Have you not heard what the Scripture says, ‘Whoever is adulterous with his body is like one who sacrifices his blood to Satan’. Our Lord, too, has made us understand, saying, ‘Five dogs become one with those which are condemned to be outside’. One of these dogs is the adulterer”. The metropolitan brought them other evidence as well. He said to them, “Now tell me: Was it not because of adultery and merrymaking that (God) was angry in the time of Noah and brought the flood? Was another sin found? And was it not because of adultery that he brought down fire on Sodom in the time of Lot? The flood and fire devastated the world. But God kept the saints, Noah with his children, and Lot with his children, because they did not go along with the sinners. Why did you keep silent when the body of the Creator is oppressed, and the house of his Bearer is called the house of adulterers? It would be hated if an act of adultery was heard even against lay people, not to speak of touching the body of the Creator by the hand of a sinner (and adultery is heard) against priests”. He taught this and said to the people of the country, “Go to your respective homes. Find a priest and (re)consecrate (the church of) Our Lady Mary”. They said to him, “We cannot find one”. And he said to them, “Let her, who has expelled them by their own admission, find one”. When they came back, heaven was torn apart and a thunderbolt came down and rent the roof of the shrine. The clergy were thrown to the ground. Then they later stood up and searched for the Communion. When they searched for it, they found it being two. One (of them) was the one that was prepared for the day, and the other was the one that was buried before – (they were found) the first being on top (of the second). At that time, Our Lady Mary, Bearer of God, brought them a thought: They said to each other, “Let us celebrate the Mass with this one, and let the one from earlier stay aside, and let us take it to the metropolitan”. When the metropolitan saw, he admired and wondered. He divided it in three parts. He kept the two parts for himself and the other part he gave to the clergy. The metropolitan said to them, “Know and understand this matter and the miracle which Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways Mary, Bearer of God, worked. And hold unto this miracle firmly”. He said this and wrote it down. He ordered the adulterers never to dare touching the body of God. He (ordered) also that people make this miracle a witness like the Book of the Rite. May her prayer and blessing be with her servant Gäbrä Maryam forever and ever. Amen. Getachew Haile, 1st ed., 2013.

One of them was their father and an abbot, devoted to practicing the acts of the saints. He never left the church of Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, neither during the day nor the night. Worldly concern never crossed his mind. He never paid attention to food and drink either. And his cover was of goat-skin. As he lived devoted to Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, bugs underneath his cover tormented him. He was embarrassed to show them (to others). At that time he called Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, and said to her, “Bring me birds. No one else can deal with it”. At that moment, she brought him what he asked her and fulfilled his desire.

1030,"Däbrä Zämäddo miracles: “Keep yourself from minor things, lest you fall from big things”.",Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),"A miracle which Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, showed to the monk for whom she brought birds and arranged his house: He had disciples who attended him. His cell was near the church of Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God. Above it, there is a big cliff whose top is far for the eye. It has no path that would take one up (to the top) and bring one down. Its height is raised very high, and its breadth is wide, a walk of half a day. At the top of the cliff, there is the farm field which the disciples worked. Their behavior was very good. And Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, loved them very much, seeing the beautiful art of their (good) deeds. Due to her too much love (for them, she decided) to give them respite from the hardship of the road, because they had toiled too much in going round the cliff until they came to their farm field. When the tender-hearted Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, saw on one hand their devotion to serving in her church and on the other to working the farm field of their teacher with humility and love, she, therefore, authorized them and made them to be like the angels of God. When they went out toward their farm field, they walked up on the cliff, and when they returned toward their home, they went down on the cliff without using a rope, like Däbrä Damo, as a means of ascending and descending the cliff. They did not make a ladder either as other people do as a means for ascending and descending a mount or cliff. These holy men did not think of such means because they were given wings from the Creator and Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God. With the wings, they went out to the field and came back along the middle of the cliff. One day, as they worked their farm field, the enemy shot its arrow and stung the heart of one of the monks with the love of money: As he was working, he found a needle. (The enemy) brought him the thought of not revealing it to his brothers, keeping it by his waist. He placed it there as (the enemy) instructed him to, because the enemy had started to make him accustomed to quibbling with people.  Mar Isaac says, “Keep yourself from minor things, lest you fall from big things”. Therefore, the enemy tested him with a needle, to cut him off from the membership in the body of the saints. On that day, in the evening, they came to the edge of the cliff. His brothers went down to their home as they were used to. But the owner of the needle remained at the top of the cliff. His brothers said to him, “Why are you not coming?” He said to them, “Come, I will inform you”. When they went, he said to them, “Look at my disgrace. Because of this needle, I went down from being an angel to being below people. But (please) forgive my sin and ask Our Lady to restore me to you as she returned the angel to his former status because of the prayer of Abba Samuel of Qalamon. (Please) pray to the Lady of us all. And think about this sin and keep it in your heart so that it may be an admonition and a lesson for you, and (to be evidence) that what John Chrysostom has said is true. For he has said that there is no small or big sin. All keep one far from God. Just do not sin”. When the brothers heard this, they prayed to Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God. And on her part, she accepted their prayer and made him as before, and restored him to his brothers.

She started to make his iron tools disappear. They never stayed over a night, whether he had them made (for him) or acquired (them) or borrowed (them) from people. What the man did was not only for himself, but also for others. When he built their houses, he would suggest to them to cut (the trees from there), be it for a beam or a shutter. For whatever it was, he would not give her respite. The loss of the axe did not admonish him either. Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, having seen this, changed admonition to burning the house with fire. The fire, whether arson or one that started in their house, however it happened, would burn (the house) down. She would not let stand a single year anyone’s (house built with wood) cut from her precinct. With this, too, the man and the people of the country were not admonished either, because the enemy had thickened their hearts. When Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, saw the stubbornness of their hearts, she said to the man, and she informed the people of the country, saying to them, “This man will not live in my country; and he will not be buried inside the fence of the church”. The man went to another country. When the time came, he said, “Do not bury me inside the fence”. He said this and put them under anathema, lest they bury him inside the fence. He was buried outside the fence in the path of cows. This happened so order that the words she had told him might be fulfilled. Although he was a priest and bishop, he was buried outside the fence. Because Our Lady had said to him, “You shall not be buried inside the fence of the church”, her words that she told him have been fulfilled. May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved Son be with her servant Gäbrä Maryam forever and ever. Amen. Getachew Haile, 1st ed., 2013.

1032,Däbrä Zämäddo miracles: Chewing the body of the Son of the Blessed Virgin is not welcome to her.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),"A miracle which (Our Lady) revealed to a certain monk whose name was Ṭimona who lived in the country of the east. She informed him of the anguish in her heart, as her Son, the Savior of the World, informed Ṭimona when he was disappointed by Mäbaʾa Ṣǝyon. He had said to him, “See, Ṭimona, what Mäbaʾa Ṣǝyon has done. When my heart burnt by his love, I spat my spittle on his clothes so that I may not be separated from him day and night. [But he lent his clothes to someone else.] Now see this matter!” Ṭimona heard and called Mäbaʾa Ṣǝyon and said to him, “Why do you lend your clothes to others? Behold, the Lord himself has told me his sorrow”. Mäbaʾa Ṣǝyon said to him, “Yes, I have done (so), when people forced me to”. He said this and rolled on the ground. He said to (Ṭimona), “What will be of me after this, if my Lord is disappointed with me?” Ṭimona said to him, “Do not despond, my son, because Our Lord is merciful. Only let us pray to him”. He said this and made peace between them and reconciled them. Our Lady, too, knowing that Ṭimona was a beloved one to her Son, asked him, saying to him, “What should I do, and what will be of me? My mind shivers and my heart melts like wax before fire when people chew the flesh of my Son with their teeth. What shall I do with this my Son? First the Jews crucified him on a wood and pierced him with a spear, and now people chew him with (their) teeth”. Ṭimona said to her, “What should people do? Your Son has said, ‘Eat my flesh’, and now you inspire fear in me. What should we do?” Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, said to him, “Let them knead it with their palate and tongue like a grape. Chewing, however, is not right”. Our Lady said this and kept silent. When Ṭimona heard, he said, “This sin would be a sin of bishops and priests, if they prepare (the Eucharistic bread) solid like a stone. Let them prepare it soft like a cluster of grapes that would be easy for the palate and tongue to knead. If this is chewed, it would be a sin of the laity”. Hold unto this miracle firmly and keep it in your heart. Do not consider it a fiction and idle talk, because Our Lady does not talk idle, but tells about the life of the soul.

1033,Däbrä Zämäddo miracles: Abbot Maḫdärä Krǝstos who left his office on his own volition.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),"A miracle which Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, worked at Däbrä Zämäddo: There was a certain monk whose name was Maḫdärä Krǝstos who loved Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, and who served in her church. When they appointed him bishop for her church, he upheld its orders and laws, and pleased the people of her household. He even left his office on his own volition, not demoted but while people begged him, saying, “Do not leave your office, because you please both God and people”. But he said to them, “(Please) let me go; when the time in office is prolonged, negligence will prevail. At that time man quarrels with his Creator”. He said this, and left his office. When (the monk) grew old, he thought of his passing away and started digging his grave outside the church, very far from the church. Since Our Lady does not forget her love to whoever loves her in faith, at that time, she sent him a missive, saying to him, “Why do you dig outside? Will you not be buried inside the shrine?” The man said, “How would I be buried inside the shrine when I am a sinner and filthy? How would I be buried in the dwelling of my Lords?” He said this and persisted in digging. The messenger of Our Lady Mary said to him, “Your toil (in digging) will be in vain”. Next, he made a prophecy to follow: “If you rest before me, I will bury you inside the shrine, where My Lady has shown me. And if I die before you, she herself would know”. The monk finished what he started, and lived many years. He became like children in innocence. He came to a state he did not distinguish good from bad. He forgot even fasting and prayer, lest he put people under excommunication, saying, “Bury me where I have built (my grave)”. When he rested, brothers buried him inside the shrine, on the right of the altar, because Our Lady had directed earlier there the man whom she sent, saying to him, “Why will you be buried far from me? For you are my beloved one”. Her words were fulfilled as she had told him. O brothers, see the amount of her love! Whether one served her a little or loved her much, if his mind went astray, she will bring him back to the inner side of her house. And if one despises her words a bit, and disregards her precepts, she will keep him far from her precinct and blessing. O Our Lady, may your prayer and blessing keep us, the children of your household; And make us partake in the banquet of your Son. And may your sojourn in Qwǝsqwam be a guardian to us.

1034,Däbrä Zämäddo miracles: The density of trees at Mäbaʾa Ṣǝyon church that prevented two boys from dying in a fire,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),"A miracle which Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, worked at a church built in her name in the country of Śǝmrätä Ab: Listen, my brothers! Let us tell you the miracle she worked, just as her Son worked for his beloved Mäbaʾa Ṣǝyon. (At that time) when a woman came to (Mäbaʾa Ṣǝyon), carrying her sick child on her back, and said to him, “Take this child and heal him by your prayer, and let him be your servant”, he said to her, “I myself am a servant of My Lord. How do I accept a servant? But give him to his Lord, the Savior of the World”. The woman heard and said, “Let it be as you said”. At that time he put in (the child’s) mouth crumbs from (the food prepared for) the memorial of the Savior of the World. At that moment, (the child) vomited what looked like charcoal and scorpions. After that, when he recovered (from vomiting), he became well. One day, as he and his brother were asleep in one bed, embracing each other, both covered with one blanket, the house was on fire at midnight. Those who heard went out and fled from the fire. The (two) children remained – because sleep had killed them – because they did not hear. The next morning, the people of the country gathered with the father (of the children), and cleared the (other) ash to bury their ash. They found them; they found the trust of Our Savior alive, but the second was found being ash. Look at this miracle! Our Lady Mary, too, showed (a similar miracle) in her church which we described earlier, saying, “The construction of the church and its foundation were beautiful”. Its trees were many, very dense and tall, higher than the church (building). Because of their excessive height, they prevented the sun from entering the fence of the church. People who came to church said to each other, “If we cut the branches of the trees, Our Lady will be angry with us. And if we leave them so, when they drip water in the season of Krämt, they would wear out the church before its time. And in the season of Ḥagay, every leaf of the trees comes down on the church. This (too) would wear it out. We, too, when we come out after service, could not find the sun inside the fence. We do not find sun, unless we go far outside the fence”. They lived on saying (so) to each other. And Our Lady Mary, as she is a lover of people, caused fire to start in the field, far from the church, to fulfill (people’s) wish and to reveal the power of her miracle. This Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God – because she is saddened when people are saddened and hears them quickly when they pray to her – brought the fire quickly to her precinct. It met with its trees. Every tree present in the compound of the church was burnt down. The charcoal came down on the church, and the flame was repeatedly moving hither and thither above the church. The people of the country wailed from far, saying, “How did you do (so), Our Lady? Because of our sin, you burnt down your own church and the tabot named after your name. How did you put your own church on fire while all your property is in it?” Saying so, they spent the night, starting at three in the afternoon until morning, and the trees burning. In the morning, people came close to see the condition of the church; they found it well. None of her properties was burnt save for the trees which prevented the sun, which were like a canopy over the church and would wear it out by their drips before its time. As for the charcoal which was cut from the trees and dropped on the church, its ash was found becoming a pile. When they cleared the ash, they found the straw (of the roof) well. Even its color was not changed, not to speak of it being burnt. See this miracle! While fire burns wet trunks, it does not touch dry grass when the power of Our Lady prevents it. May your prayer and petition save us, too – as they saved your church from the fire – From the love of the world, the snare, Which looks permanent, although it is like a shadow. Forever and ever.

1035,Däbrä Zämäddo miracles: The man who refused to observe holy days.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),"Let us tell you a miracle which Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, worked: There was a certain man during the time of Zäwäldä Maryam. The man was, indeed, Christian in name, but in deeds he was outside the Christian law. His home country was below Wägrä Sǝḫin, the city of the saints. Although he lived in the city of the saints, he never participated with the saints in deeds; he rather lived in the deeds of the Arämi. He knew neither fast nor prayer nor any order of the church. He did not obey the clergy either. When they said to him, “Today is a holy day” or “Today is the holy day of Our Lady, it is not right to work (on it)” – when they said (so) to him – he would ridicule them. When one day, on 3 Gǝnbot, the holy day of Our Lady’s entrance in the Temple, he went out to work the farm field, the clergy said to him, “It is not right; it is forbidden, lest her holy day be abolished”, he mocked and went out to the field. He spent (most of) the day plowing. At 3 o’clock, (a whirl) wind with a storm rain started. It spun the man (in the air) where he was working and dropped him down with his oxen, as he held the plow in his hand. When he landed on the wide field, the earth opened its mouth and swallowed him up with his oxen. He became the likeness of Dathan and Abiram. See the power of Our Lady which made him like Jezebel, the origin of arrogance, daughter of Beliar, and like Läyabo, the blasphemer! O Our Lady, save me, with your prayer and petition from drowning in the sea of sin. And make me do what pleases your Son, And observe silence, the mother of good things. Forever and ever. Amen.

1036,Däbrä Zämäddo miracles: The greedy man who did not observe holy days.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),"A miracle which Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, worked (against a certain man) who lived between the two Mount Sǝḫins: He was a lover of money. Although his money was a lot, he never felt that he earned a single seed of grain. Also his farm fields, which he farmed in many countries, were plenty. With this his toil, he did not give respite to the weak. And he never offered to the church even a bit, neither for sacrifice nor incense that would be for the salvation of his soul. To the contrary, if he found any church property, he would take (it) for himself. Because of his too much love for money, he abolished holy days, thinking he would earn plenty. One day, on the holy day of Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, he sowed his farm field. On the holy day of the Holy Trinity, too, he sowed while people told him not to. He again sowed his farm land on the holy day of Our Mother Saint Hannah. He refused and sowed while people told him not to. When harvest time arrived, and when (the grains of) this farm field, too, was ready to be cut, Our Lady brought locust, and the whole country was troubled. They held rogation. The locust left the farm fields of the people of the country because they were not sowed on her holy day. The locust did not devour (anything) but the farm field of the violator. See what Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, had done! In that farm field not (even) gleanings were found. It became as if it were not sown. And also the money in his house was lost, with no fire consuming it or a robber robbing it. And his cattle did not come back from the field to which they went out but were destroyed where they were. After all his property was lost, his wife died, and he remained alone with too much misery. His age of vigor, too, passed away, and he became (too) old. See the power of Our Lady! She allowed the earth to swallow one miser, and she made the other live (long) on the earth to experience devastation and hardship. Since (this man) was a boaster by his might as well as money, she made him remain alone to know his limits, that he was weak. May her prayer and her blessing and the mercy of her beloved Son be with her servant Gäbrä Maryam forever and ever. Amen. Getachew Haile, 1st ed., 2013.

1037,Däbrä Zämäddo miracles: The righteous Wäldä Ḥawaryat whom the Blessed Virgin comforted.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),"A miracle which Our Lady revealed and spoke to a certain monk called Wäldä Ḥawaryat: He came from Däbrä Libanos and lived in Däbrä Zämäddo in seclusion. He was versed in the Scriptures and was practicing them. He was truly Wäldä Ḥawaryat. One day, he entered the chapel of the icon of Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, to mourn, remembering the crucifixion of her Son, because this was his habit. Whenever he remembered the sufferings of the Son of God, his energy would be weakened and his bones would be crushed. His tears, too, would come down like water from a fountain; and they would flow from his eyes like the rain of the time of Krämt and run down to his waist and reach his feet. The ground on which he stood would be wet with his tears. One day, as he was crying, Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, said to him, “Wäldä Ḥawaryat, why do you shed so many tears so that the ground is wetted?” He said to her, “O My Lady, I remember the sufferings of your Son”. And she said to him, “Was my Son crucified for you only? Was he not crucified for the whole world?” She said this and disappeared from him. Saintly people, whom Our Lady loved, heard her and wrote down this miracle. They also explained the matter to us: They said, “The reason she said, ‘Why do you shed so many tears’ was not for trivializing (the importance of) tears, but to strengthen (Wäldä Ḥawaryat) from exhaustion and to show the strength of her love to all people who put their trust in her”. May her prayer and petition keep Wäldä Iyyäsus forever and ever. Amen. Getachew Haile, 1st ed., 2013.

1038,Däbrä Zämäddo miracles: The righteous Wäldä Ḥawaryat and the glory of Maḫlet.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),"Another miracle which Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, revealed to Wäldä Ḥawaryat: While he was reading the Maḫletä Ṣǝge, standing before the tabot inside the shrine, the clergy started singing from their usual standing place. At that moment, Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, stood up and said to him, “Wäldä Ḥawaryat, I am going to my sons who have started the maḫlet in order to stand with them and strengthen them from their exhaustion”. Wäldä Ḥawaryat said to her, “Why do you not reply to me a word, nor strengthen me from exhaustion, although I always stand before you and recite your praises? Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, said to him, “Wäldä Ḥawaryat, do not say so. But you, when you pray, you do so standing in seclusion and in silence. Do you not see how much their toil is?” She said this and went to the clergy who performed the maḫlet. Wäldä Ḥawaryat, too, followed her to see what she was going to do. When he came, he saw her handing them sistrums and the drum. When they sweated she rubbed their faces with her scarf and with her handkerchief. And when the maḫlet was fin- ished, she collected the sistrums from their hands. She also brought the drum down from their neck with her hand. After he saw this miracle (Wäldä Ḥawaryat) loved the maḫlet, and honored it in his mind. He became a witness also before others – that singing with the drum and songs is better than glorifying and praising in silence. He, too, kept it firmly for himself. He decided not to pray alone at the time of maḫlet, but stood with the clergy who toiled. At the end of his years, he told all people the glory of maḫlet, and how Our Lady loves it when they perform it in meekness, void of haughtiness and vain glory. May her prayer and her blessing and the mercy of her beloved Son be with her maidservant Wälättä Sara forever and ever. Amen. Getachew Haile, 1st ed., 2013.

1039,Däbrä Zämäddo miracles: The thief who stole and sold the lectern from the church.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),"A miracle of Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, which she worked and showed her power on a thief: He stole her lectern and brought it to Maḫdärä Krǝstos, the ruler of Ṭäṭära. When the ruler saw it, he was exceedingly happy, because it was beautiful, one soaked and dyed in paint. (The ruler) gave the thief a lot of money for its price. Because of his great happiness, the ruler summoned the people of his household, men as well as women, and assembled them and said to them, “See, I have acquired what would not be found even in palaces”. One young man, whose name was Täklä Haymanot, replied to his master, saying to him, “Does not this property belong to Our Lady of Däbrä Zämäddo, which is exhibited with her icon at the honoring of her holy day, and the whole world sees it?” The ruler heard and called the thief and asked him, “Where did you bring it from?” The thief said, “I brought it from Däbrä Zämäddo”. The ruler heard and admired the power of Our Holy Lady. He said, “If I had not summoned the people of my household, and if I had not shown this property to them, who would have told me that it was the property of Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God?” All the people said, “But this wisdom is not others’ but Our Lady’s”.

When the thief came to the land of Wäsan, he bolted to flee. The young man threw his spear and hit (the thief’s) two legs with the spear. (The thief) fell down by the power of God. The young man raised him up and took him to Däbrä Zämäddo and presented him to the abbot. The abbot assembled the people of the monastery and asked them what they should do with the thief. Some said, “Let us execute him”. And some said, “Let us amputate his hands and feet”. But Abunä Ṣama Iyyäsus said, “Let us let him go. Let Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God do with him whatever she wants, as she has brought him there”.

1040,Däbrä Zämäddo miracles: King Lalibäla and his Godson.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),"A miracle that Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, showed and revealed a secret to the meek, and kind like his God, the famous King Lalibäla, whose regnal name is Gäbrä Mäsqäl, regarding his son whom he begat in two ways: one is that (the child) was the son of his brother in flesh, and the other is that (King Lalibäla) was (his) guardian in the Holy Spirit. He took him from the bosom of his mother and kept him with him. When he took him from the bosom of his mother, his mother was saddened because of her separation, for the child was small, just three years old. His mother’s eyes were not satiated with seeing him. As for the child, he never ate anything from the delight of this world, but earth. Even the earth, he never ate but only on Sabbaths. The people of the country said about him, “This child, the son of the king, looks like start of the sky because he eats and drinks whatever he wants”. On this (assumption), they said, “His beauty is superb”. But the child never ate anything. He tied his waist with a goat tether. No one knew his asceticism but his spiritual father. Indeed, his father knew his secret – that he did not eat anything. One day, as (the child) was sleeping with his father Lalibäla, Lalibäla searched the child at his waist and found his waist tied with a goat tether, but it being like linen. Lalibäla lamented and cried when he saw the torment the child was under. At that moment, Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, came and appeared to Lalibäla [and said to him], “Why do you cry and break the heart of the child?” And she made a point next, saying to him, “Regarding the Kingdom of my Son, people do not find it being subservient to food and drink. Only the righteous find it when their body becomes like a dried bark of a tree and like the green mallow of the time of drought, due to too much fasting, repeated prostration to the ground, and too much starvation and thirst. People find it only this way”. Saying this, Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, made Lalibäla abandon his sorrow. Us, too, may she save by her prayer from the jaw of the lion and the wolf forever and ever. Amen. Getachew Haile, 1st ed., 2013.

1041,Däbrä Zämäddo miracles: The Blessed Virgin informs Näʾakkwǝto Läʾab about his future.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),"A miracle which (Our Lady) revealed to our King Näʾakkwǝto Läʾab (about what would happen) when he became an adult: She prophesized about him and explained to him things which would happen to him later. She said to him, “O child, the beloved one of my Son, and my beloved, too, stay firm and go on contending in this your contending, and bring to an end what you have started. Do not retreat from your toil. On my part, I shall keep you; I will not be separated from you day or night”. And she explained to him one thing related to prophecy: She said to him, “This, your father Lalibäla, will give you his kingship while he is alive. Then he will take (it) back from you. At that time, do not feel sad; have patience. Let not your heart be angry either. He will again return your kingship to you. On your part, when you receive the kingship, go hunting wild animals. (When you do), a white partridge will take off from the country of Dänsa and will enter into a grotto. Follow it, and go into the grotto. When you enter, you will find the partridge. At that time, catch it and slaughter it. And sprinkle its blood in the grotto. Let not your soldiers eat its flesh, but bury it in the grotto. After that, make a pavement there and build (on it) a church in my name, and bring in a tabot in my name”. She said this and disappeared from him. When the time (for the fulfillment of) the prophesy, which Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God prophesized, was at hand, Lalibäla gave him his kingship while he was alive. Then he took it away from him because of a cow of a poor man, which his soldiers took while Näʾakkwǝto Läʾab did not know. He was not angry when his father took away his kingship. He was neither sad nor angry because he was humble. The love of (this) world had never ascended his heart. And the words which she told him earlier were fulfilled, including everything she revealed to him when her Son sent a missive, saying, “Know your wife as Adam knew Eve, because there is a blessed child in your loin”. When he heard (the missive), he said, “How would I abolish my priesthood, while I am a partner of the Seraphim in incensing the throne of (the Lord of) the Sabaoth? I will not do this thing”. Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, said to him, “Why do you refuse to obey the order of my Son? If you do my Son’s order, neither your priesthood shall be abolished nor you virginity lost. And comfort your wife, because she would be sad about her virginity. Say to her, ‘Your virginity, too, will not be lost.’” She said this and disappeared from him. See her humility, my brothers! Although she is the Queen of Heaven and Earth, when someone is sad, she visits him and comforts him. May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved Son defend us before Alpha, and make us inherit an inheritance with Saul and Cephas, Forever and ever. Amen. Getachew Haile, 1st ed., 2013.

1042,Däbrä Zämäddo miracles: The three monks who starved in the cell that once belonged to the Holy Family.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),"A miracle which Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, revealed to a certain monk whose name was Bäkwrä Ṣǝyon, where he took hermitage with his four (spiritual) brothers: People claim that Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, had lived in the cell in which he took hermitage. (It is said that) when she fled from the cursed Herod, she (first) went to Egypt and from there she came to the country of Ethiopia and lived in that cell seven months with her beloved Son (and) with Joseph and Salome. When these (four) monks heard the history of this cell – that Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, had lived in it – they led their hermitage in it, to pray to her for the salvation of their souls. They lived in it five years, combating, in much toil and affliction, because there was no food in the cell. And the desert was (too) far from people. After they lived five years, (the enemy) incited the four monks, and caused them to think (of leaving). They said, “Let us tour the desert. If we find wayfarers, we shall ask them to bless us and comfort us regarding the concern in our heart”. But Bäkwrä Ṣǝyon strengthened his trust in Our Lady. He said, “I will not look for a blessing from others, but from Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God. I will look for her blessing, if I (deserve to) find it. If not, I will die here”. He said this and remained alone. And they went to where they intended. Early next morning, as he was there alone, (Our Lady) came to him. She met him and comforted him concerning the sorrow in his heart. She said to him, “Go to the land of Lalibäla, for the Creator has ordered your grave to be there”. She said this and ascended into (fol. 149r) the heavens. And the monk went to where she ordered him. He rested there and was buried by the church of Mädḫane ʿAläm. See, my brothers, how a person with two hearts and whose mind wavers, saying, “Would I get (what I want) or would I not”, will stay away from the hope in Our Lady and the mercy of Our Lord. The other monks were separated from finding her and seeing her because of the deficiency of their heart (manifested) in looking for a hope from others. But Bäkwrä Ṣǝyon, who strengthened his trust in Our Lady without doubt, earned Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, to the end.

1043,Däbrä Zämäddo miracles: King Zärʾa Yaʿǝqob rebuked for leaning against the wall of the church.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),"A miracle which Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, explained, and revealed secrets of the church to the righteous and faithful King Zärʾa Yaʿǝqob  when he entered a church: The church was built in the name of Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God. When he stood before her tabot to pray and leaned against a column, she admonished him, saying, “Why do you push me? Do not press on me!” Listen, my brothers! Comprehend this matter. Was not this column, which spoke this to him, a stone? (But) do you think that stone has really a tongue? God forbid! Rather, Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, imitator of many objects, spoke to him instead of the column. A talk by a stone has never been heard since the beginning. Until now there was not found any among the saints who talked with a stone, not one was found. However, (rocks) had sprung water for them, when they struck them. But talking (with a stone) belonged to Our Lady to explain to (the king) that it is not right (to do so) in church. She explained to him that people should not lean against a wall, sitting or standing, so we may believe her words. The construction of the ten churches by Lalibäla is evidence for us that leaning in church is not right. Now check for yourself, if you could find one (church) for which he had built a column. He avoided building columns when he realized that leaning in church is not right. He would have built (columns), if it were right. O brothers, what will she, who said to the righteous and meek Zärʾa Yaʿǝqob, “Do not push me”, do to us who spread ourselves like a board and sleep like a dead person? And when we wake up, we entertain ourselves in backbiting and in vain jest. O my brothers, comprehend the lesson of the Lady of all.

1044,Däbrä Zämäddo miracles: Qwǝrbanä Dǝngǝl inflicted by the consequences of aging.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),"A miracle which Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, of Däbrä Zämäddo worked for a certain monk, whose name was Qwǝrbanä Dǝngǝl, whom she had saved before from the devouring leopard and also from a killer Arämi, and whom she had kept since his youth from every difficulty, as she also did from the snare of the enemy when he grew old and his energy had waned. One day, at midnight, (the enemy) came to the old man and said to him, “Stand up, father; let us go to church, because today is New Year. People are waiting for you. Stand up; let us go”. The old man said to him, “The night is too heavy; it is still dark. How can I go?” The enemy said to him, pretending to be one of the boys of the old man’s household, “The night is over; I will also put on a torch for you”. (The enemy) made him think that he had put the light on. So the old man said, “Alright”, because the enemy had deranged his mind. He brought him out of his house and took him in the direction of the church. Soon  they came to the juncture of (two) roads (one of which) would take one to the right and (the other) to the left. The one on the right leads to beneath the church, and it is near the church. The one on the left leads to above the shrine. The old man said, “Let us take the road on the right”. But the enemy said, “How can we enter (now through the front door)? For the worldly people are gathered at the door of the church. They will criticize us, saying, ‘How did they sleep until day break?’ Let us rather go over the church. We will enter the shrine by the betä lǝḥem, without people seeing us”. He said this and took him by the road on the left. When they came above the church, at the watercourse, the old man remembered his habit of a long time. He used to recite the Mystagogia when he rose up from sleep until he came to church. On that day he did not re- member this prayer until he came (close) to the church, because the enemy had made him forget. The old man said in his heart, “What happened to me today, that I abandoned my prayer. He said this and (started) next (to recite it), saying, “Bäʾǝtä tǝmhǝrtä ḫǝbuʾat …”.The enemy said to him, “What, other than this, your prayer, would burn me!” He said this and struck him on his neck with an iron stick, and hurled him into the watercourse. He was thrown flat down at the door of the church. Two saintly monks who were inside the shrine heard him. They thought a boulder had come down, ripped off from the top of the cliff. As they wondered, saying, “What is it that was thrown on the ground?” they immediately heard the words of Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, when she said to him, “zä-Qwǝrbanä, zä-Qwǝrbanä, my son, my beloved one, the beloved of my Son, my lyre, the fiddle of my praise, do not be afraid, because nothing evil will happen to you, because I keep you”. She said this and touched his body. And he rose up as a sleeping person rises from bed and entered the shrine. Neither the strike of the enemy nor the falling flat on the ground from the cliff hurt him at all because his Lady had touched him. May her prayer and her blessing and the mercy of her beloved Son be with her servant Gäbrä Maryam forever and ever. Amen. Getachew Haile, 1st ed., 2013.

1045,Däbrä Zämäddo miracles: The monks of Däbrä Zämäddo at the verge of abandoning the monastery. (duplicate?),Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),"Listen, my brothers! Let us tell you the words of a miracle she caused the people of Däbrä Zämäddo to hear and she comforted them: They lived in meekness; they did not recognize the bodily nature nor were they in servitude to it. They were not interested (in anything) but in prayer and repeated prostration in worship. The men, but few, never worked the farm field. Neither did the women know manual work, but were (devoted) only to prayer and repeated prostration in worship. The men as well as the women never toiled with their bodies in search of food and clothes. Therefore, want of the body tortured them for disregarding manual work. Our Lady saw their mind going up and down, in saying, “Should we (or should we not) leave this monastery and go where food for the body is found?” The mind of some said, “It is better for us to die here than leave our country”. When Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, saw the determination in their heart, she called them with her own voice from air at noon while everyone was hearing it. The voice called them, saying, “People of Zämäddo, people of Zämäddo”. And they replied, saying, “Now, speak out; we will hear you”. The voice said to them, “Both market places are not to be found – of the earth and of the heaven, delight of the body and life of the soul. Both market places are not to be found – interest in wealth of the body, accumulating worldly property, and being (spiritually) richer than all the poor, hoping in the mind to find the delight of the Kingdom of Heaven. Both market places are not to be found”. Her voice became silent after it said this. And the saints heard and understood the interpretation of what (the voice) said, “Both market places are not to be found”. They earned the Kingdom of Heaven with their poverty. They ignored eating and drinking for the sake of the love for Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God. May her prayer and her blessing and the mercy of her beloved Son be with her maidservant Ǝlleni Nǝgǝśt, forever and ever. Amen. Getachew Haile, 1st ed., 2013.

1046,Däbrä Zämäddo miracles: The leopard which dug out tombs and ate the corpses.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),"A miracle which Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, worked during the time of (abbot) Fäqadä Krǝstos, when wild animals wrecked havoc, by opening tombs and eating the dead, entering the church: When the people of the country, the priest and monks, noticed, they told their father, saying, “In the evening, we leave having closed the doors of the church; and in the morning we find them still closed. But we find the tomb open, and the human cadaver is found cut off from it. Entering through where does it eat it? This thing has perturbed us very much”. A monk, called Säfane Krǝstos, said to them, “One day, as I entered into the church at noon, I saw a leopard exiting from the shrine, jumping over the chapel of Täklä Haymanot. It exited and went to the field. When Abunä Fäqadä Krǝstos heard, he said to his children, “Come, let us pray to Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, with Sälamä Gabrǝʾel mälʾak, because when our ancient fathers were very distressed, they would pray to her with this prayer. And she would listen to them quickly and remove the sorrow in their heart. Therefore, today, too, let us pray to her with this prayer, peradventure she will not ignore us because of the multitude of our sin”. He said this and recited the Sälamä Gabrǝʾel mälʾak with his children seven times. And he ordered the people of the monastery to pray with this prayer seven days. Our Lady is a receiver of the prayer of any one, and is especially definitely partial toward the people of her household. On the third day since this prayer was started, they saw the animal three times in one day, as he went round the church. On the fourth day since this prayer was started, he was found dead inside the chapel of Ignatius. See the miracles of Our Lady, how she hears our prayer and removes our sorrow! You, too, pray to her always so she may rescue us from the waves of this world. May her prayer and her blessing and the mercy of her beloved Son be with her servant Gäbrä Maryam forever and ever.

1047,Däbrä Zämäddo miracles: Wälättä Nǝgǝśt whom the Blessed Virgin saved from a raid by the Arämi.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),"There is a church in the country of Śǝmrätä Ab built in the name of Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God. At that church there was a woman whose name was Wälättä Nǝgǝśt. She loved Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God. She was also a lover of the poor. Her hands were open to give whatever she would get. And she never interrupted going to church, day or night. One day, she said to Our Lady, “O My Lady, I need to go to another country to take care of my needs. When I accomplish my desire, I will return here. If your heart consents, go before me and follow me because I have no helper other than you. And I have no other keeper either other than you”. She said this and left for where she thought (to go). The country to which she went was a neighbor of the Arämi. And these Arämi always fought with the people of the country to which the woman went. A few days after she arrived at that country, she went to (her) farm field because it was harvest season. The people of the country, too, went out with their many cows to harvest the crop. As they were harvesting, the Arämi came suddenly and found the Christians with their cattle, unprepared to fight. People fled immediately, but the woman remained with the cattle because she was unable to run. The Arämi took the cows as booty. They found (the woman) in the midst the cattle. They left her there and went one mǝʿraf. (Then) they returned to her and stood before her. In order that Our Lady Mary may show her pow- er with this tactic, her power prevented them from taking her captive. And it seemed to them that they had gotten a captive, lest they leave her. Therefore, they returned repeatedly, and the worldly people watched from far as (the Arämi) returned to her repeatedly. And they saw the woman standing in the middle of the wide field. The conclusion of the story is that the Arämi went to their country. They left her, although they had seen her. The appearance of the woman looked like the cluster of rose fruit and her face shined like the ray of the sun. The Arämi left her – although they had seen her – when the power of Our Lady prevented them because she does not forget what one asks her. For she had (asked) her before, saying, “Keep me where I went”. Therefore, she kept her. And the woman came back to her country, and told what Our Lady had done for her – how she saved her from the hand of the Arämi. May her prayer and her blessing and the mercy of her beloved Son be with her servant Gäbrä Maryam forever and [ever. Amen]. Getachew Haile, 1st ed., 2013.

1048,Däbrä Zämäddo miracles: Abbot Abunä Sinodos whom people opposed to cut the hab tree.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),"A miracle which Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, worked at Däbrä Zämäddo for Abunä Sinodos who was called Wäldä Yoḥannǝs when he was appointed keeper and legislator of the law of Däbrä Zämäddo: The water that came down on the grotto used to trouble the church. It troubled it very much, starting with the beginning of the Krämt until the month of Mäskäräm. At other months, too, it would trouble it if it rained. When Abunä Wäldä Yoḥannǝs saw this during the time of his tenure, he wanted to improve the way the water streamed and to build a pavement at the mouth of the grotto. He searched for wood that would go on par with the pavement. People reported to him, saying, “There is a hab tree at the top of the mountain that can be good for this construction”. Hearing this, Abunä Sinodos went with many people to cut the hab tree. When the people of the country heard that he went to cut the hab tree, they came together and went to the tree. They found our father having arrived there. They said to him, “Unless you first kill us, we will neither be quiet nor let you cut it”. Abunä Wäldä Yoḥannǝs said to them, “Why do you think evil? Is not our church for us all as well? And is it not the abode of Our Lady Mary? How did the enemy make you think of an evil matter? Leave this matter”. Those who opposed him said to him, “Your words are not sweet to us. As for leaving, you leave, (not we). If you want to cut it, kill us first. But while we see, we will not let you cut it”. When Wäldä Yoḥannǝs heard these, their evil words, he was very sad. He said (to himself), “If I insist on cutting it, these people will clash with my people. And people could die because of this”. He said this, and having counseled with himself, he abandoned cutting the tree and left for home, saddened and distressed. See this humility of this father, and meekness of his heart and his love for people! He did not want to cut it by force. Even though he was the ruler of these people and a huge host had followed him, he chose to abandon cutting the tree. He only said to Our Lady, “See the crooked- ness of these people! What does that tree in the wilderness benefit them? Would it not be better for them, if your house was constructed?” As for Our Lady, she heard and kept silent (for the moment). She was patient for three days. When she saw these people’s stubbornness of the heart – that they neither humbled themselves nor turned from their wicked counsel – despite the fact that their father exhibited meekness, and their ruler humbled himself, she made the tree fall from its root and be divided it into three parts, without a human hand touching it. When people heard (it), they brought to Abunä Sinodos the good news of the fall of the tree from its root. And those people who prevented its cutting humbled themselves after its fall from its root, (humility) void of praise. They said to Abunä Wäldä Yoḥannǝs, “Do what you want to do”. He said, disappointed in his heart, “This praise, after the fall of the tree from its root, is not for people but for God and his Bearer, Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God”. As she moved (the church of) Däbrä ʿƎqwäna,  she moved the tree in the same fashion. But she did not damage the foundation (of the church) of Däbrä ʿƎqwäna when she moved it; she only took it from place to place; and there, she kept it firmly as before. But her moving of this tree was not for a good (reason) but for its destruction. And she cut it into such (useless) parts. And its end was not good. She made the tree fall from its root to show her power, because of the diligence and righteousness (of Abunä Sinodos) and his servitude to Our Lady Mary. Its end was not good also because of the crookedness of the people, because ruse destroys the straight path. And (the abbot) could not improve this building (using) the tree because its cutting was not done peacefully (but only) because he loved (Mary) and because of the straight- ness of his mind. She saw his love for her, and it moved it from its place; but because of the crookedness of the people, she did not accept it. And so its end was not good. If the beginning (of anything) is not with love, its end will not be good. See this miracle which Our Lady Mary worked! Lest people say about her, “She does not help her beloved ones”, she removed (the tree) from its place to show her love to Abunä Sinodos. And lest the people who quarrelled before say, “She is a lover of money”, she (arranged) that (her) people would not cut it. Therefore, the end (of the tree) was not good. May her prayer and her blessing and the mercy of her beloved Son be with her servant Gäbrä Maryam forever and ever. Amen. Getachew Haile, 1st ed., 2013.

1049,Däbrä Zämäddo miracles: The woman who received the answer to her prayer through her support stick.,Africa Ethiopia confirmed (Dabra Zamaddo),"A miracle which Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, worked at her church built in her name in the country of Śǝmrätä Ab: There was a chosen woman there who loved Our Lady Mary and her Son Jesus Christ. She never left the church either by day or by night before the priest blessed with the concluding words, [saying, “May] God [be with you all”]. They used to give her, where she stood, one support stick out of their support sticks which they use at their standing place. They designated that stick “the stick of the woman”. When the clergy would leave the church, she would give the stick back to them, and they would put it together with their sticks. Now, this was their usual custom.  On one of the days, the woman thought to go to the place of the saints to pay homage to the place of the saints and to receive their blessing. She thought of this and prayed to Our Lady Mary, saying to her, “Give me a sign, if it is your will that I go. If it is not your will, give me a sign so I may remain”. She said this and went home. As she entered the church (precinct) the next day, she found the stick outside the wall. She picked it up, wondering, saying, “Who brought it out?” She said this and brought it in with her. That day, too, she left it with their support sticks. And the next day, she found it outside and brought it in, wondering as before, and left it with their support sticks. The next day she found it (outside) as before. When this thing happened three days, she asked the clergy, saying, “Do you take the stick out?” They said to her, “No”. After this, she took a spiritual priest aside from people, and told him how she prayed to Our Lady Mary to allow her to go to another country. The priest heard and said to her, “This matter (shows that) it is the good will of Our Lady Mary. Go where you intended to. And take the stick with you. Verily, she has given you the stick”. The woman left. When she arrived where she intended to, (Our Lady) appeared to her that same night and said to her, “There are two distressed people in this country. Tell them, (saying,) ‘Our Lady Mary says to you do not feel distressed. Regarding your distress, I know about it. I will mitigate it for you, because you are my servants. I do not forget what one asks me earlier.’” After she told them this message – that she had sent her for – she proceeded to where she intended to. And they heard the word that Our Lady Mary had sent (to them) through the woman. They heard and said (with some doubt), “We will see it, if it is true!” In those days, Our Lady Mary appeared to one of the two distressed people. At noon, as he was standing in church, she arrived openly with Abunä Gäbrä Mänfäs Qǝddus, and said to him, “Believe what the woman has told you. It is true. Truly, it is my word that I sent to tell you. Today, too, I shall defend you. I shall not leave you to remain distressed”. She said this and disappeared from his eyes. See the miracles of Our Lady! She does not abandon those who love her nor ignore them. She brought the woman where she wanted (to go). And she calmed those distressed people from the disturbance of the enemy. May her prayer and her blessing and the mercy of her beloved Son be with her servant Gäbrä Maryam forever and ever. Amen. Greetings to you, you deserve praise, With the people of your household of the Monastery of Däbrä Zämäddo. You, who are in body and who are in the soul.

For you I created Adam from the four elements. ...After saying this, he became quite. Our Lady Mary rose and went as she rejoiced because of all the covenant he gave her. She reached the town of Tsimor. When the people of that town saw her, they said amongst themselves ""That is the wife of a physician (sorcerer) about whom we heard that she turns people into baboons. Come. Let us stone her so that she might not enter  into our town."" They picked up stones and stoned our Lady Mary. She rose her hands and blessed. The stone returned back to those who stoned her.

1069,"(New) Holy Family cycle: 6. Those eaten by their dogs or turned into dogs are restored to life by Mary, at Joseph and baby Jesus's request, and provided with clothing.",Africa Ethiopia confirmed,"[in Google doc not here] Continuation of previous story. Two months after the dogs ate the people, Joseph prostrates himself before his wife Mary and begs mercy for the eaten people. She refuses to have mercy. But he continues to plead and refuses to rise up from the ground. The baby Jesus Christ, only a few days old, then blesses Joseph’s pleas. So Mary decides to have mercy. She prays as usual in ""Hebrew"" (in tongues) and the people [who had been turned into dogs] are turned back into human beings: 900 men, 900 women, and 65 old people. These restored people come to the Holy Family completely naked, so Mary tells Joseph to give them clothes. She then asks them how they are and they reply that they are hungry, thirsty, anxious, and naked. She gives them a warning to treat their animals better in future. This happened after the circumcision of Jesus [and before the flight into Egypt]. Literal Translation of the story: After two months Joseph prostrated before our Lady Mary and said to her “I ask from you one thing.” Our Lady Mary knew his plan. She said to him “Don’t ask me about those evil ones. If any other, speak whatever you wish.” Joseph said to her “I have nothing to ask you about them, my Lady. They deserve that chastisement for you know the weakness of humanity.” “Mary said to him “I truly say to you, o my father Joseph, you can’t do this affair.” Joseph besought her in slow solicitude.” She raised him up from the ground. He refused to rise. He said to her “I truly say to you that I am not rising up until you show mercy (to the people) for my sake.” The child lifted up his hand and blessed over Joseph. Our Lady Mary knew that he (the child) wished them to be shown mercy. She raised Joseph from the ground and put the child on the ground. She stood up, stretched out her hands to heaven and said “Listen to me my child, who has become human from me by your will, my son, Hiruzieyanos, Mä’atyanos, Dərsmon, Liṭosr, Hermsäyom, Gəbtäram, Aqra’əbas, Amnay, Adonay, Ammanuel, I wish that you hold back from them the nature of an animal and return to them the nature of human beings.” At that time, the earth shook. Demons who were dwelling on their (the people’s) likeness took flight. They (the people) become filled with full consciousness and wisdom. They become like human beings of body and soul as before without lacking anything. Males according to the nature of males. Females according to the nature of females. There was none among them who had perished. All of them came naked as they were born. They stood before our Lady Mary and prostrated. Our Lady Mary said to Joseph “Take, I have shown them mercy for your sake. Cloth them with their clothes.” He did for each one as she commanded him. Mary said to the people “How did you live ? Tell me.” They said to her “In difficult hunger and thirst, naked, shouting day and night.” Our Lady Mary said to them “Why do you hate the stranger? Why do you pervert justice? Why do you condemn the orphan? For it is through these that God is conquered.” The people said to her “We did not understand. No one taught us.” The number of the people was 9000 men, 900 women, 65 old people.  Our Lady Mary said to them “Go. Enter in peace to your dwelling. Do not sin again that worse doesn’t happen to you. Go to your houses.” Our Lady Mary stayed (there) for about 10 days. After this, the people of the town came to her. She healed all of them. The blind saw. The dumb spoke. The deaf heard.The lame run. The demons were expelled. The lepers became clean. This happened after the circumcision of our Lord Jesus Christ. How much power and how many miracles have happened in the town and on the road. Had each one been written, it would have been impossible for the world to carry the book which is written. That you might know, understand, and be saved. Blessed is the one who heard its words for he will become like a Lebanon cedar that reaches to the sea and to the rivers. The heat of the sun does not make it dry. The southern wind does not make it wither. May her prayer and blessing be upon her slave Gäbrä Maryam unto the ages and ages. Amen.

Herod ordered his executioner Drsaiel to kill him. The informant descends into hades into the hands of the angels of darkness as his head departed from him. Then, Herod calls everyone in the town and massacres all 650 people, 60,097 animals, 63 dogs, 900,000 roosters. They all become martyrs with the saints. The soldiers of Herod saw the angels coming down with crowns and so they believed in Jesus and Mary. They told Herod to see how the Lord gives glory to His servants. Herod becomes angry and kills them all. He ordered the corpses to be gathered and burnt. Michael and Gabriel came down and smite the servants of Herod as they were executing Herod's command to burn the corpses. The saints then came and took the bodies of the martyrs and the animals to the land of Lebabon where Mary was. They also put the angel Raguiel with his army to guard them.

They invite the holy family onto their boats, to take them to the prince who rules over the island for he loves the popel of Jerusalem, his lineage is of the line of Israel and Galliee. The people introduce them to the prince and he received them very well and gave them a place to live. Where do you come from, the prince asked? From Jerusalem they said. Are you the ones who fled from Herod, the prince asks, and Mary became terrified and feel down like the dead at hearing the name, fearing the prince was friends with the man who wanted to harm her son. The prince fell down before her and told her, please do not be afraid, for an angel that this very night, that you were exiled from Herod's land and you will come here. Because I was praying for the healing of my son, the prince's son, and an angel told me, he was praying with the Psalms of David, I reached the place, lift up your power and come save us (Psalm 74?). A bright person came to me, holding a golden sceptor, and on the two sides of that person were two wings, like that of a white dove, he says, ""peace to you, you the chosen man, the Israelite, the wisdom and power of God, the savior has come to you as an infant, carried on the back of the daughter of David the king so that he might save the tribe of Israel and your son who is sick. The free land of Ethiopia will be sanctified by the walking of his mother's feet."" [very beautiful] ""She has fled from Herod, he is looking for her, his zeal for his ebbing kingdom, looking morning and evening, without break."" So the prince said, ""I fell down into the lake because of his terrifying voice but he left me up by his wings and stood me up. and he angel said, ""don't be afraid, I am Gabriel to tell you about this baby and make him live with you, will his return to the city of Jerusalem. Your son will be healed."" And prince says, ""angels of light came and encircled Lake Tana with swords of fire, and the demons fled and lightening followed them. and they made the demons go into the depths of that sea and descended into hell. Immediately, my son was healed of his illness and I saw a great grace of the god by his sending of his son. This is the God of my fathers Abraham ..., who had mercy on my son.""

When she prayed on 16 of Yakit, afer the ascension of our Lord, and Jesus gives Mary to John at the cross, and she has not stopped praying and going to the tomb of her son, when the Jews saw her they were very jealous of her. So they appointed guards to the tomb to prevent her from going there ot pray. But she doesn't stop going and the guards don't see her, for Jesus has covered her in the curtain of his glory and the angels would come and serve her and every day he would come and visit her. One day, on the 16 Yakit, the angels took her o the heavens resting place of righteous, all the souls of the patirarch, all the way from Adam to that time and they bowed down to her. ""You were created for us, flesh from our flesh, bone from our bone, [like what Adam says of Eve] in you we have found a balm, a salvation, you have become for us a harbor of life, because of the incarnation of the son of God in you.""

1119,(New) The famine in Egypt caused by the shortage of water in the Nile during the reign of Patriarch Matthew I (1378-1408).,Africa Ethiopia confirmed,"Concerning Dawit, King of Ethiopia. 1. Miracle of Our Lady Mary, the holy twofold Virgin, bearer of God. May her prayer and her blessing be with us in eternity - Amen. 2. And in those days, the Muslims in the land of Egypt were numerous and the distress against the Christians became severe, particularly those [Christians] from Constantinople and in Jerusalem and from Syria. 3. And when the people of the Franks saw this oppression, being assembled jointly they decided and advised unanimously and wrote a letter with a message and sent to the good and righteous King of Ethiopia, Dawit. 4. And they said: O King, beloved of the Virgin Mary and beloved of her son Jesus Christ, come quickly for our salvation from the conflict, because the Muslim people rose against us and subverted us not to invoke the name of Jesus Christ and not to pay homage to the Cross on which the Redeemer of the world was crucified and [not to invoke the name] of His mother, the holy Virgin Mary 5. And may this letter with a message gain benevolence in front of you and in front of all your brothers of the people of Ethiopia, that you will hasten coming to us and that you will help us and liberate us from the hand of our wicked enemies. 6. Because you know that we are associated with and companions of the people of Ethiopia for the sake of the love of Our Lady Mary, the twofold Virgin, bearer of God. 7. And when Dawit, King of Ethiopia heard this, he was sad and deeply distressed and the spiritual ardour filled him and at the time of the evening prayer he went into one church of Our Lady Mary, the bearer of God, which was nearby his royal palace (lit.: palace of his kingship). 8. And then he prostrated himself on his knees in front of the image of Our Lady Mary, the holy twofold Virgin, bearer of God, and he took refuge with her and said: And so, what shall I do on behalf of these Christians, believers in you, because they have sent to me because the Muslims distressed them? 9. And furthermore he prayed and said: O my Lady, mother of the Creator, glorification of the Christians, grace of kings and crown of the martyrs, pray to your son that He will give me power to go into the land of Egypt and make war against the Muslims on behalf of the flock of sheep of your beloved son, and give me, your servant, power and victory. 10. And after he had prayed thus and something like this (lit.: what is similar) he returned and entered the royal palace (see above no. 7). 11. And on this day at midnight Our Lady Mary, the holy twofold Virgin, bearer of God, appeared to the King of Ethiopia Dawit and she said to him: 0 my beloved and beloved of my son Jesus Christ, and now 1 have asked my son on behalf of you that you will go and rescue my nation, the Christians, and thus He has granted and made even for you your way. Get up and go. And He will perform through your hand many miracles. 12. And when Dawit, King of Ethiopia, woke up from his sleep, he was very pleased about what she had told to him, and the power of God filled him. And when it became daybreak he sent around a herald and he assembled  all his warriors of his army from all the provinces of Ethiopia and he went to make war against the Muslims of Egypt and he arrived in Sənnar. 13. And God gave him wisdom and he stopped  the river Gəyon (sec above p. 55f.), so that it did not descend into the land of Egypt, because there are no rains in the land of the people of Egypt; unless the water of the Gəyon, which flows from Ethiopia, reaches them, they do not plough, they do not sow seed and they do not get water at all. 14. And afterwards Dawit, King of Ethiopia, sent to those who were in Jerusalem and the Franks, saying: O my beloved, the king with his soldiers has reached you and I stopped the river Gəyon, so that it does not descend to the land of Egypt. Was it not said once: To restrain the water is like beginning a war, but the will of God, the Lord of the Christians, may come about. 15. And when the faithful who lived in Jerusalem and the Franks heard this, they were pleased with great joy and said: God will help and give power and victory to the orthodox King of Ethiopia, Dawit, and He may straighten all his paths for him who rescues us from the hand of our enemies and there they observe the rule. 16. Then the Muslims of Egypt realised the coming of the King of Ethiopia, Dawit, in great majesty by the will of God and with the assistance of Our Lady Mary and he approached with many of his soldiers, who were countless, while riders on horses and camels followed, and he arrived suddenly in Sənnar. Immediately they came together and devised on behalf of them a plan which would be better and appropriate. 17. And then they sent a message to the faithful of Jerusalem saying: Thus from now on we will not fight against you  again to touch your order and we have no war with you and we do not disdain your faith which exists since ancient times with your fathers, but we appeal to you for protection that the King of Ethiopia may go back to his country. 18. And because of this the faithful of Jerusalem and the Franks praised God with great glory because He made visible his guarantee for Dawit, and in presence of the nations He revealed His Covenant. 19. And they praised Our Lady, the holy twofold Virgin, bearer of God, saying: Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb   because you became for us the harbour of life from desolation. 20. And then the faithful of Jerusalem and the people of the Franks sent a message to Dawit, King of [Ethiopia], and the message of this was: The trumpet for our salvation raised up for us from the house of Dawit His servant, that he will save us from the hand of our enemy and from the hand of all who arc hating  us, because He remembered the ho! y covenant of His oath which He swore to Abraham, our father. He will save us so that we worship Him in justice and righteousness and you Dawit, King of Ethiopia, will be called the Orthodox. 21. And now we beg you and beseech you that you may abandon the attack and the warfare with the Muslims, because they have abandoned their evil things. And return back for them the water of the Gəyon as [it was] before and return into your country in peace. 22. And when Dawit, King of Ethiopia, read this message, he was glad and happy and said: Blessed be God, Lord of Israel, who alone has performed great and wonder. 23. And blessed be the Virgin, perfect in all thinking by her prayer and her petition. 24. And afterwards he entered his country in peace. 25. And the faithful of Jerusalem and the Franks were able to live in peace. 26. Her prayer and her blessing be with us in eternity -Amen. Veronika Six. 1999. Water — The Nile — And the Täʾamrä Maryam.

Summary: The Christians whom the Muslims are threatening ask Emperor Dawit for help. After reading their letter he goes into a church dedicated to the Virgin Mary, and there he takes refuge with her. During night-time the Virgin appears and gives him the advice to fight against the Muslims, also saying that God has given him wisdom to divert the Nile. So he leaves his country, accompanied by many soldiers and meets the Muslims in Sennar. The Muslims, being scared because they cannot harvest without water from the Nile, send a letter to the Christians, declaring that they no longer will be their enemies and therefore they would request Dawit to return the water. When Dawit hears the news about the peaceful co-operation between Muslims and Christians, he praises the Virgin and returns into his country according to their petition. Veronika Six. 1999.

And he saw a great miracle (which) had great powers and revelations and a moisture (ወሐፍ - from ሀፈወ) was coming down do the earth. And they said to him, it is not right for this oil to spill on to the earth.  However, the icon (አይቁና) departed to the region.  And it was hidden and others would be anointed from this blessing and all who desired would be healed.  And there was a Abbot who followed the advice of the Bishop. And after this he constructed a place for her and he put a window for it and decorated it with white stones (ርኳም) and in the middle of the window he placed a garment. And at this time there was a clergy member whose name was Mark in a near by city. And they performed liturgy per their custom and received from the mystery (i.e eucharist). And the priest, who remembers (or the protector) of the Icon carried it (i.e. the icon?) and they circled the church along with the Abbot.  And as this was happening, there was a great earthquake until Abbot desired (or perhaps was caused to) fall upon another. And they heard in the midst of the ravage, inside the church a great uproar (or earthquake) and they were greatly scared and they thought that the heavens (i.e. the sky) fell upon the earth and the priest was unable move his hands nor speak and he was this way for three days.  And after this he died.  And they heard a word from the Icon on this day which said do not leave (behind) one person who was within this region nor among those who were coming towards it and stated that no one among the lay men?? (i.e. ሕዛብውያን) assist (i.e. with the icon).When they heard this they were greatly amazed and ordered no one to assist (with the icon) other than a virgin monk.  And after this all those who came to this region were healed.  But those who touched the oil without faith received what they were deserving of.  Then merchants came and saw the icon and wanted to honor the icon and desired to ask the Virgin Mary to make them worthy to enter the kingdom of heaven.

1136,(New) Saint Mary of Guadalupe performs a miracle for a prisoner and the guard converts. (similar to ID 423),Europe confirmed (Spain),"This is a miracle that happened during the time of Hispania and in a church named Saint Mary of Guadalupe, who performed many miracles for prisoners who were imprisoned by heathens. She would free them from prison and place them within the church. And there was a certain bell within it that made a sound without any hand or person being present to hit the bell. And there was a certain prisoner who was waiting on the assistance of the Virgin. And he always prayed for her intercession. However, a guardian of the prison saw him and made fun of him and questioned how his prayer was going to save him. But the prisoner continued to pray. Seeing that the prisoner was not giving up hope in his faith, the guard put him in a chest [box? Cage?] with a dog who was as big as a lion. That night, as the prisoner was sleeping, the Virgin Mary took the chest to the church and took the dog to the guard. And, at the cock’s crow, the bell was rung without anyone’s hand. And the monks woke up knowing there was a miracle that was performed. When they went into the church, they found the chest and the guard next to it, chained up with the dog. The monks questioned the guard, and he responded by saying he was a man with no good deeds and he came from a far away land. After admitting his wrong doing, he begged them to open the chest, telling them that they would find a Christian who could testify about everything. When they opened the chest, they found the prisoner, who told them about about everything that happened. They all rejoiced and the guard believed in Christ Jesus and His Mother. And he lived the remaining of his life praising God. [Notes: Several Mediterranean miracle collections introduce stories at various points in the medieval period about rescuing the faithful from slavery. Including people from Africa. the earliest ms collection of Our Lady of G is late medieval/early renaissance (late 15th? early 16th?) But includes material from various periods.]",,,,,"Jeremy: In ID 423 it is a king who is transported into the church and he is convinced of his wrongdoing and is baptized and becomes the protector of the Church of Mary. As opposed to a similar thing happening to a guard in ID 1136.

How a beam of light shines on two churches of Ethiopia during Mahliet. [there is this following translation by Allie of Colin item 154, Chapter four in Google Docs]  In the country of Ethiopia, there are two churches, one in Gola-Mâqedâ named [se nomme] House of Matâ, and the other that they call Gogdâ-Wagdâ - at the site of the tomb of the blessed monk Mâmâs. On the day of the commemoration of these just individuals, when the people chant and make the song resound, assembled there, there appears a splendor of light which traverses the wall and the roof of the church, be it day or night. When the Eucharistic service is complete, the light climbs up high. So it is that you heard/understood the glory of the song. Let us deem blessed Our Lady Mary so that she might wake us to praise her. As for those who mock those who sing songs during the feasts of Our Lady Mary the Virgin, during the feasts of God and during other known feasts, so it is that they are similar to Michal who despised David in her heart when she saw him dancing and playing music before the Ark. She said to him, “How the king of Israel was glorious today, he who uncovered himself under the eyes of the wives of his servants, as one of those who dances uncovers himself!” David said to Michal, “It is before God that I danced; may God be blessed, He who saved me by/from the hand of His father. “I will frolic again and I will dance before God, I will uncover myself again and I will be despised before your eyes.” And because of this, God gave no children to Michal because she had scorned David when she had seen him dancing before God. As for those who praise/glorify God by the song, crying with their whole strength, they are associated with the glorification of the seraphs that Isaac heard while they cried and said: “Holy, holy, holy is the God of armies, His glory completely fills the whole earth”, to the point where the threshold of the door lifted at the voice of those who cried.

1160,"(New) Cyriaque (Heryaqos) of Behnesa, Egypt, ecstatically authors the Anaphora of Our Lady Mary",Africa Ethiopia confirmed,"[Also COM] [is this ID 631, also about Cyriaque???] How Heryaqos of Behensa authored the Anaphora of Mary. (Related to the Preface of the Commentary of Qdasie Mariam) [there is this following translation by Allie of Colin item 160 in Google Docs]  There was a bishop named Cyriaque who resided in the city of Behnesâ. He loved Our Lady, the holy twice-virgin Mary, Mother of God, with all his heart and all his mind. This just and virtuous bishop was distressed and grew sad because he did not have a lot of instruction. He continually nourished the good desire (to be) like Éphrem the Syrian who composed the praises of Our Lady. He would say, “If, for me, the praises of Our Lady Mary multiplied like the sand of the sea and the star of the sky, I would wrap myself in them like a coat and I would savor them like food.” The monks of the monastery insulted him, mocked him, scorned him and laughed at him, because he did not have a lot of instruction. He tolerated them. One day among days, on the day of the feast of Our Lady, that is to say the first of genbot, the priests and the monks said to him, testing him, “Celebrate the mass for us and unite? [communie] the people with the holy mystery.” Abbâ Cyriaque responded and said to them, “How would it be possible for me to celebrate the mass among all this assembly, when I do not have a lot of instruction? Above all, the feast of this day is great. With all these reasons, how would this be possible for me?” They said to him again, “If you refuse, we will speak to the patriarch; he will reveal your act to the people and will bring upon you another stain because of your refusal regarding the altar. You will be covered in shame before all the people assembled here and in all places. (The patriarch?) will accuse you with the people and you will be dismissed from your duty.” So he said to them, “Yes, wait for me a bit.” And abbâ Cyriaque distanced himself a bit from them and said in secret, “O my Lady, holy twice-virgin Mary, Mother of God, see the sinful work of these monks; informed of my weakness, they made themselves blind to me and seized me in their assembly of sin.” As for the monks, it seemed to them that he had said “wait for me” to purify his body. “O my Lady,” (he continued), “take care of what I need, like a mother watches over her children. Open the door of my intelligence and may the light of your grace shine within. O my Lady, toward you my eyes rise, like the eye of the servant-girl toward the hand of her mistress.” He said this in prayer and all (speech) that is similar to it. When he had completed his prayer, he returned beside the monks and assumed the sacerdotal role. He prepared to celebrate the mass, to serve the mystery, and to offer the Eucharist from his holy hands. The monks aided him, as was their custom. He said, “Blessed be God the Father, the master of the whole universe, amen. Blessed be God the only Son, the Lord Jesus Christ who is born of Mary, of the holy Virgin, for our health, amen. Blessed be God the Holy Spirit, the Paraclete, who gives strength and purity to all of us, amen.” After this, they read the epistles of Paul the apostle and the Acts of the Apostles. After this, Abbâ Cyriaque read in the Gospel of John what is written concerning the bread of life which descended from the heavens - it is the body and the blood of Christ. When he got to the offertory (?), they took out/pulled for him one of the anaphoras of the fathers, according to what they had decided against him, for he knew no other anaphora than that of the apostles. In that moment, he looked upward and said in his mind, “O mother of the light, may the moment have arrived when you come to the aid of your servant.” When he was saying this, a leaf/sheet of light stretched upon the altar like a veil. There were written the words “my heart trembled [vibré]”. They appeared only to him, sprouted in his heart, and disappeared. At the same moment, the Holy Spirit made him think thus, “This day is neither the feast of the angels nor the feast of the just and the martyrs, but the feast of the holy virgin Mary, Mother of God.” Abbâ Cyriaque was submerged in the swell of the mystery which surrounded him from all sides. The mind/spirit of wisdom and of knowledge was given to him to the point where he spoke according to what is true and explained the mystery of the Trinity, for the light of the grace of God had filled his heart and the mind/spirit of wisdom and of knowledge had resided upon him by the intercession of Our Lady Mary, Mother of God. He began to draw from the mystery of the divinity of the Trinity like from a well of water. This is why he said, “I tremble according to when the Holy Spirit makes me tremble.” He began to say loudly, “My heart trembled with beautiful words, my heart trembled with beautiful words, my heart trembled with beautiful words; I know the liturgy of Mary,” until the end of this written work where it is said, “Now let us praise the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, now, always, and for ever and ever, amen.” At that moment, the monks and the priests who had plotted a cruel plan against him were flustered. The crowd of those who were assembled outside and inside were filled with wonder and astounded; they said, “Blessed be God who made us hear these words of the liturgy of Mary! Blessed by our Lady to all who showed us the power of her miracle upon this just and humble man, abbâ Cyriaque!” See, my dear brothers, this admirable and astounding act that God did for abbâ Cyriaque by the intercession and the supplication of Our Lady, the holy twice-virgin Mary, Mother of God.

1209,(New) A pious woman named Sâmiyâ Yosêf of Port Said in Egypt is healed of a terrible illness of the heart in 1982 [EC?],,"[Also COM] Colin item 204: In the year 1982 after the birth of Our Lord Jesus Christ, a great miracle was done in the land of Egypt by the hands of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, Mother of God, the doer of miracles and wonders. There was a woman in the country of Egypt who lived on the island of Port-Saïd. The name of this woman was Sâmiyâ Yosêf and the name of her husband, Rouêq Hannâ. Both feared God and loved Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, Mother of God. Above all, this woman always went early in the morning to the church of Our Lady Mary. So she begged and supplicated, she devoted herself completely to prayer, day and night. She never distanced herself from the walls/interior [enceinte] of the church, neither in morning nor in evening. She visited the poor and needy and served them in all things; she helped the widows and the orphans. As she was acting so, in such a fine way, she contracted a heart illness. Each day, her illness worsened. After many days, her illness turned into a great illness ebat [left italicized in Colin]. It went out of the interior of her heart [and moved] towards her left breast. Then it gained her hands (?). She went to the doctors and all the practitioners of the country. They began to treat her for her severe heart illness, but they could not cure her. As for her, she spent all her money and did not know what to do. When she knew with certainty that no one among men would save her from her illness, she pondered and pronounced in her heart a determined word, saying, “Now I have no other idea than to turn to prayer again and to the intercession of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, Mother of God, intercessor of mercy and of life.” After having said this, she went to the church of Our Lady Mary, entered the interior, and bowed before the icon of Our Lady without resting, shedding tears from the third hour of the morning until the eleventh hour of the day. Then she returned to her house. When she had come back to her house, she did not taste any food because of the greatness of her weakness, but she went to the place where she slept and, there, fell asleep on her bed. That day, during the middle of the night, while the woman called Sâmiyâ was in her slumber, Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, Mother of God, came beside her, with the archangel Michael following her. There were five virgins with her, a young adolescent, and a widowed woman, all of whom were dressed in white clothing. Then Our Lady touched the breasts and the chest of the woman. Immediately the door of her heart opened like the door of a room (?). Our Lady took out a tumor (?) that was hard as stone from deep within her heart; she wrapped it in cloth and set it down for the woman on the table that was beside her bed. Then she blessed her (Sâmiyâ) and climbed to heaven with the others. A nice odor spread there and so the woman got better. When the woman called Sâmiyâ woke from her slumber, she said, “What is this whose perfume is so good that it transports hearts?” So she saw what had been taken out of her heart, wrapped in cloth and set down on the table. She cried loudly and called the people of her house. They came, hurrying, for it had seemed to them that she wailed at death, because of the force/volume of her clamor; but, when they were near her, she said to them, “Come, see this wondrous and astonishing act that was done upon me by Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, Mother of God.” When they saw this piece of flesh that was hard as stone, taken out of the heart of the woman and wrapped in cloth, how also the woman was cured of the heart illness that tormented her, they marveled at the medical treatment of the goodness of Our Lady Mary. The day after this day, at the third hour, archbishops and bishops, priests and deacons and all the people of the town came beside the woman, for they had learned of the miracle that Our Lady did upon this woman. The woman informed them how Our Lady had saved her and healed her, from beginning to end, and showed them the heavy tumor (?), which was hard as stone, which had been taken out of her heart.When they saw this miracle and wonder, they marveled and were astonished. They praised God the Most High and praised Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, Mother of God, who asks mercy for the children of men and gives life to all the human race. The account of this miracle spread in all the corners of the world and, because of this, this miracle was put in writing and joined to the Book of Miracles of Our Lady Mary, Mother of God, the doer of miracles and wonders.

Translated by Allie Mangel from Colin 119: There was a king in a town. The father and mother of this king loved Our Lady, the holy twice-virgin Mary, Mother of God, of tender heart, quick to aid, consoler of the afflicted and help of the tried. This king had doctors that he had established in his palace. At the time of the meal, they lay on a great bed and ate with him. When the king contracted a painful illness called dropsy, the king (therefore) asked them to cure him of this painful illness. They knew that they could not cure him. When they had been incapable of curing him, so they said to the king, “O king, seek a young boy who is the only son of his father and his mother; then order that his mother hold him and his father slit his throat.

Her apparition took place from the first hour of the night on that day for seven days without interruption. She, Our Lady, soon showed herself in all her person, soon appeared from the waist up, clothed in light. When the apparition of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, Mother of God, was learned of in all the land of Egypt, a numberless crowd of those who had faith assembled rapidly, each from all the countries of the world, by planes and by boats. The journalists also came together to write the account of the miracle of Mary. The people came here? [celle-ci], turning here and there atop the cupula of the church. She looked at them, greeted them with her head, and blessed them with a cross of light that she held in her hand. They bowed upon their faces. At that moment, she appeared standing in all her height/size, attired in a luminous cloud [nuée], clothed in light and circulating in the air. Sometimes she was lifted upwards and flew above the air. After all this affair, Our Lady blessed all the people who were assembled there and showed them a great glory. Those who were assembled there, patriarchs, bishops, chiefs of state, prominent persons, and all those who had come from the four corners of the earth, praised God who had allowed them the honor of seeing the aspect of the face and the person of Mary.

1220,(New) Thieves steal a church's Tabot of Mary and put it in a nearby mosque and the crescent on the minaret changes into a cross of light,Africa Ethiopia confirmed,"[Also COM, Rowan] Colin 207 How thieves stole the Tabot of Mary from a church and put it in a near by mosque. The crescent on the minaret changed into a cross of light. The muslims, unable to take down the cross and failing to understand what is going on, consult the Christians. The Christians come and take the Tabot with them. Colin item 207: There was a church of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, Mother of God, in the land of Ethiopia. On the grounds of this church there, there was a Muslim sanctuary. One day, thieves entered the church of Our Lady and stole the altar of Mary. They gave it to the Muslims, being associated with them, so that they (Muslims) might sell it in another country. The Muslims put the altar in their sanctuary that was there and placed it in the interior. At this moment, a miracle appeared on the roof of the Muslim sanctuary: the sign of their santurary, which is the sign of the crescent moon, was changed into the sign of the cross. This sign of the cross shone like the sun. So there was an agitation among the Muslims, for they did not know what had happened in their sanctuary, apart from the few Muslims who were associated with the thieves and had all done this bad action. To clarify this affair, the Muslims stood, brought a ladder, and went out upon the sanctuary to take down this sign of the cross from the roof of their sanctuary. When they approached the sign of the cross, this sign was changed into the sign of the crescent. So they left it and descended to the earth, marveling. They said, “What happened on this day in this place?” Again, after they had descended to the earth, the sign of the crescent was changed into the sign of the cross. They hurried out again to take it down, but they found the sign resembling the sign of the crescent. They left it again and descended to the earth. The sign of the cross appeared three times upon the sanctuary. At this moment, anger and fury came upon the Muslims and they didn’t know what to do. So they said, “Come, let’s enter the sanctuary; let’s search and see if there is a reason for this sign of the cross.” When the Muslims had entered the sanctuary, a light resembling the sign of the cross shone there where the altar of Mary was, just as the sign had appeared previously on the roof of the sanctuary. But they could not approach the altar, for the sparling of the light was too strong for them. So fear and trembling seized them. They went rapidly to the church of Our Lady, which was on the other side of the Muslim sanctuary. They called the priests and said to them, “Come see what happened at our [sanctuary]; we were greatly tormented when a light resembling the sign of the cross shined in our sanctuary and on its roof. When we wanted to find out what happened, it was impossible for us to approach because of the sparkling of the light.” When the priests and deacons heard this speech, they came hurrying to the Muslim sanctuary. They arrived there and the Muslims permitted them to enter the interior and to do as they wished. Then they saw the light resembling the shining cross; it guided them there where the altar was and made them arrive beside it. So they found the altar and said, “We found the altar enveloped in clothes of white linen which the thieves stole from us three days ago.” So the priests and deacons said to the Muslims, “What have we done, such that you would commit against us such an evil action?” The Muslims responded to the priests and deacons and said to them, “As for the affair of which you speak to us, we swear to you, by our faith, that we know nothing of it; if we had done this evil action against you, we would not have called you so that you might come here, and we would not have permitted you to enter our sanctuary, nor to do as you wished. Now take your altar.” After this, the priests and the deacons picked up the altar, took it, and brought it into its place with great honor. So numerous people began to surround it, Christians and Muslims, elderly and children, men and women, singing, crying and saying, “In the trees of the fields, we found our mother Sion, we took her; let us say to her: welcome!” At the same moment, there was, as before, a sign resembling the crescent upon the roof of the Muslim sanctuary; it was firm upon its base. The bishop who was in this town consecrated and honored the altar of Mary and the church. To the people also, he gave benediction and sent them away in peace. (translation by Allie V.

1221,(New) Guchen Maryam tabot cycle: Thieves steal the tabot from this church and try to sell it but Muslims see that the thieves are spiritually on fire [spelling],Africa Ethiopia confirmed,"[Also COM] Colin item 208: There was a church in the land of Ethiopia that was constructed in the name of Our Lady; it was called Guechên Mâryâm (Dabra Karbê). The walls (?) of this church were constructed on a tall mountain at the place where there rested a fragment of the cross of Jesus Christ that David, the king of Ethiopia, had brought from Jerusalem. Because of this, this monastery was, in honor, the second after Axoum Sion. One day among days, in the middle of the night, thieves came to this church of our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, Mother of God. When they had arrived, they broke its doors, entered, entered the interior and stole the altar of Our Lady Mary; they were in agreement to sell this altar of the law of God to Muslims for 80 million (!) [Colin’s mark] pieces of silver. After this, they picked up the altar, placed it in a chest, sealed [the chest], and loaded it onto a camel. They went and arrived at the maritime port of Assab, for they had arranged a meeting there with the Muslims. The Muslims came on a boat from a faraway place. They arrived at the maritime port, touched earth, and went there where they had arranged a meeting with the thieves; a guide led them. But when the Muslims saw from afar the light burning upon the shoulders of the thieves who had taken the altar, the Muslims (thus) cried and said, “What do we see upon the shoulders of these men; this which takes away eyes/sight [emporte les yeux]?” When the thieves arrived beside the Muslims, carrying the chest in which was the shelf/slab [tablette] that they had stolen, they [Muslims] cried and said, “You men, do not come here and do not approach us, for a fire comes out and blazes from the chest that you carried! The intensity of the heat [ardeur de la chaleur] of this fire burns us even though we are still far from the place where it is. Return it or throw away what you brought!” The thieves did not see the fire blazing upon their shoulders and did not notice anything; and what is more, they came running toward the Muslims, for it seemed to them that they [Muslims] had said to them, “Come quickly beside us.” The Muslims turned their backs and fled, shouting. At this moment, when the soldiers of the town’s garrison saw the Muslims, they took them and demanded from them what they had [feels like the word “seen” should follow here, but isn’t in Colin?]. The Muslims said to the soldiers, “See, then, how it blazes and takes away sight, this flame of light that is upon the shoulders of the people who come toward us. The intensity of the heat of this light burned us even though it was still far from us. Because of this, we are afraid that it will kill us and [so] we fled. Indeed, we are strangers to this town and we came from afar, from the other side of the sea.” When the soldiers heard this speech, they turned their faces to the right and caught sight of this flame of light that shone upon the thieves. They [soldiers] seized them [thieves] and said to them, “What did you bring; a light shines upon you and takes away sight? What land do you come from?” And they questioned them rudely. The thieves said, “Here, we came from the town of Guechên and, as for what we brought, it is this chest in which is the altar of Mary of the town of Guechên. We came here to sell it to these people for 80 million pieces of silver. But we know nothing of what there is upon us, like you say: ‘A light shines upon you.’” The soldiers (marveled) at this miracle that was done by Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, Mother of God. Those who were assembled there praised God who had revealed a great sign upon the altar of His mother the Virgin and they praised Our Lady Mary, the doer of miracles and wonders. After this, the soldiers sent the altar by the hand of priests to the head of the archbishops and patriarch of Ethiopia, Abbâ Paul. It was blessed by the hand of the head of the archbishops and the priests brought it into the sanctuary of Our Lady Mary, who is called the Saint of saints; it is the seat of the patriarch. They left it there with honor until it returned to the town of Guechên (Dabra Karbê). (translation by Allie V.

1222,(New) Guchen Maryam tabot cycle: Mary appears in the patriarch's Addis Ababa church and demands to know why her tabot has not been returned to Guechên Mâryâm [unclear],Africa Ethiopia confirmed,"[Also COM] Colin item 209: How Our Lady appeared in the church of Mary the Saint of saints: (Where) it is said how Our Lady made a miracle in the monastery of Mary the Saint of saints, which was the base [siege] of the patriarch of Ethiopia. In those days, the altar of Mary of Dabra Karbê (Guechên) was together with the altar of Mary the Saint of saints, which was the base of the patriarch of Ethiopia – (that was) for seven months, after it had been found in the hands of thieves. While this altar was so in the monastery of Mary the Saint of saints, one day, Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary mother of God, appeared in the open to the people in the interior of the cupola of the church. She stood upon the wall of the windows of the church, without moving or speaking, her face was shining like the sun. The people assembled, men and women, old and young, from the vicinity of Addis-Abeba, to see the beauty of the face of Our Lady. The enclosure of the church was packed, because of the number of people. The royal soldiers came to make people leave the enclosure of the church, by striking them with violence and scaring them with arms. But the assembled people then refused to leave and were stronger than the soldiers. All the people thus did not go back to their homes, on the contrary, they stayed there without eating or drinking. They prayed with an assured heart, day and night, until there appeared the power of the miracle of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary mother of God. And then, a great light rose, and this light filled the church. There came a speaking voice from the icon of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary mother of God; it said, “Why are you slow to bring me back  to the city of Guechên (Dabra Karbê), and why have you not reinstalled me in my base [siège] of Dabra Karbê, after having found me and liberated [racheté] me from the hands of thieves, by the power of my Son Jesus Christ? Now, bring me quickly to my cell.” Immediately, there was a great joy with many exclamations of jubilation from all the people who were assembled there. Their clamor filled the totality of the enclosure of the church. Having learned of this miracle, the head of archbishops and patriarch abbâ Paul came the next day, with many archbishops. He ordered the assembly of the notables of the city and the heads of the monastery, the priests and the deacons and all the Christians who were within the limits of the Addis-Abeba region. When the order of the head of archbishops and patriarch abba Paul was circulated to all the churches of the Addis-Abeba region, then, the notables of the city and all the Christians assembled. The priests and cantors came with clothing embroidered with gold and silver, carrying a pedestal of silver and little bells of gold and silver. The monks, the priests and the deacons came, surrounded by crowns/halos [couronnes] of gold and silver; they were carrying crosses of gold and silver and censers of gold and silver. There, they all assembled in the courtyard of the church of the Saint of saints Mary, which was called the base [siège] of the patriarch of Ethiopia. There they stayed throughout the night, singing hymns, psalms, and the book [livre] of/for the hours of the night. The next day, in the hour of morning, they consecrated the altar of Mary of Dabra Guechên and celebrated a festival for her, in great honors. Many people assembled and took leave of the altar (which was going) into its country with honor and with great joy. After that, the head of archbishops and patriarch of Ethiopia abbâ Paul, other archbishops and bishops and many people of the Addis-Abeba area, with the notables of the city, went with the altar. The heads of Guechên and the people of this city welcomed them with great honor and with great joy. They placed the altar of Mary of Dabra Guechên in its place. There was at that moment a great joy in all the cities of Ethiopia. Because of that, all the people blessed the head of archbishops and patriarch abbâ Paul, because he had exalted and honored the altar of Our Lady Mary, and he had brought it back to its home, with great honor and in upright faith. They glorified God creator of all, and returned grace to Our Lady, the maker of miracles and wonders.

When it was known around the world, the apparition of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, Mother of God, in the land of Egypt, an inumerable crowd of those who have faith assembled from all the corners of the universe, every man for himself, by car, by airs, or by boats. The journalists also came together to describe the beauty of the aspect of Our Lady and to write the story of the miracle of Mary the Virgin. When they saw Our Lady turning from one side to another atop the vault of the church, they fell upon their faces and bowed before the beauty of the aspect of the Virgin, who shone seven times more than the sun and whose hands were extended upon this great church. She raised the people who had fallen to the earth and said to them, “Pray and beg God, He who loves men, the merciful and mild, who accepts the fast and the prayer, who gives life and salvation [salut] so that men do not fall into temptation and escape the nets of Satan. In effect, He ordered (thus): ‘Here the axe is laid to the root of the trees.’” The people who were assembled there, necks bent, head bowed and hands outstretched, praised by saying, “Glory to God who made us reach this holy place and who made us see the beauty of His mother, the Holy Virgin, elect of God and praised by the mouth of every creature!” Our Lady blessed them, saying, “May the benediction of my beloved Son, of his Father and of the Holy Spirit stay upon you; may peace be with you all.” Then she climbed to the heavens in a great glory. Having been blessed, the people left to their countries, glorifying God and giving thanks to Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, Mother of God. They told the people, with a great voice, all that Our Lady had done in the land of Egypt. Because of this, this miracle was put in writing and added into the Book of Miracles of Our Lady, the Holy Twice-Virgin Mary, Mother of God. (translation by Allie V.

1224,"(New) Thieves, including a man named Salomon Zallaqa, steal valuables from the patriarch's Addis Ababa church but when they try to do it again an invisible being attacks them with whips",Africa Ethiopia confirmed,"[Also COM] Colin item 210: On that day, that is to say, the 29th of nahasē, thieves entered the church of the Saint of Saints Mary, which is the seat of the patriarchy of Ethiopia. Among the thieves, one called himself Salomon Zallaqa. After they had entered the church, they stole and plundered all the goods of the church and all the sacred vases. They took as much as they could carry, left, and immediately disappeared. After the thieves had left, a deacon went to the church and rang the bell so that the priests would assemble in the holy church for the tenth hour of prayer and for the morning prayer. Then he approached the door of the church to open it. So he found the doors open and broken. He was shaken and afraid. He did not enter the interior, but went to the abbot, who was named Amhâ Sellâsê, and told him all that had happened. At that moment, the abbot Amhâ Sellâsê quickly rose, went to the church, and entered. When he (wished to) inspect all the goods of the church and the holy vases, he did not find them; he found none. So he knew with certainty that thieves had entered and had stolen them. Immediately, the abbot quickly sent a message to assemble the priests and all the faithful who were on the grounds of the Saint of Saints Mary Church. After the priests, the faithful and all the people were assembled in the church named Saint of Saints Mary - which is the seat of the patriarchy of Ethiopia - , the abbot said to those who were assembled there, “This day, in the middle of the night, thieves entered this church and stole all the vases of the church. Because of this, we should make a prayer of supplication for seven days before the icon of Our Lady, the holy twice-virgin Mary, Mother of God, so that she might show the power of her miracle upon these thieves.” The priests and all the people agreed with this speech and said, “Yes, our father, we will do as you have ordered.” Then they made a prayer of supplication before the icon of Our Lady, the holy twice-virgin Mary, Mother of God. But before the prayer of supplication was finished and before the seven days had passed, the thieves came back to the church, as was their custom. They approached the door to open the iron bolt with something like (a key?). Immediately, they opened the door, moved aside the panels, and entered the interior. Then they began to plunder the vases of the church and found there a golden clock/pendulum [pendule] attached to the wall. They felt great joy and hastened to exit the church. At that moment, the door of the church closed itself for them and was secured as before. As for those thieves who were in the church, their eyes were blinded. They tired themselves searching for the door; it escaped them and they could not find it. When it was morning, the abbot came, and the priests and the faithful assembled to make the prayer of supplication. But previously, a deacon opened the door of the church and found the thieves. So he was afraid and cried loudly. At that moment, there arrived beside him one called Sabla Krestos, who was the guardian of the church. Then the priests and the faithful came running. They entered the church, found the thieves, seized them, and made them go outside. When the people questioned the thieves, they [the thieves] said, “This day, in the middle of the night, we came to steal the vases of the church that we would find, as is our custom. We opened the closed door of the church with something like a key. We entered the interior of the church, we found a clock attached to the wall, and we took it. When we wanted to exit the church, we found the door of the church locked; we did not find it as before and we tired ourselves greatly. Because of this, we also approached to break the panel of a window. At that moment, our eyes were blinded. What is more, when we wandered here and there to search for the exit, there was a hand that slapped our cheeks and there was a whip that lashed our backs, even though we did not know from whence it came. But when we stayed calm without moving, and when we did not say, “there, here!”, the slaps on our cheeks and the lashing on our backs quickly ceased.” They narrated all that had happened to them in the middle of a large assembly. So the abbot said to the thieves, “What, then, is more fitting for you than the blindness of your eyes? When you were adolescents, you became blind because of your bad actions.” The thieves replied to the abbot and said to him, “What shall we do? Only supplicate Our Lady, who did against us this miracle because of the greatness of our sin.” So the abbot brought the icon of Our Lady and said to the people, “Pray before the icon of the Holy Virgin and say, ‘Lord, have pity on us, Christ. For Our Lady Mary, have pity on us, Christ.’” They prayed and begged, according to what the abbot had ordered them. The thieves bowed before the icon of Our Lady. After the end of the prayer, the abbot made the (prayer of) consolation. When he said, “May God deliver us from the snares of our sins,” the eyes of the thieves opened and they saw the light as before. At that moment, there was great joy among the people and the priests who were assembled in the church, when they saw this miracle. They praised God the much praised and praised Our Lady, the holy twice-virgin Mary, Mother of God, the doer of miracles and of wonders. As for the thieves, they said, “So it is that from now on, we will live the rest of our days doing good by submitting ourselves to God and by serving Our Lady, the holy twice-virgin Mary, Mother of God.” (translation by Allie V.

When these thieves entered, they began to plunder all the vases of the church. They found there the crowns and the golden sandals that had been given to Zion Mary by Ménélik, the king of kings of Ethiopia, as well as other (objects): chalices, crosses, golden patens and censers, veils and precious clothings. All that they found, they plundered and took. Then they went to the west of the church and descended below, where there was the garden of Our Lady. The garden was lush; they entered the garden. Then they began to debate how to divide what they had stolen. While they debated thus, a painful thing suddenly happened to them: at that moment, they were deprived of their senses and dazed. Their heart[s] liquified like wax, their eyes grew blind, their ears grew deaf, their hands and their feet were tied and thus they could not move. That day, a widow who prepared the affairs of the altar came to the church early in the morning. When she approached to do the salutation, she saw the windows open and broken; she felt a great fear. So she quickly rose and rang the bell before the time of (ringing) the bell. Immediately, the priests and all the people assembled quickly at the church. The priests entered the church and saw that all the holy vases had been plundered. So all the people who were assembled there said, “Let’s speak to the governor of the town and follow the trail of these thieves.” The people went, hastening, to the four corners; so they arrived, running, at the garden. They found the thieves spreading their hands upon the holy vases, without moving, but they did not do evil to these thieves and did not think of killing them. On the contrary, they declared them blessed, for the power of the miracle of Mary had caught/restrained them. After this, they [the people] took them [the thieves] and steered them into the church. They held these thieves in the middle of the assembled people and said to them, “So, tell us all that you did to the interior of these walls and in the church.” The thieves narrated all that they had done from beginning to end. Above all, they were consoled when the tears came and they repented the evil that they had done by committing a transgression. Because of this, Our Lady had seized them, confining them by the power of her miracle. At that moment, all the people marveled greatly. Some wept because of this great and astounding miracle. After this whole affair, they praised God who had shown them this admirable thing and gave thanks to Our Lady, the glorious and most high, the doer of miracles and of wonders. Out of goodness, they allowed the thieves to go in peace to their house. (translation by Allie V.

1226,(New)  A woman named Âlam Tsahay in Addis Ababa suffered from terrible stomach pain and Mary heals her while the infant Jesus,Africa Ethiopia confirmed,"[Also COM] Colin item 212: My dear brothers, so rejoice and revel in the power of the miracle of Mary. Be strong in your true faith in our holy first fathers and devote yourselves to the love of Our Lady, the holy twice-virgin Mary, mother of God. In the time of the great number of Arians and of those who were far from the path of justice and were filled with a false doctrine, Our Lady did many wondrous acts in the countries of Egypt and Ethiopia and in the whole world. The brilliant light of these great miracles went and spread from one to another, filled with wonder those who heard and who saw, turned children’s thoughts toward God and drew the eyes of the people toward Our Lady Mary, the Virgin protectress. A few days after, you heard the miracles that Our Lady had done in succession in the country of Egypt. These miracles are written in another part of the Book of Miracles. Now we will tell you what she did in the country of Ethiopia in these days. There was a woman named Âlam Tsahay in the country of Ethiopia, in the urban area of Addis-Abeba, who suffered from stomach aches. Many times, she cried because of these painful aches that gave her no rest, neither day nor night. She spent all of her money on doctors and practitioners. They could not, however, cure her of her illness. One day, she wept and lamented before the icon of Our Lady which was in her house, bowed upon her face. Because of the greatness of her weakness and of her affliction, a torpor came upon her and she fell asleep. Immediately, Our Lady appeared to her, embracing a small child, similarly to the icon which was in her house. She was dressed in golden clothing. Our Lady said to the woman, “My daughter, have no fear, for it is I who will heal you, cure you of your stomach aches and force out the evil that tortures you.” Then Our Lady breathed on the woman’s nostril, then her stomach opened. After she had breathed again, the stomach closed and returned to its previous state. The woman was cured by this breath. Our Lady turned her face toward the woman and said to her, “So it is that I accomplished your healing by the power of my beloved son Jesus Christ; you are cured of your illness. Now tell the people all that I did for you.” Having said this, Our Lady disappeared from her sight. At that moment, the woman cried and said, “My Lady, yes, I will recount all that you did for me.” She rose abruptly like a man who wakes with a start. So her parents were afraid. After she had known the thought of Our Lady, Âlam Tsahay said to her parents, “Have no fear and do not be frightened; my Lady ordered me to tell of her miracle thanks to which she healed and cured me. I beg you, see with your eyes and test with your fingers whether there is upon me an ache, but I have none: observe and make sure.” When her parents saw that the woman was in good health and cured, their hearts were filled with joy. First and foremost, the mother of the woman went running to the Saint of Saints Mary Church. She bowed before the icon of Our Lady and lit an altar candle. She praised God, dispenser of life, and gave thanks to Our Lady for the rapid aid. This woman, Âlam Tsahay, stayed to tell the miracle of Our Lady, the holy twice-virgin Mary, Mother of God, and to commemorate it each year of the sixteenth of yakkâtit. O you people of Christians, just as we have heard told the miracles of Our Lady of former days, from the mouth of our first fathers, and as we have read in the book, so we have seen in our days. In fact, it is not at only one moment that Our Lady appears and does miracles - and she does not do miracles in a limited way -, but she does them at each moment, until the end of the world,because her beloved Son gave her the grace to do so. Glory and honor to Him with His celestial Father and the life-giving [vivifiant; can also mean restorative or invigorating] Holy Spirit for ever and ever! (translation by Allie V.

1227,(New) An Ethiopian girl who converts to Protestantism falls ill and is healed by Mary and then returns to the faith,Africa Ethiopia confirmed,"[Also COM] Colin item 213: There was a young girl named Second in the urban area of Addis-Ababa. She loved Our Lady Mary, twice-virgin, since her childhood with all her thought and all her heart, she was zealous in her faith. But Satan, the enemy of good, began to tempt her. Because of this, she changed her faith by the pleasing words and the scheme of Satan; she abandoned Our Lady. Three months after, this young girl fell ill; her tongue was tied and she lost sense to the point of being unable to distinguish men from women. Because of this, her parents were greatly frightened and brought her quickly to the Holy Water of Our Lady Mary. So she immersed herself and was cured of her illness. Three days after, she returned to her house in peace. But the enemy of good sowed again the evil seed [herbe] of doubt in her heart and she rebelled against the work of God and the power of the miracle of Our Lady Mary, the Virgin Mother of God. Three months after, this young girl named Second fell ill again, like before. So they said to her, “Come, let’s bring you to the Holy Water of Mary, immerse yourself within.” She refused and said, “Bring me only to the doctor.” They took her to the hospital of Ménélik II, but the doctors of the hospital could not cure her. While the young girl suffered thus from a terrible illness, on the 30th of yakkâtit, the Holy Spirit suddenly inspired a beautiful thought in her and she said to her mother, “Bring me to the Holy Water of Our Lady Mary.” So the people of her house rejoiced and brought her to the Holy Water. She immersed herself within for three days, but she did not find healing nor the recovery of her health. At that moment, her parents grieved and lost hope. The third day, in the middle of the night, Our Lady appeared in a vision to this young girl named Second and said to her, “Have you come again?” The young girl replied and said, bowing her head [cou, literally neck], in great fear and with much shame, “Yes, O My Lady.” Our Lady said to her, “My girl, have no fear and do not bow your head, rather be strong and resistant.” Then Our Lady stood on a tall mountain and said to the young girl, “So, speak.” The young girl replied and said, “How would I speak, O My Lady, as my throat is closed?” Our Lady said again to the young girl, “Drink from this spring of water which flows beneath you.” At that moment, Second drank twice; however, the water did not enter her stomach, but cauterized her throat and stayed there. But when she drank a third ti, this holy water descended, splitting her heart, taking this illness which strangled her throat and clutched her heart. Second said, “Woe is me, woe is me, hy heart is split and my back is made liquid!” So Our Lady said, “My girl, you are completely cured; nothing will do evil to or strike you. Now praise God who saved you of this terrible illness, out loud and with great cries.” Then she disappeared from her sight. At that hour, in the middle of the night, the young girl cried, as Our Lady had told her, praised God out loud and gave thanks to Our Lady, the holy twice-virgin Mary, Mother of God, the intercessor of mercy and of clemency. But when her parents heard this cry beyond compare, they were frightened, came quickly beside her and said to her, “What is wrong?” She told them what she had seen in her dream and how God had cured her by the intercession of His holy mother. So her parents and all the people who were assembled there for the immersion (of the young girl) in the Holy Water said, “Prodigious is the act of God who gave mercy to a (plant) with many ill branches; may Our Lady, the doer of many wonders, be blessed to all!” After she had completely recovered her health and her tongue was untied, the young girl made penance and came back to her former faith. She devoted herself to the love of Our Lady and served her twice more. My brothers, see thus how on this day was accomplished what the prophet Isaiah said: “Those who hated and scorned you will thus come beside you; they will bow before you and lick the dust of your feet.” He said this about Our Lady Mary, the Virgin Mother of God.

Mary prays in ""Hebrew'' before she drinks. She then avenges herself by praying in ""Hebrew'' to the Lord to show his power on the people. The earth opened her mouth and swallowed all of them up. Although no one survived except her this gets heard around in Judah and Galilee. Then, she meets a demoniac (who resembles the Gadarene Demoniac) and asks her to heal him. She prays in ""Hebrew'' and heals him. The demon stood before her as a pig. The demon-pig asks her to judge between the man and it. The demon-pig accuses the man for not honoring the Sabbath of God, theft, adultery, murder, and justifies why it possessed the man. She replied to it, ""How much you mock humanity? You told me all the deeds of this man. Is your deed good?"" It replies, ""I eat the flesh of people and drink their blood.. I possess and make them fall down into the abyss of heavens and fire. They will scratch their body with rocks."" Mary rebukes it ""Keep quite! Go down into the sea. May your power never be over humans."" Then, the demon disappears. The man wanted to stay with Mary. But, she tells him to go to his relatives and tell what the Lord has done for him. He asks her to remember him in her prayer. She said ""do not be afraid. From now on nothing evil will get you except that good."" She moves on. Then, she entered into a town and found a boy who was an only child to his mother dead after being sick for a little while. Mary cried and said ""How old was he?"" the mother replied ""12 years."" Then, Mary prays in ""Hebrew"" grabs the right hand of the boy and ""Rise up! The Lord has shown his mercy upon you."" He rose up and opened his eyes. Mary told to those who were crying to give him something to eat. Then she entered the house of Joseph. Highly creative reworking of the Gospel stories!

She dwelt in the city on that night. But, she did not eat or drink. At midnight God sends the angel of death with the army of darkness. They took out the souls of the people by force (deceit/ sorcery/hard labor). No one was spared whether it was a man or a woman for God was enthroned on his wrath. The end of darkness took them. When the Holy Family wakes up in the morning, they were not hearing any human noise. (It was too quite.) Our Lady says to Joseph, ""Don't you know what happened to them?""

One is about an old man whose name is Aqttisor who had some quarrel with a sorcerer. When the old man refused to sacrifice for gods the sorcerer killed all the 67 children of the old man. Mary sees him sad and asks him the matter. After learning about the reason she rejuvenates him and brings back his children to life. when she sees all plenitude of progeny. She asks ""How many were your women who gave birth for you?"" He replies just ""10."" She tells him that he is a gentile. Then, she blesses the children not to be possessed by eveil spirits again. She orders Michael and Gabriel to kill the sorcerer and his 97 big household. The old man asks her whether she was the god who was born recently. She tells him that she is His mother. then, tells the old man to go to his town and tell the wonderful works of God.  Afterthat, she goes back to the town of T'eman (the evil woman who was turned into a baboon with her family.) The people of town became terrified when they saw Mary and ask her ""Why do you multiply anger? Why do you become angry so fast? You know wisdom, being satiated and being hungry."" She replies ""Where do you know me that I am an angry person?"" They tell her that they know what she did to T'eman and her family. She tells them that they too will be like them if they keep treasuring arrogance. They invite her into their town. She asks them how the T'eman family is doing. The people relate to her that they try to bring them (the babooned T'eman family) back to their home; but they keep fleeing away down the clifs. She tells them that they can only bring the T'eman family back to their homes if the Hyenas and wolves can live in homes. The people went glorifying the Lord. Then, they bring to her oxen, cows, sheep and wheat, cup of wine, honey. They tell her ""Eat and rejoice!"" She tells them that she knows what they are thinking. That they want her to turn the Babooned family back to humanity. She refuses to do so. They go to Joseph and ask him the same thing. He tells them ""Becareful not to say this before our Lady. You will make her angry and she will turn yourselves into baboons. You go to your homes. I will consult her and implore on behalf of them. Whatever she tells me, I will tell you in the morning."" Joseph, then, comes to Mary. Before he even says a word. ""Take wickedness from your heart!"" He says ""I do not have any wickedness against you or your son."" She replies ""I know what you want to ask me about those people whom my son made into baboons."" She takes a staff and threw it on the ground saying ""May the God of Israel make me like this if I show mercy upon them whether in heaven or on earth!""

Salome comes and begs Mary and tells her that Joseph is very sad. Mary goes to the wilderness to find Jospeh. Salome tries to console him. He asks to be turned into a baboon like the people of the town. Mary consoles him by telling him how a wonderful father he is. They then moved away from that town and reached the town of Adiebon. At the 9th hour Mary stands and prays in ""Hebrew"" and prostrates 40 times (like a typical Ethiopian hermit. The tombs of the gentiles become opened and 702 men, 840 women, 5000 virgins, 900 youth, 50000 children, 6000 old people rose and they prostrated before Mary. When she sees this she hits her chest, rise her eyes to heaven, stretches her hands and prayed about the risen people not to be sent into death again. Then, Joseph tells her to send the people to their families for there are no houses in the desert. Mary replies that it is not fitting for them to go without they (Mary and Joseph) give to them some hope. As they were speaking this Gabriel came down and prostrate, danced, and knelt before Mary and tells her to follow him with the people. He brought them to a sea shore and spoke in the ""language of the angels."" The sea got parted to the right and to the left. he brought them into the heart of the sea. They found there houses built with gold (7000), silver (7000), copper (7000), jacinth (7000), sapphir (7000), diamond (9000), pearl (7000), jasper (7000), sardian (7000), jaspid (7000), jopolonia (7000), akmyas (6000), nfltom (6000), qrmnafl and serkias (6000), and countless houses built with wood and stones. The people who live there glorifying the Lord came out singing with the branches of hefienyos, biersabeq, qernamena, olive, other plants to receive Mary. These people signify in their song that they were hidden by God there at the time of Elijah the prophet. There also some mythical creatures living down there who come out to wreck havoc on earth when they are told to do so by God. These creatures are hidden from human eyes because people would have stopped procreation had they seen them. Mary wants for humanity to know about this reality that they might be saved. Gabriel tells her to pray for them. This is a well written play with three Acts!

It is better for me to live in the wilderness than this sadness and groaning."" Our Lady Mary the two fold virgin, the mother of God said ""Far be it from you, my father! Please, don't speak like this! For a meek person [sadly] can be included in the punishment of the wicked. A wise person flees from all punishment. It is possible for the wise. Why are you joining yourself with the rebellios?"" Joseph said ""O our Lady, rise up, let us go away from this cursed country. For anyone who lives in this country he becomes cursed himself."" They rose and passed from there until they reached Eeyoobon which was a city close to the sea. Our Lady Mary the two fold virgin the mother of God became tired. She sat down beneath a tree. At the 9th hour of the day she stood up to pray as usual. She put the baby on the ground. She prayed for a long time. She said ""Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel."" After she said this, she did 30 prostrations on the ground. Then, the tombs of the ancient fathers became opened. Their dead bodies of 709 men, 840 women, 5000 virgins, 900 youth, 9000 children, 62 old people rose up quickly. They bowed down at the feet of our Lady Mary the two fold virgin the mother of God. Seeing this miracle Mary hit her chest lifted her eyes to heaven, stretched out her hands and said ""Blessed is the Lord the God of our fathers who created all and who is feared by all.

Listen to the prayer of your servant. Do not return these people back to a state of desolation. The life of this world is like a smoke which the wind disperses and like a dream that vanishes in the morning."" Our  Lord Jesus Christ said ""O my mother let it be as you said.""

She, then, reached Tebaydar which is close to the Lake of Genesieres and stays there for three days while the angels serve her. She then moved to the town of Eldas the son of Ttamon. The people received her with weapons and making commotion. She left them and went away. Then, she reached Giet and stayed there while the angels serve her. When she prays a word came that says ""Enter into the city for you will defeat them and they will be defeated."" She returns to city. When they saw her the people rose with weapons. She blesses them (with her hand) all their hands become paralysed. They ask her what she wants. She replies ""May your gold be for destruction and obliteration."" They say ""The gods have come down to us in the likeness of humanbeings."" She responds ""I am not what you think of me. I am a traveller from the land of Judah. My name is [A]ngiesielemana.

Then, they arrive at the Kingdom of the Heavens. Its silver gate is locked with gold and sealed with the cross. Mary wonders how it is going to be opened. Uriel says ""Pilasoron, Pilasor, Piparoos, Paroos, Yawier, Lemanyanos."" The gate becomes opened by itself. Mary fell down on the ground from the power of the shining light. The angel lifts her up.

He was always solicitous to please her by divine faith and trusted in her from his youth. He was diligent in building her churches in the land of Amhara. He built (one) and called it Hagärä [Maryam]; in Cota he built (one) and called it Serha [Maryam/Sayon]; in Meyat (he built) Beta Giyorgis; in its vicinity to the north, (he built) Mäqdäsä Gäbre'el; and in the land of Damot, he built (one) and called it *Azädä Maryam. He would place (in each) a holy tabot with the sign of his name, Sem'on, and (that of) his father, Nagada Iyyasus. He would give his church brocades, curtains, linens and shirts embellished with high quality (of silk?) and gold, and many garments of marvelous work of red silk with gold, and items of bronze (such as) for official occasion, chalice and paten, and cross spoon made of silver, censer, cross and holy books and trapping of gold and silver, chalice and paten of silver, floor covering of carpet and floor coverings of other (kinds), baldachins, aspergillas, drums, trumpet, and horn to be blown, (all of) which he acquired by her grace and by his diligence. He was ablaze with the love of the Church like a flame in grass. The water of sorrow never cooled it, not the desire for passing wealth. The fear of the vicissitudes of time did not intimidate him. He would say (quoting) from the words of Paul, “Who will separate me from the love of Christ, her Son? Will suffering, tribulation, hunger, persecution, nakedness, or sword? Neither life nor death, nor angels (nor things past, nor things present, nor) things to come (will be able to separate me)."" He saw all these calamities during the disturbance of the Muslims, when they killed soul(s) by the tribulation of hunger, persecution, nakedness (and) the sword, and (when) he kept alive those who believed in the teaching of his father, the Satanic Muhammad, the Devil, (of course) until Christ takes vengeance on them with his wrath drowning (them) in the fire of damnation and (delivering them to) the damned Satan. But Sam' on did not fear the disturbance of the renegade because of the good pleasure of the Holy Spirit and the miracle(s) of Our Queen [...], he proposed on her behalf—because the renegade had burned her churches—to build a shrine, to excavate on rocky land he had found in Wäläqa, which some one else had started earlier, a small cave in which animals were dwelling. The person who built it in a rectangular form must have meant it either for a church or for a dwelling of his animals. When (Sam'on) quietly saw the rocky cave with his attendants, he said to them, ""With desire I have desired this rock to build it for a church."" No one dared to respond to his word in order to dissuade him. He gave orders that they improve the structure of its entry way so that its door might close quickly. It was good. Entering into what had been excavated as far as the height of a man, (with) its width 5 cubits and its length 10 cubits, he prayed, saying, ""O My Lady, listen to my petition concerning my desire, and grant me the power to build this shrine of yours. Let your good pleasure and the will of your Son Jesus Christ be done; and let the Holy Spirit overshadow it so that the malignant evil eye may not see it. And shut the ear of the Muslims so that they may not prevent me."" He laid out the structure so that the columns would be (...?), the inner breadth would measure 27 (cubits); the visible height, and the width would be limited to 18 (cubits); its doors, the external length 33, and external width and its windows made according to the eye of his mind. And its external fence and its building appearing as though [an architect] had laid it out on land. This is a miracle of Our Lady (Mary) and the good pleasure of the Holy Spirit. Who could do this (which I, friend of Mary, have done) other than Abraham, friend of God? There was fulfilled in him that which the apostles have said, ""You have given light to our inward eye(s), and have overshadowed the darkness of our mind with the knowledge of yourself.""

Our Lady stayed there for six months. The people of the country, men, women, old people and children, were coming to her to be blessed. She blessed them saying ""May there never be a barren woman in your country. May the women of your country give birth to two children each, one boy and one girl. May they never die without becoming old aged."" The people said ""Amen!"" ""Also, May your cattle, horses, camels, and sheep give birth to two offsprings each, one male and one female."" The people said ""Amen!"" Again she said to them ""May the Lord bless your cities, your vineyards, your fruit trees, your celeries, your hyssop, and your oil to give a perfect ointment."" The people said ""Amen!"" Then, the people said ""O our Lady, please, dwell with us. We will do anything you want. You just be our Father and Mother."" Our Lady Holy Mary the two fold virgin the mother of God said ""Such an act will not be from me but from my son."" The people said ""We knew [your coming] before you came. The angel Sooryal told us saying 'Our Lady Holy Mary the two fold virgin the mother of Godwill come to you with her beloved son, who is God the eternal king.' As we have heard we have seen."" After she stayed there for six months she also stayed for three more months. The sumtotal is nine months. She blessed that country and named her 'Nazareth.' Then, [the angels] Michael, Gabriel, Uriel, Rafael, Sedakyal and Selatyal came and stood before her. They brought bread, honeycomb, a goblet of grapes from heaven, and a cup filled with heavenly drink so that she might know the matter (that she was not supposed to live there longer than this) precisely. (EMML6835 so that you may know the great precision of the matter that the banquet was not an earthly one but heavenly). All the angels were commotining about and blasting 72 trumpets. The people gathered. She made them take their respective seats. The sat down ate to their fill and become satiated. They (the people/ the holy family/ both?) stayed there for seven Sabbaths eating and drinking. (EMML 6835 lacks 'seven sabbaths' instead adds: What (day) is like that day? Which (day) is like that day of salvation, the Sabbath of the Christians?!) Because of this the Scripture says ""He (Jesus) was raised in Nazareth."" For in the wisdom of God is mysterious for the human mind. The angels ascended to heaven. The people went to their houses praising our Lady Holy Mary the two fold virgin the mother of God, (EMML 6835: praising God) who has shown them this miracle. Our Lady Mary stayed in the sea for 10 days. Then, Gabriel came to her. He bowed down before her and greeted her saying ""Hail! The joy you have so far is enough. You have rejoiced and saw the glory of the Lord. Do not seek two worlds. It is fitting for you to be sad in this world. For the reward of sadness is joy [in the next]."" After saying this, the angel ascended to heaven. (EMML 6835: Our Lady mary began to be sad and cry. She said ""It would be better for me to die here than live. Listen, daughters of Israel and Jerusalem and the daughters of Bethlehem, a dog that eats in his master's house is better than me. Listen, young and old who live in the land of Egypt and Nphtali, had such a thing happened [before]? Lament over my orphanness. Lord, Lord, the evil spirits and human beings are in your hands. You kill and give life. Is my life greater than anyone? Why don't you take me to my father that I might get a little rest?"" The child spoke ""For your sake I suspended the sky. For your sake, I stretched out the earth. For your sake, I created all that is visible. Why are you crying like this? For your lament will be changed into joy. Your mourning will be rest for the whole world. There is a day that those who make you cry will cry and those who persecuted you will be persecuted. Blessed is the one who remembers you on this earth. Truly, truly, I say to you any one who gives a cup of cold water in your name his sin I will not remember. I will make him great in the heavenly kingdom. Let anyone who gives bread of half of bread, or wine, honeycomb in your name be a portion for you. If they visit the sick or release the imprisoned, or consoled the sad in the day of your commemoration, let them be your portion and [beneficiaries of your] pact forever and ever. Let them enter to the kingdom of heaven where you have entered, O Mary my mother. There is no one who is like you whether in heaven above or on the earth below. I love you so much. And I love all those who love you. I curse those who curse you. I will blot out their rememberance from generations. O Mary my mother do you think that I came for a kingdom beneath the earth? Why are you loving living in the deep sea? Besides, who can conquer you while I am with you?"" The child became quite after saying this.

Numberless is the miracles and wonders that are done everyday in the sanctuary of our mother Tsyon the Guardian of Axum. However, we heard [this one] from our holy fathers that the holy spirit descends three times every hour. First, during the prayer of incense. Second, when the Book of the Miracle of our Lady Mary is read. Third, at the time of the Eucharist. Notice and understand that when the Holy Spirit descends in the sanctuary of our mother Tsyon the Guardian of Axum the abode of the Great King, the aroma of the incense and the oblation captivates one's heart. The holy spirit also descends in all the waters [of the sanctuary?]. At the tenth hour of the day the holy spirit comes down and all the demons flee. On the tenth hour of the night angels descend with the sound of their wings. Hearing the sound of their wings the rooster crows and the whole world rejoices. O the people of Ethiopia, why are you desiring [to go to] Jerusalem? Behold, Jerusalem is the santuary of our mother Tsyon the Guardian of Axum who is in your midst. But, it is as our Lord says in the Gospel ""A prophet is not honored in his own country and even more among his own relatives.""  Foreigners, however, yearn for her. Do not disvalue my speech.

See the mystery of our mother, how she became the gate of heaven as Jacob saw the angels descend from heaven when he was in Loza. He said ""This is the gate of heaven. Here shall be built the house of the Lord."" Similarly, when Yared saw the angels descending to him while he was in Axum, he said ""What a melody! which I heard in heaven, until he said the beginning of Tsyon, He [God] made the heaven, secondly He showed it to Moses on how to make the Tabernacle."" Yared's chair that is made of stone still exists and is called the Rock of Yared. It is found in the opposite side of Tsyon's house.

It was as our Lord said in the Gospel ""You who have covered it from the knowledgeable ones and revealed it to babies."" O the people of Ethiopia, don't hate the land of Axum for she is your foundation. Without foundation the building can not stand. For there is great sign in her. On the side of the stelea there is one tree that resembles the Tree of Paradise (Etse Genet). Her leaves are wide. While her stem is one, it has three branches. One of them gives fruit on the Spring, another one gives fruit during Autumn. It becomes food for the birds of the sky and others whom we do not know. At the opposite side of that tree there is a pond from which the people of Axum drink from winter to summer (it doesn't dry up). Its taste makes one's heart rejoice and heals the sick. It is said that our Father Selama used to pray in it. Until today it does great miracles. If a menustrating woman enters into it to fetch water, when she looks at the water, it will appear to her as blood. However, its taste doesn't change.

5000,"(New, Arabic) A poor believer cannot sleep due to illness and pain, but St Mary gives him rest and then heals him",,"There was a believing man, a poor one, who sought refuge with God and the lady Mary. A serious illness befell him and it spread to his head and his entire body. He suffered from fever and strong pain and he couldn’t sleep or stand or sit or lay on his back nor on his side. And this went on for a week. And on the night of the first day of the month ??, the remembrance of the birth of Mary? And the lady Mary called upon the priest of the church and ordered him to perform the Eucharist on this day and on that night because she empathizes with the sick man. And he said “O daughter of the blessed Joachim and Hannah, with your guidance lead me O mother of blessings.” And he would say these words on the first night to the very last one. And then sleep would descend upon him and he would rest even though he hadn’t rested for a week. And he saw in his dream a noble, beautiful woman of white color (radiant?) and she came up towards him in the dream and took an edge of his blanket with her blanket and covered his head with it. And she said “there is no peace in the hearts of women, that is why they need to cover their heads.” And she kept his head covered with her hands. This was a great sign. And on the day of the remembrance of the birth of Mary she said “I will go to the church to be present at the Eucharist” And when he opened his eyes to follow the light, he saw ? greeting the whole community and he started to shake his head to check if the healing worked and he fell on his back and then on his side and he couldn’t find any trace of suffering at all as if he had never been ill at all, he was very happy. And this confirmed that the lady Mary had given him his healing on the day of her great remembrance. And when the priest came from the church after the Eucharist, he found him sitting on the bed and he was very happy. And he knew from just seeing him how the lady Mary had helped him and healed him and the two of them together praised God and thanked our lady Mary and praised her for this miracle.

And on some days he would be struck by heavy illness, he would drop on the ground from pain and he would cry out from pain “Take care of me O lady Mary, I am in your hands and I seek refuge from you for my pain and suffering, O mother of Jesus.” And when he was struggling from pain and suffering and on some nights his pain would increase even further and he would feel as if his back was about to crack open and as if he was about to become al-bab. And he would keep under his head a book of the miracles of our lady Mary. And then he thought to put it under his back when he was in pain. And he was able to sleep for a little bit because of the force of Mary. And this becalmed his pain and sleep and calm came to him until the morning and he slept with the book under his back. When he woke up, he didn’t find any pain there. And on the second night, he touched the book of Miracles of Mary which was under his back and he said “O lady Mary, protect all of the poor people and all of the sad people with your words of healing and help me get better.” And he said that prayer again and he said “there is no other book like the book of your miracles. It provides motivation to give you holy allegiance.” And after he said this, again he was able to fall asleep and he was temporarily healed and in the morning he looked as if he had never been ill and he was amazed by this great miracle.
